SNF SAS\n\n\n\n LOURIE, Circuit Judge.\n      Solenis Technologies L.P. (\u201cSolenis\u201d) appeals from the\n decision of the United States Patent Office Trial and Ap-\n peal Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection\n of claims 2\u201355 of U.S. Patent 6,454,902 (\u201cthe \u2019902 patent\u201d)\n in an inter partes reexamination. SNF SAS v. Ciba Speci-\n ality Chems. Water Treatments Ltd., No. 2015-007695,\n 2018 WL 3456088, at *1 (P.T.A.B. July 16, 2018) (\u201cSecond\n Board Decision\u201d), reh\u2019g denied, 2019 WL 1580145 (P.T.A.B.\n Apr. 10, 2019). For the reasons detailed below, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     Generally, to make paper, an aqueous suspension\n called cellulosic stock is fed into a headbox of a papermak-\n ing machine. The process may involve the addition of \u201cfloc-\n culating\u201d solutions, which cause the cellulosic stock to\n clump.\n     The \u2019902 patent provides a process for making paper\n from cellulosic stock using two flocculating steps. The pro-\n cess involves forming a cellulosic suspension, flocculating\n the suspension, draining the suspension on a screen to\n form a sheet, drying the sheet, mechanically shearing it,\n and then flocculating it again.\n     The parties\u2019 arguments in this appeal focus on two\n claims: claim 10 and claim 13. In the proceedings below,\n claim 1 was cancelled, and its limitations were imported\n into amended claim 13. Claim 1 recites:\n    1. A process for making paper or paper board com-\n    prising forming a cellulosic suspension, flocculat-\n    ing the suspension, draining the suspension on a\n    screen to form a sheet and then drying the sheet,\n    wherein the cellulosic suspension is flocculated by\n    the addition of a water soluble cationic synthetic\n    polymer of intrinsic viscosity of at least 4 dl/g,\n    wherein the flocculated cellulosic suspension is\n    subjected to mechanical shearing and then\n\fCase: 19-2013     Document: 43      Page: 3    Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS                      3\n\n\n\n     reflocculated by a subsequent addition of a refloc-\n     culating system, and in which the reflocculating\n     system comprises\n         i) a siliceous material and\n         ii) a water soluble anionic polymer of in-\n         trinsic viscosity at least 4 dl/g, and in\n         which the siliceous material (i) and water\n         soluble anionic polymer (ii) are added to the\n         cellulosic suspension subsequent to the\n         centriscreen and wherein the cationic poly-\n         mer is added to a thin stock stream of the\n         cellulosic suspension.\n \u2019902 patent col. 13 ll. 29\u201345 (emphases added). The \u201ccen-\n triscreen\u201d appears to be a shearing step, and the specifica-\n tion describes the reflocculating polymer as being added\n late in the papermaking process. Claim 13 depends from\n claim 1, reciting \u201c[a] process according to claim 1 in which\n the water soluble anionic polymer has an intrinsic viscosity\n of at least 7 dl/g.\u201d Id. at col. 14 ll. 33\u201335 (emphasis added).\n      Claim 10 also depends from cancelled claim 1 and re-\n cites a process for making paper or paper board wherein\n the second flocculating step uses a \u201cbranched\u201d \u201cwater solu-\n ble polymer which exhibits a rheological oscillation value\n of tan delta at 0.005 Hz of above 0.7 (calculated on a 1.5%\n by weight aqueous solution of the polymer).\u201d Id. at col. 14\n ll. 22\u201326. All claims in this appeal rise and fall with either\n claim 10 or 13.\n      SNF SAS (\u201cSNF\u201d) filed a request for inter partes reex-\n amination, which was ordered for claims 1\u20139 and 11\u201318.\n Solenis then cancelled claim 1, amended claim 13 to incor-\n porate its limitations, and added new claims 26\u201355. See\n J.A. 1553. The examiner, in his discretion, brought claim\n 10 into the reexamination as well. J.A. 1511.\n     The reexamination produced a series of opinions, but\n the relevant history is as follows. The examiner rejected\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43     Page: 4   Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                      SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS\n\n\n\n claim 13 but allowed claim 10. Solenis appealed to the\n Board, and the Board affirmed the rejection of claim 13 but\n issued a new ground of rejection for claim 10. SNF SAS v.\n Ciba Speciality Chems. Water Treatments Ltd., No. 2015-\n 007695, 2016 WL 4437952, at *1 (P.T.A.B. Aug. 19, 2016)\n (\u201cFirst Board Decision\u201d). Solenis requested to reopen pros-\n ecution, arguing that the Board issued a new ground of re-\n jection for both claim 10 and 13, J.A. 2046\u20132076, but the\n Board disagreed and declined to remand claim 13. SNF\n SAS v. Ciba Speciality Chems. Water Treatments Ltd., No.\n 2015-007695 (P.T.A.B. Feb. 28, 2017) (\u201cRemand Order\u201d).\n On remand, the examiner allowed claim 10, but the Board\n reversed the examiner again. Second Board Decision, 2018\n WL 3456088, at *5. Solenis then moved for rehearing,\n which was denied. SNF SAS v. Ciba Speciality Chems. Wa-\n ter Treatments Ltd., No. 2015-007695, 2019 WL 1580145,\n at *1 (P.T.A.B. Apr. 10, 2019) (\u201cRehearing Decision\u201d).\n     Relevant to this appeal are three references:\n WO 98/24973 (\u201cWO \u2019973\u201d); European Patent Application\n EP 0877120 A1 (\u201cEP \u2019120\u201d); and U.S. Patent 5,958,188\n (\u201cthe \u2019188 patent\u201d). WO \u2019973 discloses a process for making\n paper wherein a \u201cmain aqueous flow\u201d of cellulosic fibers\n and filler are fed into the headbox. WO \u2019973 at 3. The main\n flow comprises at least a \u201chigh consistency\u201d (HC) flow and\n a \u201clow consistency\u201d (LC) flow. Id. A cationic polymer is\n introduced into the HC flow as a retention agent. Id. at 8.\n WO \u2019973 specifies that cationic acrylamide-based polymers\n are preferred. Id. at 6. The LC flow may include an \u201caddi-\n tive\u201d that may comprise an anionic polymer. The molecular\n weight of the \u201cmain polymer\u201d is \u201cusually above 200,000,\n suitably above 300,000, preferably at least 500,000 and\n most preferably at least 1,000,000.\u201d Id. The polymer\n weight is below about 20,000,000. Id.\n     EP \u2019120 teaches a papermaking process that uses an\n ionic water-soluble polymer produced by dispersion\n polymerization. The disclosure teaches a method for pro-\n ducing the polymer by polymerizing water-soluble, ionic,\n\fCase: 19-2013     Document: 43      Page: 5    Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS                      5\n\n\n\n vinyl monomers under agitation in a salt solution. The\n \u201cpolymerization mechanism\u201d is not described, but the ap-\n plication states that \u201cit is assumed that a polymer having\n a specific molecular structure, such as a branched polymer\n or block copolymer, is produced\u201d and that \u201cthe specific mo-\n lecular structure\u201d of the produced polymer \u201cis a primary\n factor of improving retention and/or drainage.\u201d EP \u2019120 at\n 4.\n      The \u2019188 patent teaches a process for making paper\n where a polymer is made by reacting monomers. The spec-\n ification explains that \u201cone way of indicating that [a]\n branched polymer is in solution . . . rather than being in\n the form of cross linked particles is by observing that the\n defined tan delta value is relatively high (above 0.5 and\n preferably above 0.7).\u201d \u2019188 patent col. 4. ll. 26\u201336.\n     The Board\u2019s merits determinations for two claims are\n relevant to this appeal: (1) the rejection of claim 13 based\n on the Board\u2019s finding that WO \u2019973 discloses a cationic pol-\n ymer with an intrinsic viscosity of at least 4 dl/g and an\n anionic polymer with an intrinsic viscosity of at least 7 dl/g;\n and (2) the rejection of claim 10 based on the Board\u2019s find-\n ing that EP \u2019120 in view of the \u2019188 patent teaches a\n branched, water-soluble cationic polymer with a rheologi-\n cal oscillation value of tan delta at 0.005 Hz of above 0.7.\n The examiner considered both issues in the first instance.\n     The examiner relied on WO \u2019973 to teach both cationic\n and anionic polymers of the claimed intrinsic viscosities in\n claim 13. The examiner calculated the intrinsic viscosity\n of poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) with a weight range of\n 50,000 to 1.22 million, treating it as representative of both\n the cationic and anionic polymers of WO \u2019973.\n     To calculate the intrinsic viscosity of the prior art ma-\n terials, the examiner used the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada\n (MHS) equation:\n                          [n] = KMa.\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 6    Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                       SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS\n\n\n\n In the MHS equation, \u201c[n]\u201d is the intrinsic viscosity, \u201cK\u201d is\n a constant in dl/g, and \u201cM\u201d is the molecular weight. Relying\n on \u201cK\u201d and \u201ca\u201d values from the Polymer Handbook, 1 the ex-\n aminer calculated the intrinsic viscosity of poly(N,N\u2019-dime-\n thylacrylamide) as 16.8 dl/g. According to the examiner\u2019s\n determination, the intrinsic viscosity of WO \u2019973\u2019s \u201cpre-\n ferred polymer\u201d (i.e., an acrylamide-based polymer) at the\n preferred molecular weight met both claimed viscosity lim-\n itations.\n     Regarding claim 10, the examiner relied on a combina-\n tion of WO \u2019973, EP \u2019120, and the \u2019188 patent. The exam-\n iner found that WO \u2019973 teaches an LC flow, which may\n comprise an anionic polymer and preferably an acrylamide-\n based polymer with a molecular weight above 1 million.\n Relying on the value calculated above for poly(N,N\u2019-dime-\n thylacrylamide), the examiner found that the anionic poly-\n mer would also have an intrinsic viscosity of at least 16.8\n dl/g. But the examiner ultimately found claim 10 would\n not have been obvious because there was no disclosure in\n EP \u2019120 or the \u2019188 patent showing a cationic water-soluble\n polymer with the claimed rheological oscillation value.\n      On appeal, the Board affirmed the examiner\u2019s decision\n regarding intrinsic viscosity and claim 13. The Board spe-\n cifically agreed with the examiner\u2019s reliance on poly(N,N\u2019-\n dimethylacrylamide) as representative for cationic poly-\n mers because WO \u2019973 discloses cationic acrylamide-based\n polymers as particularly preferred with molecular weights\n of at least 1 to about 20 million. 2 The Board found no\n\n\n     1   POLYMER HANDBOOK, IV-21 (J. Brandrup & E.H.\n Immergut eds., 1966).\n     2   The Board also commented that high molecular\n weight cationic polymers used in retention systems are\n characterized by intrinsic viscosities of about 4 dl/g and\n that such cationic polymers have molecular weights above\n\fCase: 19-2013     Document: 43      Page: 7   Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS                     7\n\n\n\n evidence of record suggesting that poly(N,N\u2019-dime-\n thylacrylamide) could not be used as an example of an\n acrylamide-based polymer sufficient to establish the rela-\n tionship between intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight\n with respect to the polymers described in WO \u2019973. The\n Board also commented that Solenis had not explained why\n a cationic polymer would have a significantly different K\n value. Citing that WO \u2019973 discloses anionic polymers of\n similarly     high     weights\u2014most      preferably     above\n 10,000,000\u2014the Board extended its conclusion for the in-\n trinsic viscosity of the cationic polymer to the anionic poly-\n mer. First Board Decision, 2016 WL 4437952, at *7\u20138.\n     Regarding claim 10, the Board held that EP \u2019120 dis-\n closes water-soluble ionic polymers that are either\n branched polymers or block copolymers, which is the pri-\n mary factor in improving retention or drainage. Thus, the\n Board read EP \u2019120 to teach branched cationic polymers.\n Then, relying on the \u2019188 patent, the Board held that a\n branched polymer in solution has a relatively high tan\n delta value, above 0.5 and preferably above 0.7. Thus, the\n Board held that EP \u2019120 discloses water-soluble polymers,\n which would have a relatively high rheological oscillation\n value. In the Board\u2019s view, the value taught by the prior\n art matched that in the claims because the \u2019188 patent ex-\n pressly teaches that a tan delta of above 0.7 is preferred.\n Thus, the Board entered a new rejection of claim 10 as ob-\n vious over WO \u2019973 and EP \u2019120.\n     On remand to the examiner, Solenis submitted a dec-\n laration from its expert, Christian Jehn-Rendu, and the ex-\n aminer relied on the declaration to find that EP \u2019120\n discloses a polymer in a dispersion, and polymers in\n\n\n 500,000, but this finding was vacated on rehearing to make\n clear that the Board was affirming the examiner\u2019s ra-\n tionale and not providing a new basis for rejection. Rehear-\n ing Decision, 2019 WL 1580145, at *2.\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 8    Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n8                       SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS\n\n\n\n dispersions have a tan delta value of less than 0.5, outside\n the scope of the claim.\n     On appeal from that decision, the Board reversed. It\n found that EP \u2019120 did disclose a method for producing wa-\n ter-soluble cationic polymers by dispersion polymerization,\n but the dispersion was produced during polymer formula-\n tion. Ultimately, in the Board\u2019s view, the process yielded a\n water-soluble polymer. Alternatively, the Board also found\n that, even if the claim\u2019s oscillation value was not inherent\n in the water-soluble branched polymers of EP \u2019120, it would\n have been obvious to select a branched water-soluble poly-\n mer as taught by EP \u2019120 because of the desire for a water-\n soluble, easily-dissolvable cationic polymer. According to\n the Board, a \u201cskilled artisan would seek to utilize a fine\n cationic polymer exhibiting a tan delta above 0.7 due to the\n express disclosure in the \u2019188 patent that polymer systems\n having a tan delta value above 0.7 have more soluble poly-\n mer and less cross-linked polymer.\u201d Second Board Deci-\n sion, 2018 WL 3456088 at *5.\n     Solenis moved for rehearing on all the above issues, but\n the Board reiterated its previous reasoning and denied re-\n hearing. Solenis appealed, and we have jurisdiction under\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A).\n                         DISCUSSION\n     We review the Board\u2019s legal determinations de novo, In\n re Elsner, 381 F.3d 1125, 1127 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and its fact\n findings for substantial evidence, In re Gartside, 203 F.3d\n 1305, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

The use of inherency, however, \u201cmust be carefully\n circumscribed in the context of obviousness.\u201d PAR Pharm.,\n Inc. v. TWI Pharm., Inc., 773 F.3d 1186, 1195 (Fed.

We address each issue in turn.\n                               A.\n     Solenis argues that the Board\u2019s determinations for\n claim 13\u2019s intrinsic viscosity limitations and claim 10\u2019s rhe-\n ological oscillation value limitation lack substantial evi-\n dence.\n     First, Solenis challenges the examiner\u2019s and the\n Board\u2019s analysis regarding claim 13. According to Solenis,\n the examiner failed to provide sufficient detail concerning\n his MHS equation calculation and did not adequately ex-\n plain why poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) was representa-\n tive of all cationic and anionic polyacrylamides. Thus, in\n Solenis\u2019s view, the examiner failed to show that WO \u2019973\n necessarily and inherently discloses cationic and anionic\n polyacrylamides of the claimed intrinsic viscosities. SNF\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 10     Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                      SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS\n\n\n\n responds that the Board\u2019s decisions are supported by sub-\n stantial evidence and that the Board properly analyzed the\n record.\n     We agree with SNF. WO \u2019973 discloses cationic and\n anionic polymers with molecular weights of above 1 mil-\n lion. See WO \u2019973 at 6 (\u201cExamples of suitable main poly-\n mers include anionic, amphoteric and cationic acrylamide-\n based polymers . . . . The molecular weight of the main pol-\n ymer is usually above 200,000 . . . and most preferably at\n least 1,000,000.\u201d). Selection of an acrylamide-based poly-\n mer like poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) was reasonable on\n this record as acrylamides were designated in WO \u2018973 as\n preferred. Solenis may disagree with the examiner and\n Board\u2019s designation of poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) as\n representative, but the selection certainly meets the sub-\n stantial evidence standard on appeal. Consol. Edison, 305\n U.S. at 229.\n      We also agree with the examiner\u2019s and Board\u2019s deter-\n mination that the dimethylacrylamide polymer meets the\n intrinsic viscosity limitation of the claim. Solenis identifies\n no errors in the examiner\u2019s calculation using the MHS\n equation. Nor do we find error in his determination that,\n based on the MHS equation, intrinsic viscosity is propor-\n tional to molecular weight such that the intrinsic viscosity\n of the WO \u2019973 polymers with molecular weights preferably\n greater than 1 million would be expected to have higher\n intrinsic viscosities than 16.8 dl/g.\n     The Board and examiner used a well-known equation\n to determine an inherent property\u2014the intrinsic viscos-\n ity\u2014of a polymer in the prior art. The inherency of a\n claimed material is not at issue in this analysis; it is the\n inherency of a property that is at issue, and substantial ev-\n idence shows that the polymer possesses that property. We\n discern no error in this analysis.\n     Regarding claim 10, Solenis argues that EP \u2019120 does\n not inherently disclose branched polymers because the\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 11   Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS                   11\n\n\n\n disclosure does not specify whether branched or block co-\n polymers are formed. According to Solenis, because the EP\n \u2019120 polymers are not necessarily branched, the polymers\n do not necessarily have the claimed tan delta values. Sole-\n nis also argues that, since the EP \u2019120 polymers are not\n necessarily branched, the Board\u2019s alternative conclusion\n that EP \u2019120 would have motivated a person skilled in the\n art to use a branched, water-soluble cationic polymer lacks\n substantial evidence.\n     It is unclear that the Board relied on inherency to find\n polymers disclosed by EP \u2019120 are necessarily branched.\n The Board determined that it would have been obvious to\n use branched cationic polymers because EP \u2019120 discloses\n branched or block copolymers. EP \u2019120 describes a disper-\n sion polymerization reaction that yields a water-soluble\n polymer. The polymerization mechanism is unknown, and\n the inventors \u201cassumed that a polymer having a specific\n molecular structure, such as a branched polymer or block\n copolymer, is produced.\u201d EP \u2019120 at 4.\n     The Board\u2019s determination that \u201cit would have been ob-\n vious to optimize the water soluble cationic polymer to se-\n lect a branched soluble polymer as taught by EP \u2019120\n because of the desire for a water soluble and easily dissolv-\n able cationic polymer\u201d is supported by the record. Second\n Board Decision, 2018 WL 3456088, at *5. EP \u2019120 credits\n the structure of the generated polymer as a \u201cprimary factor\n of improving retention and/or drainage,\u201d and therefore\n teaches that a branched polymer may be responsible for\n improvements to the papermaking process. EP \u2019120 at 6.\n It was thus reasonable for the Board to conclude that it\n would have been obvious for a skilled artisan to use\n branched copolymers based on EP \u2019120\u2019s express disclosure,\n and the Board\u2019s obviousness conclusion is supported by\n substantial evidence.\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 12   Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                     SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS\n\n\n\n                              B.\n     After the first Board decision, Solenis requested reo-\n pening prosecution under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.77(b)(l) and sub-\n mitted the Jehn-Rendu declaration. The request was\n granted for claim 10, which was subject to a new ground of\n rejection, but was denied for claim 13. Remand Order, No.\n 2015-007695, slip op. at 3; J.A. 1975. Specifically, the\n Board entered a new ground of rejection based on its find-\n ing that a combination of WO \u2019973, EP \u2019120, and the \u2019188\n patent discloses branched polymers of a rheological oscilla-\n tion tan delta value of above 0.7.\n     As a preliminary matter, in its request to reopen pros-\n ecution, Solenis argued the issue of intrinsic viscosity with\n respect to claim 13 alone. See J.A. 1946\u201349. Solenis\u2019s ar-\n guments regarding claim 10 address only whether EP \u2019120\n and the \u2019188 patent disclose a branched water-soluble pol-\n ymer with the claimed rheological oscillation value. J.A.\n 1940\u201343. The examiner considered the declaration and the\n request in his determination on remand. J.A. 1989\u201390.\n Thus, it is not surprising that the examiner\u2019s analysis on\n remand addresses the Jehn-Rendu declaration only as it\n relates to the claimed tan delta value of claim 10.\n      On remand to the examiner after the Board issues a\n new ground of rejection, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.77(d) tasks the ex-\n aminer to consider whether new evidence not previously of\n record overcomes the new ground of rejection in the Board\u2019s\n decision. The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\n (\u201cMPEP\u201d) \u00a7 2682 (9th ed., rev. Jan. 2018), provides similar\n guidance, explaining that \u201cexaminer will not comment on\n any entered arguments or comments that are not limited\n to the new ground(s) of rejection issued in the Board\u2019s de-\n cision (e.g., arguments or comments that addressed a\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 13     Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v.

Solenis has failed\n to identify any procedural error warranting a remand.\n                         CONCLUSION\n      We have considered Solenis\u2019s remaining arguments but\n find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the decision of the\n Board finding claims 2\u201355 of the \u2019902 patent unpatentable\n is affirmed.\n                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n     3    \u201cWhile the MPEP does not have the force of law, it\n is entitled to judicial notice as an official interpretation of\n statutes or regulations as long as it is not in conflict there-\n with.\u201d Molins PLC v.

For the reasons detailed below, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     Generally, to make paper, an aqueous suspension\n called cellulosic stock is fed into a headbox of a papermak-\n ing machine. The process may involve the addition of \u201cfloc-\n culating\u201d solutions, which cause the cellulosic stock to\n clump.\n     The \u2019902 patent provides a process for making paper\n from cellulosic stock using two flocculating steps.

The spec-\n ification explains that \u201cone way of indicating that [a]\n branched polymer is in solution . . . rather than being in\n the form of cross linked particles is by observing that the\n defined tan delta value is relatively high (above 0.5 and\n preferably above 0.7).\u201d \u2019188 patent col. 4. ll. 26\u201336.\n     The Board\u2019s merits determinations for two claims are\n relevant to this appeal: (1) the rejection of claim 13 based\n on the Board\u2019s finding that WO \u2019973 discloses a cationic pol-\n ymer with an intrinsic viscosity of at least 4 dl/g and an\n anionic polymer with an intrinsic viscosity of at least 7 dl/g;\n and (2) the rejection of claim 10 based on the Board\u2019s find-\n ing that EP \u2019120 in view of the \u2019188 patent teaches a\n branched, water-soluble cationic polymer with a rheologi-\n cal oscillation value of tan delta at 0.005 Hz of above 0.7.\n The examiner considered both issues in the first instance.\n     The examiner relied on WO \u2019973 to teach both cationic\n and anionic polymers of the claimed intrinsic viscosities in\n claim 13. The examiner calculated the intrinsic viscosity\n of poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) with a weight range of\n 50,000 to 1.22 million, treating it as representative of both\n the cationic and anionic polymers of WO \u2019973.\n     To calculate the intrinsic viscosity of the prior art ma-\n terials, the examiner used the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada\n (MHS) equation:\n                          [n] = KMa.\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 6    Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                       SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v.

Relying\n on \u201cK\u201d and \u201ca\u201d values from the Polymer Handbook, 1 the ex-\n aminer calculated the intrinsic viscosity of poly(N,N\u2019-dime-\n thylacrylamide) as 16.8 dl/g. According to the examiner\u2019s\n determination, the intrinsic viscosity of WO \u2019973\u2019s \u201cpre-\n ferred polymer\u201d (i.e., an acrylamide-based polymer) at the\n preferred molecular weight met both claimed viscosity lim-\n itations.\n     Regarding claim 10, the examiner relied on a combina-\n tion of WO \u2019973, EP \u2019120, and the \u2019188 patent. The exam-\n iner found that WO \u2019973 teaches an LC flow, which may\n comprise an anionic polymer and preferably an acrylamide-\n based polymer with a molecular weight above 1 million.\n Relying on the value calculated above for poly(N,N\u2019-dime-\n thylacrylamide), the examiner found that the anionic poly-\n mer would also have an intrinsic viscosity of at least 16.8\n dl/g. But the examiner ultimately found claim 10 would\n not have been obvious because there was no disclosure in\n EP \u2019120 or the \u2019188 patent showing a cationic water-soluble\n polymer with the claimed rheological oscillation value.\n      On appeal, the Board affirmed the examiner\u2019s decision\n regarding intrinsic viscosity and claim 13. The Board spe-\n cifically agreed with the examiner\u2019s reliance on poly(N,N\u2019-\n dimethylacrylamide) as representative for cationic poly-\n mers because WO \u2019973 discloses cationic acrylamide-based\n polymers as particularly preferred with molecular weights\n of at least 1 to about 20 million. 2 The Board found no\n\n\n     1   POLYMER HANDBOOK, IV-21 (J.

The\n Board also commented that Solenis had not explained why\n a cationic polymer would have a significantly different K\n value.

Thus, the\n Board read EP \u2019120 to teach branched cationic polymers.\n Then, relying on the \u2019188 patent, the Board held that a\n branched polymer in solution has a relatively high tan\n delta value, above 0.5 and preferably above 0.7. Thus, the\n Board held that EP \u2019120 discloses water-soluble polymers,\n which would have a relatively high rheological oscillation\n value. In the Board\u2019s view, the value taught by the prior\n art matched that in the claims because the \u2019188 patent ex-\n pressly teaches that a tan delta of above 0.7 is preferred.\n Thus, the Board entered a new rejection of claim 10 as ob-\n vious over WO \u2019973 and EP \u2019120.\n     On remand to the examiner, Solenis submitted a dec-\n laration from its expert, Christian Jehn-Rendu, and the ex-\n aminer relied on the declaration to find that EP \u2019120\n discloses a polymer in a dispersion, and polymers in\n\n\n 500,000, but this finding was vacated on rehearing to make\n clear that the Board was affirming the examiner\u2019s ra-\n tionale and not providing a new basis for rejection.

It\n found that EP \u2019120 did disclose a method for producing wa-\n ter-soluble cationic polymers by dispersion polymerization,\n but the dispersion was produced during polymer formula-\n tion. Ultimately, in the Board\u2019s view, the process yielded a\n water-soluble polymer. Alternatively, the Board also found\n that, even if the claim\u2019s oscillation value was not inherent\n in the water-soluble branched polymers of EP \u2019120, it would\n have been obvious to select a branched water-soluble poly-\n mer as taught by EP \u2019120 because of the desire for a water-\n soluble, easily-dissolvable cationic polymer. According to\n the Board, a \u201cskilled artisan would seek to utilize a fine\n cationic polymer exhibiting a tan delta above 0.7 due to the\n express disclosure in the \u2019188 patent that polymer systems\n having a tan delta value above 0.7 have more soluble poly-\n mer and less cross-linked polymer.\u201d Second Board Deci-\n sion, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2018</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3456088</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">at *5.\n     Solenis moved for rehearing on all the above issues, but\n the Board reiterated its previous reasoning and denied re-\n hearing.

We address each issue in turn.\n                               A.\n     Solenis argues that the Board\u2019s determinations for\n claim 13\u2019s intrinsic viscosity limitations and claim 10\u2019s rhe-\n ological oscillation value limitation lack substantial evi-\n dence.\n     First, Solenis challenges the examiner\u2019s and the\n Board\u2019s analysis regarding claim 13. According to Solenis,\n the examiner failed to provide sufficient detail concerning\n his MHS equation calculation and did not adequately ex-\n plain why poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) was representa-\n tive of all cationic and anionic polyacrylamides. Thus, in\n Solenis\u2019s view, the examiner failed to show that WO \u2019973\n necessarily and inherently discloses cationic and anionic\n polyacrylamides of the claimed intrinsic viscosities. SNF\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 10     Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                      SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS\n\n\n\n responds that the Board\u2019s decisions are supported by sub-\n stantial evidence and that the Board properly analyzed the\n record.\n     We agree with SNF. WO \u2019973 discloses cationic and\n anionic polymers with molecular weights of above 1 mil-\n lion. See WO \u2019973 at 6 (\u201cExamples of suitable main poly-\n mers include anionic, amphoteric and cationic acrylamide-\n based polymers . . . . The molecular weight of the main pol-\n ymer is usually above 200,000 . . . and most preferably at\n least 1,000,000.\u201d). Selection of an acrylamide-based poly-\n mer like poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) was reasonable on\n this record as acrylamides were designated in WO \u2018973 as\n preferred. Solenis may disagree with the examiner and\n Board\u2019s designation of poly(N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide) as\n representative, but the selection certainly meets the sub-\n stantial evidence standard on appeal.

Solenis identifies\n no errors in the examiner\u2019s calculation using the MHS\n equation. Nor do we find error in his determination that,\n based on the MHS equation, intrinsic viscosity is propor-\n tional to molecular weight such that the intrinsic viscosity\n of the WO \u2019973 polymers with molecular weights preferably\n greater than 1 million would be expected to have higher\n intrinsic viscosities than 16.8 dl/g.\n     The Board and examiner used a well-known equation\n to determine an inherent property\u2014the intrinsic viscos-\n ity\u2014of a polymer in the prior art. The inherency of a\n claimed material is not at issue in this analysis; it is the\n inherency of a property that is at issue, and substantial ev-\n idence shows that the polymer possesses that property. We\n discern no error in this analysis.\n     Regarding claim 10, Solenis argues that EP \u2019120 does\n not inherently disclose branched polymers because the\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 11   Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS                   11\n\n\n\n disclosure does not specify whether branched or block co-\n polymers are formed. According to Solenis, because the EP\n \u2019120 polymers are not necessarily branched, the polymers\n do not necessarily have the claimed tan delta values. Sole-\n nis also argues that, since the EP \u2019120 polymers are not\n necessarily branched, the Board\u2019s alternative conclusion\n that EP \u2019120 would have motivated a person skilled in the\n art to use a branched, water-soluble cationic polymer lacks\n substantial evidence.\n     It is unclear that the Board relied on inherency to find\n polymers disclosed by EP \u2019120 are necessarily branched.\n The Board determined that it would have been obvious to\n use branched cationic polymers because EP \u2019120 discloses\n branched or block copolymers. EP \u2019120 describes a disper-\n sion polymerization reaction that yields a water-soluble\n polymer. The polymerization mechanism is unknown, and\n the inventors \u201cassumed that a polymer having a specific\n molecular structure, such as a branched polymer or block\n copolymer, is produced.\u201d EP \u2019120 at 4.\n     The Board\u2019s determination that \u201cit would have been ob-\n vious to optimize the water soluble cationic polymer to se-\n lect a branched soluble polymer as taught by EP \u2019120\n because of the desire for a water soluble and easily dissolv-\n able cationic polymer\u201d is supported by the record. Second\n Board Decision, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2018</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3456088</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. EP \u2019120 credits\n the structure of the generated polymer as a \u201cprimary factor\n of improving retention and/or drainage,\u201d and therefore\n teaches that a branched polymer may be responsible for\n improvements to the papermaking process. EP \u2019120 at 6.\n It was thus reasonable for the Board to conclude that it\n would have been obvious for a skilled artisan to use\n branched copolymers based on EP \u2019120\u2019s express disclosure,\n and the Board\u2019s obviousness conclusion is supported by\n substantial evidence.\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 12   Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                     SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS\n\n\n\n                              B.\n     After the first Board decision, Solenis requested reo-\n pening prosecution under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.77(b)(l) and sub-\n mitted the Jehn-Rendu declaration. The request was\n granted for claim 10, which was subject to a new ground of\n rejection, but was denied for claim 13. Remand Order, No.\n 2015-007695, slip op. at 3; J.A. 1975. Specifically, the\n Board entered a new ground of rejection based on its find-\n ing that a combination of WO \u2019973, EP \u2019120, and the \u2019188\n patent discloses branched polymers of a rheological oscilla-\n tion tan delta value of above 0.7.\n     As a preliminary matter, in its request to reopen pros-\n ecution, Solenis argued the issue of intrinsic viscosity with\n respect to claim 13 alone. See J.A. 1946\u201349. Solenis\u2019s ar-\n guments regarding claim 10 address only whether EP \u2019120\n and the \u2019188 patent disclose a branched water-soluble pol-\n ymer with the claimed rheological oscillation value. J.A.\n 1940\u201343. The examiner considered the declaration and the\n request in his determination on remand. J.A. 1989\u201390.\n Thus, it is not surprising that the examiner\u2019s analysis on\n remand addresses the Jehn-Rendu declaration only as it\n relates to the claimed tan delta value of claim 10.\n      On remand to the examiner after the Board issues a\n new ground of rejection, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.77(d) tasks the ex-\n aminer to consider whether new evidence not previously of\n record overcomes the new ground of rejection in the Board\u2019s\n decision. The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\n (\u201cMPEP\u201d) \u00a7 2682 (9th ed., rev. Jan. 2018), provides similar\n guidance, explaining that \u201cexaminer will not comment on\n any entered arguments or comments that are not limited\n to the new ground(s) of rejection issued in the Board\u2019s de-\n cision (e.g., arguments or comments that addressed a\n\fCase: 19-2013    Document: 43      Page: 13     Filed: 05/26/2020\n\n\n\n\n SOLENIS TECHNOLOGIES, L.P.   v. SNF SAS                     13\n\n\n\n rejection affirmed in the Board\u2019s decision).\u201d 3 The examiner\n clearly followed the applicable regulations and guidance in\n considering the Jehn-Rendu declaration for the limited\n purpose of the new ground of rejection. Solenis has failed\n to identify any procedural error warranting a remand.\n                         CONCLUSION\n      We have considered Solenis\u2019s remaining arguments but\n find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the decision of the\n Board finding claims 2\u201355 of the \u2019902 patent unpatentable\n is affirmed.\n                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n     3    \u201cWhile the MPEP does not have the force of law, it\n is entitled to judicial notice as an official interpretation of\n statutes or regulations as long as it is not in conflict there-\n with.\u201d Molins PLC v.

ZACHARY\n TERWILLIGER, Office of the United States Attorney, United\n States Department of Justice, Alexandria, VA.\n                 ______________________\n\n     Before LOURIE, REYNA, and HUGHES, Circuit Judges.\n HUGHES, Circuit Judge.\n     This case presents three Administrative Procedure Act\n challenges involving the United States Patent and Trade-\n mark Office. Odyssey challenges procedural actions taken\n by the PTO in two patent applications and makes a third\n facial challenge to certain PTO procedural rules governing\n practice before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in ex\n parte appeals. The Eastern District of Virginia dismissed\n the former two challenges for lack of subject matter juris-\n diction because the PTO had not taken final agency action.\n It dismissed the latter challenge as barred by 28 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2401, the six-year statute of limitations for challenges to\n agency action. Because we agree with the district court\n that the first two challenges concern non-final agency ac-\n tion and the latter challenge is barred by \u00a7 2401, we affirm.\n                               I\n     Odyssey Logistics and Technology Corporation (Odys-\n sey), disapproving of certain decisions of the PTO, chal-\n lenged the legality of those PTO decisions in district court\n under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The first\n challenge (Count I) relates to the prosecution of U.S. Pa-\n tent Application No. 11/005,678. The second challenge\n (Count II) relates to the prosecution of U.S. Patent Appli-\n cation No. 11/465,603. The third challenge (Count III) con-\n tests whether amendments to the Rules of Practice Before\n the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in Ex Parte\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47      Page: 3    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU                       3\n\n\n\n Appeals conform with the PTO\u2019s statutory authority. 1 See\n Rules of Practice Before the Board of Patent Appeals and\n Interferences in Ex Parte Appeals, 76 Fed. Reg. 72,270\n (Nov. 22, 2011) (codified at 37 C.F.R. pts. 1 and 41). We\n recount the factual and procedural history of each chal-\n lenge in turn.\n                              A\n     Count I arises from the examination of Odyssey\u2019s\n \u2019678 patent application. Odyssey filed the \u2019678 application\n in 2004. After a number of procedural disputes over the\n examination of the application, including multiple appeals\n to this Court, see In re Riggs, 457 F. App\u2019x 923 (Fed. Cir.\n 2011); Odyssey Logistics & Tech. Corp. v. Kappos, No. 11-\n 1441 (Fed. Cir. filed June 20, 2011) (voluntarily dismissed),\n the Patent Trial and Appeal Board heard Odyssey\u2019s appeal\n of the examiner\u2019s rejections in the \u2019678 application. On\n April 29, 2016, the Board reversed the examiner\u2019s rejec-\n tions. J.A. 1225, 1229\u201330. The PTO did not, however, is-\n sue Odyssey a notice of allowance for the \u2019678 application.\n     Instead, on September 23, 2016, the Technology Center\n Director issued what Odyssey refers to as the \u201cexaminer\u2019s\n request for rehearing.\u201d 2 Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14; J.A. 1267.\n The rehearing request argued that the Board had applied\n\n\n     1   These rules refer to the Board of Patent Appeals\n and Interferences because they were promulgated before\n the America Invents Act replaced the BPAI with the Patent\n Trial and Appeal Board on September 16, 2012. See Leahy-\n Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. No. 112-29, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 35,\n 125 Stat. 284, 313, 341 (Sept. 16, 2011) (codified as\n amended at 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 6). Because the relevant events\n here occurred after that date, we refer to the deciding ad-\n ministrative body as the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.\n     2   The PTO uses \u201crehearing\u201d to describe \u201creconsider-\n ation.\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.2.\n\fCase: 19-1066     Document: 47      Page: 4     Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                       ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU\n\n\n\n\n an incorrect version of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e) to determine\n whether a reference qualified as prior art and also re-\n quested clarification as to which claims the Board was re-\n versing. J.A. 1269\u201372. Odyssey was given the opportunity\n to respond to the rehearing request both before and after\n the Board received it. See J.A. 1282, 1371. On both occa-\n sions, Odyssey did not address the merits of the examiner\u2019s\n arguments, instead objecting to the procedural propriety of\n the rehearing request. See id. Odyssey also filed petitions\n objecting to the rehearing procedure, and requests for re-\n consideration when those petitions were dismissed. J.A.\n 1326, 1334, 1357, 1360, 1362. Odyssey eventually made\n some arguments on the merits \u201cunder protest,\u201d J.A. 1370,\n but instead of waiting for the Board\u2019s decision on these ar-\n guments, Odyssey filed this challenge to the request for re-\n hearing in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n                                B\n     Count II arises from the prosecution of Odyssey\u2019s \u2019603\n application. Odyssey filed the \u2019603 application in 2006. Af-\n ter a final rejection of all claims of the \u2019603 application, Od-\n yssey appealed the examiner\u2019s rejections and, at the same\n time, filed a petition demanding that the examiner make\n certain evidence part of the written record and supplement\n his responses to Odyssey\u2019s arguments with additional ex-\n planation. J.A. 1805, 1816; J.A. 1858. The examiner re-\n sponded, declining to include the additional evidence but\n further explaining his disagreement with Odyssey\u2019s argu-\n ments for allowance. Because the examiner had re-\n sponded, the Technology Center Director dismissed the\n petition as moot.\n     With this petition resolved, the examiner filed his an-\n swer to Odyssey\u2019s appeal brief. The examiner\u2019s answer did\n not designate any new grounds of rejection, see J.A. 1876,\n but Odyssey believed that the answer included new\n grounds, so Odyssey filed a new petition, requesting that\n the Technology Center Director designate certain portions\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47      Page: 5    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU                       5\n\n\n\n of the examiner\u2019s answer as new grounds of rejection. J.A.\n 1894. The Technology Center Director dismissed this peti-\n tion on the merits, finding that the portions of the answer\n with which Odyssey took issue did not set forth new\n grounds of rejection. J.A. 1910\u201313. Rather than filing a\n brief replying to the examiner\u2019s answer and waiting to see\n if the Board would strike certain portions of its reply as\n improper, Odyssey challenged the dismissal of the petition\n in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n                              C\n      Count III arises from the PTO\u2019s 2011 amendments to\n its rules of practice in ex parte appeals. See 76 Fed. Reg.\n 72,270. The PTO gave four purposes for these amend-\n ments: (1) \u201cto ensure that the Board has adequate infor-\n mation to decide ex parte appeals on the merits, while not\n unduly burdening appellants or examiners with unneces-\n sary briefing requirements\u201d; (2) \u201cto eliminate any gap in\n time from the end of briefing to the commencement of the\n Board\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d; (3) \u201cto clarify and simplify petitions\n practice on appeal\u201d; and (4) \u201cto reduce confusion as to which\n claims are on appeal.\u201d Id. at 72,271. The PTO first pub-\n lished the amendments as a notice of proposed rulemaking\n in the Federal Register on Nov. 15, 2010. Rules of Practice\n Before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in Ex\n Parte Appeals, 75 Fed. Reg. 69,828 (proposed Nov. 15,\n 2010). The final rules were published on Nov. 22, 2011.\n See 76 Fed. Reg. 72,270. The amendments apply to all ex\n parte appeals filed on or after January 23, 2012. Id. Odys-\n sey challenged the legality of these amendments, framing\n this Count as a \u201cfacial\u201d challenge to the 2011 amendments.\n See J.A. 31\u201332, 45.\n                              II\n     In the district court, the PTO moved to dismiss all\n three counts. It argued that the district court lacked sub-\n ject matter jurisdiction for the first two counts, and that\n the third count was barred by the statute of limitations.\n\fCase: 19-1066     Document: 47     Page: 6    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                      ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU\n\n\n\n\n Odyssey opposed the dismissal of Counts I and III. Odys-\n sey conceded that Count II should be dismissed but urged\n that it should be dismissed as moot under this Court\u2019s in-\n tervening decision in In re Durance, 891 F.3d 991 (Fed. Cir.\n 2018), rather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n See J.A. 1986.\n      The district court agreed with the PTO and dismissed\n all three counts. The court dismissed the first two counts\n because Odyssey was challenging actions not yet final be-\n fore the Board; the Board could provide Odyssey with an\n adequate remedy, and if not, Odyssey had statutory reme-\n dies for appeal under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141 or 145. The court\n held alternatively that it lacked a final agency action that\n would provide jurisdiction under \u00a7 704 of the APA. The\n court did not address mootness, noting that doing so would\n require it to \u201crule substantively on whether the recent de-\n cision in the Federal Circuit in the Durance case\u201d applied\n to Count II. J.A. 1996.\n      The district court dismissed Count III, holding that\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 barred the claims. J.A. 1997. The court\n held that Hire Order Ltd. v. Marianos, 698 F.3d 168, 170\n (4th Cir. 2012), requires the statute of limitations for a fa-\n cial APA challenge to run from the date the regulations\n were published. Because the amended ex parte appeal reg-\n ulations were published on November 22, 2011, and the\n complaint was filed on January 23, 2018 (six years after\n the effective date rather than the publication date), the\n statute of limitations had run. J.A. 1997. The district court\n held that, even if construed as an as-applied challenge, it\n lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the challenge\n because, without final agency action, the challenge could\n still be raised in the ongoing Board proceeding.\n     Odyssey timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47       Page: 7   Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU                       7\n\n\n\n                              III\n      We review procedural rules following \u201cthe rule of the\n regional circuit, unless the issue is unique to patent law\n and therefore exclusively assigned to the Federal Circuit.\u201d\n Madey v. Duke Univ., 307 F.3d 1351, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n APA claims against the PTO \u201craise[] a substantial question\n of patent law.\u201d Exela Pharma Scis., LLC v. Lee, 781 F.3d\n 1349, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2015). We \u201creview[] de novo the dis-\n trict court\u2019s dismissal of [a plaintiff\u2019s] APA claims against\n the PTO for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Pregis\n Corp. v. Kappos, 700 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012). As\n to procedural questions not relating to patent law, the\n Fourth Circuit \u201creview[s] the district court\u2019s grant of a mo-\n tion to dismiss de novo, focusing only on the legal suffi-\n ciency of the complaint.\u201d McCauley v. Home Loan Inv.\n Bank, F.S.B., 710 F.3d 551, 554 (4th Cir. 2013).\n                              A\n     We first address whether Odyssey satisfied the APA\u2019s\n finality requirement, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, for judicial review\n of Count I, Odyssey\u2019s challenge to the Examiner\u2019s Request\n for Rehearing in the \u2019678 appeal. On appeal, Odyssey ar-\n gues that the Board\u2019s reversal of the examiner\u2019s rejections\n in the \u2019678 appeal was a final agency action, and the re-\n hearing proceedings are an ultra vires action by the PTO.\n Odyssey characterizes the rehearing as a second Board pro-\n ceeding and urges us to consider the Board\u2019s rehearing as\n an \u201cattempted end-[run] around the inability of the PTO\u201d\n to directly appeal the Board\u2019s decision. Appellant\u2019s Br. 31.\n We disagree.\n     In the context of the APA, \u201can action is final if it both\n (1) mark[s] the consummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmak-\n ing process and (2) is one by which rights or obligations\n have been determined, or from which legal consequences\n will flow.\u201d Smith v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1765, 1775\u201376\n (2019) (internal quotations omitted) (first alteration in\n original). Until the Board issues its rehearing decision, the\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47     Page: 8    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                      ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU\n\n\n\n\n PTO has not consummated its decision-making process and\n Odyssey\u2019s rights and obligations in the \u2019678 patent have\n not been determined. Without such final action from the\n PTO, the APA does not entitle Odyssey to judicial review.\n      The rehearing process here is ordinary agency action\n in accordance with the PTO\u2019s Manual of Patent Examining\n Procedure. See M.P.E.P. 1214.04. 3 During a rehearing, the\n Board continues to consider the validity of an application\u2019s\n claims. Although it found the claims allowable during the\n \u2019678 application\u2019s appeal, the Board may reconsider its de-\n cision when the examiner requests rehearing. Id. See also\n In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526, 1531 (Fed. Cir. 1994), abro-\n gated on other grounds by In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943 (Fed.\n Cir. 2008) (allowing the Director to designate members of\n the Board to rehear a Board decision after the examiner\n requested rehearing under MPEP 1204.04); Application of\n Schmidt, 377 F.2d 639, 641 (C.C.P.A. 1967) (\u201cWhile re-\n quests for reconsideration by examiners are rare, it has\n been the settled practice to entertain them . . . .\u201d).

See id.\n\fCase: 19-1066     Document: 47     Page: 9    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU                        9\n\n\n\n reconsideration process is the last stop on the PTO\u2019s path\n to a final disposition, after which, if the Board does reverse\n itself, Odyssey will have an \u201cadequate remedy in court\u201d by\n appealing the Board\u2019s decision under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141 or\n 145. See 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.3(b)(1) (explaining that the appli-\n cant\u2019s time to challenge a Board decision in an appeal or\n civil action starts anew after the Board\u2019s action on rehear-\n ing); cf. Automated Merch. Sys., Inc. v. Lee, 782 F.3d 1376,\n 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (finding no final agency action in a\n suit challenging the PTO\u2019s refusal to terminate reexamina-\n tion proceedings despite the request of the patent owner).\n      In Odyssey\u2019s view, MPEP 1214.04 cannot apply be-\n cause the examiner\u2019s request for rehearing did not occur\n within 63 days, and, according to Odyssey, the Board loses\n jurisdiction 63 days after it issues its final decision, and\n these regulations must supersede PTO procedural guide-\n lines from the MPEP. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 15\u201317; (citing\n 37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 41.52, 41.35(b)(2)). See also 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.3\n (requiring than an applicant appeal a Board decision under\n \u00a7 141 or \u00a7 145 within 63 days). But neither \u00a7 41.52 nor\n \u00a7 41.35(b)(2) constrict the Patent Office\u2019s time to request\n rehearing; they instead bind the patent applicant. E.g., 37\n C.F.R. \u00a7 41.52(a)(1) (\u201cAppellant may file a single request\n for rehearing within two months of the date of the original\n decision of the Board.\u201d (emphasis added)). Instead, the reg-\n ulatory context suggests that the Director may override the\n Board\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d so long as he does not circumvent\n eventual Board review. See 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.35 (\u201cPrior to the\n entry of a decision on the appeal by the Board, the Director\n may sua sponte order the proceeding remanded to the ex-\n aminer.\u201d (internal cross-reference omitted)); Hyatt v. U.S.\n Pat. & Trademark Off., 904 F.3d 1361, 1375 (Fed. Cir.\n 2018) (\u201cAllowing examiners to reopen prosecution does not\n deprive applicants of their right to appeal final examiner\n rejections because reopening prosecution cannot circum-\n vent PTAB review.\u201d), cert. denied sub nom. Hyatt v. Iancu,\n 140 S. Ct. 45 (2019).\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47     Page: 10    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                     ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU\n\n\n\n\n     If the Director may divest the Board of its authority\n over an appeal so long as he does not circumvent the appli-\n cant\u2019s statutory right to appeal, the Director logically also\n may grant the Board authority to reconsider its appeal. Is-\n suing a request for rehearing under MPEP 1214.04 simply\n makes use of the Director\u2019s authority over the examination\n process under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 131, 132. See M.P.E.P. 1002.02\n (delegating the Director\u2019s authority to approve \u201c[r]equests\n from the examiner for . . . rehearing of a [Board] decision\u201d\n to the Deputy Commissioner for Patents).\n     In some circumstances, the PTO\u2019s delay in making a\n request for rehearing, although technically conforming\n with the statute and regulation, may cause unfair preju-\n dice to the applicant of such gravity that an applicant may\n seek otherwise-premature recourse in the courts. Hyatt,\n 904 F.3d at 1375 (\u201c[T]he APA offers a remedy for [abusive\n use of agency rules to delay proceedings] by enabling re-\n viewing courts to compel agency actions unlawfully with-\n held or unreasonably delayed without adequate reason or\n justification.\u201d) But nothing indicates that such abusive ac-\n tion took place here. If Odyssey did encounter any unfair\n prejudice, it may raise the issue after the Board has\n reached a final decision. And if Odyssey prevails before the\n Board, it can seek appropriate Patent Term Adjustment to\n compensate for any delay. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(b)(4).\n                              B\n     We next address whether Odyssey met the final agency\n action requirement for Count II, Odyssey\u2019s challenge to the\n PTO\u2019s dismissal of its petition \u2019603 application, or whether\n Count II should have been instead dismissed as moot under\n Durance. We affirm the district court\u2019s resolution of\n Count II. The dismissal of Odyssey\u2019s petition to designate\n new grounds is non-final agency action because the dismis-\n sal did not determine any rights or obligations or result in\n any legal consequences. Until the Board refuses to con-\n sider arguments made in Odyssey\u2019s reply brief for\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47     Page: 11    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU                      11\n\n\n\n exceeding the permissible scope of the brief under\n 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.41, the denial of Odyssey\u2019s petition to desig-\n nate new grounds has not determined any rights or re-\n sulted in any legal consequences. 4 The district court was\n therefore correct to dismiss Count II for lack of finality.\n      The district court was not obligated to dispose of the\n case on the more uncertain mootness ground\u2014or even con-\n sider it. \u201c[A] federal court has leeway to choose among\n threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the\n merits.\u201d Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l Shipping\n Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 431 (2007) (internal quotation marks\n omitted); see Long Term Care Partners, LLC v. United\n States, 516 F.3d 225, 233 (4th Cir. 2008) (upholding the dis-\n trict court\u2019s dismissal of a case on APA finality grounds\n without reaching a \u201cdifficult to resolve\u201d standing issue).\n The district court did not err by \u201ctak[ing] the less burden-\n some course.\u201d Sinochem, 549 U.S. at 436.\n                              C\n     Finally, we turn to whether the district court properly\n dismissed Odyssey\u2019s facial challenge to the PTO\u2019s 2011\n ex parte appeal amendments because the statute of limita-\n tions had run.

In that case, the appellants submitted a reply\n brief containing the arguments they wanted to make,\n waited for the final decision of the Board, requested rehear-\n ing, and only then turned to the courts for judicial review\n of the agency action.

IANCU\n\n\n\n\n under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 starts on the effective date of the\n regulations, not the published date. Odyssey urges us to\n ignore as dictum the Fourth Circuit\u2019s statement to the con-\n trary in Hire Order, 698 F.3d at 170, and to apply Premin-\n ger v. Sec\u2019y of Veterans Affairs, 517 F.3d 1299, 1307\n (Fed. Cir. 2008), which, in its view, suggests that the effec-\n tive date provides the correct rule. Appellant\u2019s Br. 35\u201336;\n Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 24\u201327. Odyssey argues that Hyatt,\n 904 F.3d at 1372, confirms this conclusion because it makes\n a substantive facial challenge to the rules\u2019 statutory com-\n pliance and therefore, under Hyatt, \u201cthe right of action ac-\n crued from the first adverse application of the amended\n rules against Odyssey, which could not have been any ear-\n lier than the effective date of the amended rules.\u201d Appel-\n lant\u2019s Br. 38. We disagree with Odyssey on all fronts.\n     The district court\u2019s decision is unquestionably correct\n under Hire Order. Odyssey characterized Count III as a\n facial challenge in its amended complaint, J.A. 45, and re-\n quested a remedy that would go beyond any applications of\n the contested rules to its appeals. J.A. 48. Odyssey does\n not retreat from that characterization before this Court.\n See Appellant\u2019s Br. 34, 38; Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 27. Under\n Hire Order, for \u201ca facial challenge to an agency ruling[,] . . .\n the limitations period begins to run when the agency pub-\n lishes the regulation.\u201d Hire Order, 698 F.3d at 170 (inter-\n nal quotation marks omitted). The challenged rules were\n published in the Federal Register on November 22, 2011;\n Odyssey filed its facial challenge on January 23, 2018,\n more than six years later. J.A. 1997. Count III is therefore\n barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401.\n     We need not decide whether this rule is a dictum, be-\n cause the other authority Odyssey cites leads to the same\n conclusion. Hyatt definitively sets out the rule applied by\n this Court, which accords with Hire Order for facial,\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47      Page: 13     Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU                        13\n\n\n\n substantive challenges like that raised here. 5 Under Hy-\n att, the statute of limitations for a challenge to the PTO\u2019s\n statutory authority to promulgate a regulation begins run-\n ning \u201ceither when the agency makes its initial decision or\n at the time of an adverse application of the decision against\n the plaintiff, whichever comes later.\u201d Hyatt, 904 F.3d at\n 1372. The nature of Odyssey\u2019s challenge, being a facial\n challenge, means that it does not assert any adverse appli-\n cations or seek relief in any specific applications. Cf. Educ.\n Media Co. at Va. Tech, Inc. v. Insley, 731 F.3d 291, 298 n.5\n (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A] court considering a facial challenge is\n to assess the constitutionality of the challenged law with-\n out regard to its impact on the plaintiff asserting the facial\n challenge. In contrast, an as-applied challenge is based on\n a developed factual record and the application of a statute\n to a specific person[.]\u201d (internal quotation marks and cita-\n tion omitted; second alteration original)).\n\n\n\n\n     5    Numerous courts of appeal have held similarly to\n Hire Order and Hyatt that the statute of limitations for a\n substantive facial challenge to a regulation runs from the\n date of publication. See Rodriguez v. United States, 852\n F.3d 67, 82 (1st Cir. 2017); Dunn\u2013McCampbell Royalty In-\n terest, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Park Serv., 112 F.3d 1283, 1287 (5th Cir.\n 1997); Wind River Min.

Ct. 2645 (2019).\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47      Page: 14   Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14                     ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v. IANCU\n\n\n\n\n      Without any adverse applications, the statute of limi-\n tations must accrue \u201cwhen the agency makes its initial de-\n cision.\u201d Hyatt, 904 F.3d at 1372. That decision is\n coterminous with the final agency action, which occurs\n when the agency promulgates the final regulation. See\n Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992) (\u201cThe\n core question [in determining whether an agency action is\n final] is whether the agency has completed its deci-\n sionmaking process, and whether the result of that process\n is one that will directly affect the parties.\u201d). In no case\n would the agency\u2019s \u201cinitial decision\u201d regarding a regulation\n take place on the effective date of the regulation.\n     Hyatt also forecloses Odyssey\u2019s arguments about Pre-\n minger. Hyatt explains that Preminger involved a proce-\n dural challenge, which alone distinguishes it from this\n case. Hyatt, 904 F.3d at 1372 (citing Preminger, 517 F.3d\n at 1307). In addition, Hyatt relies on Preminger for the rule\n that the relevant \u201cfinal agency action\u201d starting accrual of\n the statute of limitations for a procedural challenge is the\n promulgation of a regulation. Id. (citing Preminger,\n 517 F.3d at 1307).\n     Applying either Hire Order and Fourth Circuit law or\n Hyatt and Federal Circuit law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 bars Count\n III. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of\n Count III because the statute of limitations to challenge\n the ex parte appeal rules had run before Odyssey filed suit.\n                              IV\n     We have considered the parties\u2019 other arguments and\n find them unpersuasive. Odyssey brought its two chal-\n lenges to the PTO\u2019s actions during its ex parte appeals too\n early and brought its challenge to the PTO\u2019s ex parte appeal\n regulations too late. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the\n former two challenges for lack of subject matter jurisdic-\n tion and of the latter challenge for failure to state a claim\n is\n\fCase: 19-1066   Document: 47     Page: 15   Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v.

Odyssey challenges procedural actions taken\n by the PTO in two patent applications and makes a third\n facial challenge to certain PTO procedural rules governing\n practice before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in ex\n parte appeals. The Eastern District of Virginia dismissed\n the former two challenges for lack of subject matter juris-\n diction because the PTO had not taken final agency action.\n It dismissed the latter challenge as barred by 28 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2401, the six-year statute of limitations for challenges to\n agency action. Because we agree with the district court\n that the first two challenges concern non-final agency ac-\n tion and the latter challenge is barred by \u00a7 2401, we affirm.\n                               I\n     Odyssey Logistics and Technology Corporation (Odys-\n sey), disapproving of certain decisions of the PTO, chal-\n lenged the legality of those PTO decisions in district court\n under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The first\n challenge (Count I) relates to the prosecution of U.S. Pa-\n tent Application No. 11/005,678. The second challenge\n (Count II) relates to the prosecution of U.S. Patent Appli-\n cation No. 11/465,603.

Reg. 72,270\n (Nov. 22, 2011) (codified at 37 C.F.R. pts. 1 and 41). We\n recount the factual and procedural history of each chal-\n lenge in turn.\n                              A\n     Count I arises from the examination of Odyssey\u2019s\n \u2019678 patent application. Odyssey filed the \u2019678 application\n in 2004. After a number of procedural disputes over the\n examination of the application, including multiple appeals\n to this Court, see In re Riggs, 457 F. App\u2019x 923 (Fed. Cir.\n 2011); Odyssey Logistics & Tech. Corp. v. Kappos, No. 11-\n 1441 (Fed. Cir. filed June 20, 2011) (voluntarily dismissed),\n the Patent Trial and Appeal Board heard Odyssey\u2019s appeal\n of the examiner\u2019s rejections in the \u2019678 application. On\n April 29, 2016, the Board reversed the examiner\u2019s rejec-\n tions. J.A. 1225, 1229\u201330. The PTO did not, however, is-\n sue Odyssey a notice of allowance for the \u2019678 application.\n     Instead, on September 23, 2016, the Technology Center\n Director issued what Odyssey refers to as the \u201cexaminer\u2019s\n request for rehearing.\u201d 2 Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14; J.A. 1267.\n The rehearing request argued that the Board had applied\n\n\n     1   These rules refer to the Board of Patent Appeals\n and Interferences because they were promulgated before\n the America Invents Act replaced the BPAI with the Patent\n Trial and Appeal Board on September 16, 2012.

Because the relevant events\n here occurred after that date, we refer to the deciding ad-\n ministrative body as the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.\n     2   The PTO uses \u201crehearing\u201d to describe \u201creconsider-\n ation.\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.2.\n\fCase: 19-1066     Document: 47      Page: 4     Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                       ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v.

J.A. 1269\u201372. Odyssey was given the opportunity\n to respond to the rehearing request both before and after\n the Board received it. See J.A. 1282, 1371. On both occa-\n sions, Odyssey did not address the merits of the examiner\u2019s\n arguments, instead objecting to the procedural propriety of\n the rehearing request. See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Odyssey also </span><pre class=\"inline\">filed petitions\n objecting to the rehearing procedure, and requests for re-\n consideration when those petitions were dismissed. J.A.\n 1326, 1334, 1357, 1360, 1362. Odyssey eventually made\n some arguments on the merits \u201cunder protest,\u201d J.A. 1370,\n but instead of waiting for the Board\u2019s decision on these ar-\n guments, Odyssey filed this challenge to the request for re-\n hearing in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n                                B\n     Count II arises from the prosecution of Odyssey\u2019s \u2019603\n application. Odyssey filed the \u2019603 application in 2006. Af-\n ter a final rejection of all claims of the \u2019603 application, Od-\n yssey appealed the examiner\u2019s rejections and, at the same\n time, filed a petition demanding that the examiner make\n certain evidence part of the written record and supplement\n his responses to Odyssey\u2019s arguments with additional ex-\n planation. J.A. 1805, 1816; J.A. 1858. The examiner re-\n sponded, declining to include the additional evidence but\n further explaining his disagreement with Odyssey\u2019s argu-\n ments for allowance. Because the examiner had re-\n sponded, the Technology Center Director dismissed the\n petition as moot.\n     With this petition resolved, the examiner filed his an-\n swer to Odyssey\u2019s appeal brief. The examiner\u2019s answer did\n not designate any new grounds of rejection, see J.A. 1876,\n but Odyssey believed that the answer included new\n grounds, so Odyssey filed a new petition, requesting that\n the Technology Center Director designate certain portions\n\fCase: 19-1066    Document: 47      Page: 5    Filed: 05/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n ODYSSEY LOGISTICS AND TECH. v.

The Technology Center Director dismissed this peti-\n tion on the merits, finding that the portions of the answer\n with which Odyssey took issue did not set forth new\n grounds of rejection. J.A. 1910\u201313. Rather than filing a\n brief replying to the examiner\u2019s answer and waiting to see\n if the Board would strike certain portions of its reply as\n improper, Odyssey challenged the dismissal of the petition\n in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n                              C\n      Count III arises from the PTO\u2019s 2011 amendments to\n its rules of practice in ex parte appeals. See 76 Fed. Reg.\n 72,270. The PTO gave four purposes for these amend-\n ments: (1) \u201cto ensure that the Board has adequate infor-\n mation to decide ex parte appeals on the merits, while not\n unduly burdening appellants or examiners with unneces-\n sary briefing requirements\u201d; (2) \u201cto eliminate any gap in\n time from the end of briefing to the commencement of the\n Board\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d; (3) \u201cto clarify and simplify petitions\n practice on appeal\u201d; and (4) \u201cto reduce confusion as to which\n claims are on appeal.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 72,271. </span><pre class=\"inline\">The PTO first pub-\n lished the amendments as a notice of proposed rulemaking\n in the Federal Register on Nov. 15, 2010.

Cir.\n 2018), rather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n See J.A. 1986.\n      The district court agreed with the PTO and dismissed\n all three counts. The court dismissed the first two counts\n because Odyssey was challenging actions not yet final be-\n fore the Board; the Board could provide Odyssey with an\n adequate remedy, and if not, Odyssey had statutory reme-\n dies for appeal under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141 or 145. The court\n held alternatively that it lacked a final agency action that\n would provide jurisdiction under \u00a7 704 of the APA. The\n court did not address mootness, noting that doing so would\n require it to \u201crule substantively on whether the recent de-\n cision in the Federal Circuit in the Durance case\u201d applied\n to Count II. J.A. 1996.\n      The district court dismissed Count III, holding that\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 barred the claims. J.A. 1997. The court\n held that Hire Order Ltd. v.

Because the amended ex parte appeal reg-\n ulations were published on November 22, 2011, and the\n complaint was filed on January 23, 2018 (six years after\n the effective date rather than the publication date), the\n statute of limitations had run. J.A. 1997. The district court\n held that, even if construed as an as-applied challenge, it\n lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the challenge\n because, without final agency action, the challenge could\n still be raised in the ongoing Board proceeding.\n     Odyssey timely appealed.

Gen-\n erally, Invenergy determines what type of facility will be\n built, acquires the legal entitlements to construct that fa-\n cility, and ensures that the facility is properly constructed.\n Invenergy uses various subsidiaries to perform different\n functions in the creation task; relevant to this appeal are\n Invenergy Wind North America LLC (IWNA) and Inven-\n ergy Wind Development North America LLC (IWDNA). In-\n venergy also partly or wholly owns or controls, through\n various subsidiaries, some of the completed windfarms.\n California Ridge and Bishop Hill each own a namesake\n windfarm located in central Illinois. Each firm is con-\n trolled by Invenergy and owned through a partnership be-\n tween Invenergy and Firstar Development (USBank).\n     Development of the Bishop Hill windfarm began in\n 2005. Development of the California Ridge windfarm be-\n gan in 2008. Bishop Hill LLC and California Ridge Wind\n Energy LLC were formed on August 1, 2006, and Septem-\n ber 26, 2008, respectively.\n\fCase: 19-1463    Document: 58     Page: 4    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4           CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n      On July 18, 2011, years after development work began,\n Bishop Hill entered into a development agreement with\n IWNA. J.A. 14783. The agreement states that \u201cIWNA has\n provided development services to [Bishop Hill] to assist it\n in developing the Project,\u201d including \u201cnegotiating construc-\n tion financing terms, negotiating the project and opera-\n tional documents necessary or appropriate for the Project,\n obtaining permits and performing other services relating\n to the Project.\u201d Id. In exchange for those services, Bishop\n Hill was obligated to pay IWNA $60 million. Id. California\n Ridge entered a similar development agreement with\n IWDNA on February 29, 2012, also long after development\n of its windfarm began. J.A. 14780. The California Ridge\n agreement states that \u201cIWDNA has provided and hereby\n agrees to provide further development services\u201d identical\n to those listed in the Bishop Hill agreement. Id. In ex-\n change, California Ridge was obligated to pay IWDNA\n $50 million. Id.\n     Payment under the Bishop Hill agreement occurred on\n July 5, 2012\u2014involving a round trip of funds starting and\n ending with IWDNA. On that day, IWDNA transferred\n $60 million to Bishop Hill, which then wired $60 million to\n IWNA\u2014the entity owed the money under the agreement.\n The same day, IWNA wired $60 million to IWDNA.\n     Payment under the California Ridge agreement oc-\n curred on November 19, 2012\u2014also involving a round trip\n of funds starting and ending with IWDNA. On that day,\n IWDNA transferred $50 million to California Ridge, which\n then wired $50 million back to IWDNA\u2014the entity owed\n the money under the agreement.\n      On August 13, 2012, Bishop Hill applied to Treasury\n for a section 1603 grant totaling $129,923,109. To support\n its request, Bishop Hill submitted a breakdown of its direct\n and indirect costs. Bishop Hill included the $60 million de-\n velopment fee in the indirect costs of its windfarm and, of\n\fCase: 19-1463     Document: 58     Page: 5    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY    v. UNITED STATES             5\n\n\n\n that $60 million, allocated $56,956,837 to section-1603-\n qualified property. J.A. 1266.\n     On November 19, 2012, the same day that it paid\n IWDNA the development fee, California Ridge applied for\n a section 1603 grant totaling $136,858,980. To support its\n request, California Ridge submitted a cost breakdown sim-\n ilar to Bishop Hill\u2019s. Of the $50 million development fee,\n California Ridge allocated $49,315,067 to section-1603-\n qualified property. J.A. 1270.\n    On October 9, 2012, Treasury awarded Bishop Hill\n $117,216,098\u2014which was $12,707,011 less than the\n amount Bishop Hill sought. Treasury explained:\n     The amount requested was reduced because the\n     presented cost basis was higher than open market\n     expectations for projects of this size and in this lo-\n     cation and the transaction involved related parties\n     and/or related transactions. The cost basis has\n     been adjusted to allow for base costs plus an appro-\n     priate markup (to include reasonable overhead,\n     profit, and, if appropriate, development fees) re-\n     sulting in a total that more closely reflects the\n     amount that would have been paid in an arms\u2019\n     length transaction between parties with adverse\n     interests.\n J.A. 6525.\n      On December 5, 2012, Treasury awarded California\n Ridge $127,699,997\u2014which was $9,158,983 less than the\n amount California Ridge sought. Treasury\u2019s explanation\n for the reduction was identical to that given to Bishop Hill.\n J.A. 6523.\n    On March 28, 2014, California Ridge and Bishop Hill\n each filed a complaint against the United States in the\n Court of Federal Claims, alleging that Treasury had un-\n lawfully withheld payment mandated by section 1603.\n Each sought damages in the amount that Treasury had\n\fCase: 19-1463    Document: 58     Page: 6   Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6           CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n reduced its requested awards. The government counter-\n claimed, alleging the \u201cdevelopment fees\u201d specified in the\n two development agreements were not includable as eligi-\n ble costs given the circumstances and characteristics of\n those non-arm\u2019s-length agreements\u2014which the govern-\n ment characterized as \u201csham\u201d transactions. The govern-\n ment sought to recover the amounts of the awards\n attributable to the development fees\u2014$5,635,537 from Cal-\n ifornia Ridge and $4,380,039 from Bishop Hill.\n      The trial court ruled in favor of the government. The\n court determined that California Ridge and Bishop Hill\n failed to show that the development agreements had eco-\n nomic substance and concluded that the agreements were\n sham transactions. California Ridge, 143 Fed. Cl. at 761\u2013\n 62. The court determined that California Ridge\u2019s evi-\n dence\u2014in particular, the \u201cindependent certification\u201d of the\n development fees proffered by California Ridge and Bishop\n Hill\u2019s accounting firm, Deloitte; the development agree-\n ment \u201cwithout quantifiable services\u201d; and the \u201cround-trip\n wire transfer that began and ended in the same bank ac-\n count, on the same day\u201d\u2014fell \u201cwell short\u201d of showing that\n the development agreements were not shams and, more\n generally, that the development-fee amounts stated in\n those agreements were eligible costs. Id. at 762. Accord-\n ingly, the court dismissed California Ridge\u2019s and Bishop\n Hill\u2019s complaints and entered judgment for the government\n in the amounts it sought. Id. at 763; see J.A. 1\u20132.\n      California Ridge and Bishop Hill timely appealed, and\n we consolidated the appeals. We have appellate jurisdic-\n tion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). The Court of Federal\n Claims had jurisdiction over the claims under the Tucker\n Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1); as is undisputed, section 1603\n is a money-mandating statute. The trial court also had ju-\n risdiction over the overpayment-based counterclaims.\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 2508.\n\fCase: 19-1463     Document: 58        Page: 7   Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY       v. UNITED STATES          7\n\n\n\n                               II\n      On appeal, California Ridge 2 argues that the Court of\n Federal Claims failed to make sufficient findings of fact to\n allow this court to meaningfully review its decision, that\n the facts it did find are clearly erroneous, and that its con-\n clusion that the development agreements were sham trans-\n actions is a legal error. If those errors are corrected,\n California Ridge argues, it is entitled to the amount of the\n section 1603 grants disallowed by Treasury. California\n Ridge presents no separate challenge to the court\u2019s award\n if the development fee amounts were properly disregarded.\n     As the Court of Federal Claims concluded, and Califor-\n nia Ridge has not meaningfully disputed on appeal, it was\n California Ridge\u2019s burden to justify the amount of the de-\n velopment fee it claimed in support of the grant amount\n (30% of the eligible costs) it sought. See California Ridge,\n 143 Fed. Cl. at 760; see WestRock Virginia Corp. v. United\n States, 941 F.3d 1315, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (invoking for\n section 1603 the established burden rule for tax deduc-\n tions); cf. Alt. Carbon Resources, LLC v. United States, 939\n F.3d 1320, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2019); WMI Holdings Corp. v.\n United States, 891 F.3d 1016, 1021\u201322 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\n The trial court found that California Ridge had not carried\n that burden. Thus, the question before us is whether the\n Court of Federal Claims committed reversible error in so\n finding.\n      \u201cThe characterization of a transaction for tax purposes\n is a question of law that is subject to de novo review, while\n the underlying facts are reviewable for clear error.\u201d Salem\n Financial, Inc. v. United States, 786 F.3d 932, 940\n\n\n\n     2   On appeal, there is no material distinction between\n California Ridge and Bishop Hill. For simplicity we use\n \u201cCalifornia Ridge\u201d to refer to both parties, unless otherwise\n noted.\n\fCase: 19-1463     Document: 58      Page: 8   Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8           CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY     v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n (Fed. Cir. 2015). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when[,]\n although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing\n court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and\n firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d\n United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948).\n Whether the trial court made sufficient factual findings is\n reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Medtronic, Inc. v.\n Daig Corp., 789 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed. Cir. 1986).\n                              III\n     Section 1603 provides for government reimbursement\n to qualified applicants of a portion of the \u201cexpense\u201d of put-\n ting certain energy-generating property into service.\n Pub. L. No. 111-5, \u00a7 1603(a). That expense is measured by\n the \u201cbasis\u201d of such a property, id., \u00a7 1603(b)(1), and \u201cbasis\u201d\n is defined as \u201cthe cost of such property,\u201d 26 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1012(a). Accordingly, California Ridge, to support its\n claim, was required to prove that the dollar amounts of the\n development fees claimed\u2014stated in the development\n agreements and paid to IWNA and IWDNA out of IWDNA\u2019s\n own funds\u2014reliably measured the actual development\n costs for the windfarms.\n     We read the Court of Federal Claims opinion as finding\n that the amounts stated in the development agreements do\n not reliably indicate the development costs. That finding\n is not clearly erroneous. It is sufficiently supported by at\n least the round-trip nature of the payments; the absence in\n the agreements of any meaningful description of the devel-\n opment services to be provided; and the fact that all, or\n nearly all, of the development services had been completed\n by the time the agreements were executed.\n     California Ridge argues primarily that the develop-\n ment agreements had economic purpose and that, there-\n fore, the court\u2019s holding that those agreements were sham\n transactions was error. But that argument does not estab-\n lish that the trial court erred on the distinct question\n whether the dollar amounts of those agreements are a\n\fCase: 19-1463     Document: 58       Page: 9   Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY      v. UNITED STATES          9\n\n\n\n reliable indicator of the true development costs. Because\n we see no clear error in the trial court\u2019s finding on that is-\n sue, California Ridge cannot prevail regardless of whether\n additional proof would be needed to characterize the trans-\n actions as shams, an issue we need not address.\n                               A\n     Three aspects of the development agreements support\n the trial court\u2019s finding that the agreement-specified devel-\n opment fees do not reliably establish the actual develop-\n ment costs.\n      First, California Ridge paid the development fees with\n funds it obtained from another Invenergy subsidiary, re-\n sulting in a round-trip transaction in which the funds left\n from and returned to the same pocket on the same day. As\n noted by relevant Treasury guidance, \u201cin certain circum-\n stances, a taxpayer\u2019s stated cost for an asset does not re-\n flect the true economic cost of that asset to the taxpayer\n and will be ignored for purposes of determining the basis of\n the asset.\u201d U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, Evaluating Cost Ba-\n sis for Solar Photovoltaic Properties 1 (2011) (Cost Basis\n Guidance) (quoting Bryant v. Comm\u2019r, 790 F.2d 1463, 1466\n (9th Cir. 1986)). This may be the case when \u201ca transaction\n is not conducted at arm\u2019s-length by two economically self-\n interested parties or where a transaction is based upon pe-\n culiar circumstances.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted) (quot-\n ing Lemmen v. Comm\u2019r, 77 T.C. 1326, 1348 (1981)). Here,\n not only was the amount of the development fee negotiated\n between related entities, the fee was paid in a round-trip\n transaction such that neither the payor nor the payee was\n materially affected by the transaction. Such circumstances\n are \u201cpeculiar.\u201d And substantively, the trial court could rea-\n sonably view the agreed amount as not reliably indicating\n the actual value transferred, since the economic impact on\n payee or payor of the round-trip movement of money was,\n if not zero or negligible, wholly unrelated to the dollar fig-\n ures written into the agreements.\n\fCase: 19-1463      Document: 58    Page: 10     Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10             CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n      California Ridge contends that the characterization of\n the payments as nothing more than \u201cround-trip\u201d wire\n transfers ignores the complicated treatment featured in In-\n venergy\u2019s accounting books. As to the specific California\n Ridge development fee (as opposed to the Bishop Hill fee):\n there is evidence that payment was meant to be funded by\n Invenergy Wind Global\u2014yet another Invenergy entity\u2014\n but at the time that payment was due, IWDNA happened\n to be holding the money. J.A. 3387\u201388. Thus, California\n Ridge posits that moving the money directly from IWDNA\n to California Ridge was a transactional shortcut, which left\n out intermediate steps of moving money up one side of the\n Invenergy organizational chain and then back down an-\n other. J.A. 3314\u201315. But even if Invenergy intended for\n the money to come from the pocket of one Invenergy sub-\n sidiary and end in the pocket of another, both pockets still\n are Invenergy\u2019s. The trial court could readily find that the\n transaction, despite any characterization in Invenergy\u2019s ac-\n counting books, did not change the economic positions of\n IWDNA or California Ridge in anything like the amount\n stated in the agreement. See Frank Lyon Co. v. United\n States, 435 U.S. 561, 573 (1978) (\u201cThe Court has never re-\n garded the simple expedient of drawing up papers as con-\n trolling for tax purposes when the objective economic\n realities are to the contrary.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).\n As to the specific Bishop Hill fee: there is evidence that the\n initial payment from IWDNA to Bishop Hill was treated as\n a loan to IWNA, which IWNA paid back later that day after\n receiving payment from Bishop Hill, using the money\n IWDNA gave it. J.A. 3321\u201322. But even so characterized,\n the transaction did not change the economic position of any\n party in anything like the amount stated in the agreement.\n Therefore, Invenergy\u2019s accounting treatment does not un-\n dermine the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination that\n the development fees are not a reliable indicator of value.\n     Second, the development agreements lack any mean-\n ingful description of the services provided.     The\n\fCase: 19-1463    Document: 58     Page: 11    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES           11\n\n\n\n development agreements obligate Invenergy to perform\n only generic development services: \u201c[n]egotiat[e] construc-\n tion financing terms, negotiat[e] the project and opera-\n tional documents necessary or appropriate for the Project,\n obtain[] permits and perform[] other services relating to\n the Project.\u201d J.A. 14780, 14783. There is no concrete spec-\n ification of services that, if examined, might lend support\n to the amount set in the agreement for a premium on those\n services. And the choice to include only a highly generic\n description may reasonably be taken to suggest that the fee\n was not the result of a careful determination of what pre-\n mium was justified for the particular work done.\n     It is no answer to say, as California Ridge does, that\n there is extensive evidence that services were performed\n that come within the generic descriptions in the agree-\n ments. Development services certainly were provided to\n California Ridge. In its cost-breakdown submitted to\n Treasury, California Ridge described several categories of\n indirect costs separately included in the grant request,\n such as \u201cDevelopment legal,\u201d \u201cInternal Development,\u201d and\n \u201cMisc Site Development.\u201d J.A. 6530, 6569. And trial testi-\n mony provides some further details. See, e.g., J.A. 3288\u2013\n 89 (outside counsel work, for \u201cany number of development\n activities,\u201d including \u201czoning and permitting\u201d; payroll and\n travel costs for Invenergy\u2019s employees). But the generic\n character of the service description in the agreement\n makes it reasonable to find unproven the assertion that the\n fee amounts set in those agreements were a reliable indi-\n cator of the value of the development work.\n      Third, the development agreements were executed af-\n ter the development services were substantially completed.\n The Bishop Hill agreement states that Invenergy \u201chas pro-\n vided development services,\u201d J.A. 14783 (emphasis added),\n while the California Ridge agreement states that Inven-\n ergy \u201chas provided and hereby agrees to provide further\n development services,\u201d J.A. 14780 (emphasis added). Be-\n cause the services were already rendered, in full or in large\n\fCase: 19-1463      Document: 58    Page: 12     Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12             CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n part, the negotiated price for a premium as part of those\n services was not part of a pre-acquisition market transac-\n tion that would lend the price reliability as an indicator of\n market value.\n     The facts we have summarized provide a strong basis\n for the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination that Cali-\n fornia Ridge did not prove that the development fees stated\n in the agreements were reliable indicators of the develop-\n ment costs. And we see no clear error when we consider\n the foregoing facts together with California Ridge\u2019s addi-\n tional arguments, discussed next.\n                               B\n     California Ridge argues that the Court of Federal\n Claims erred because its sham-transaction determination\n effectively denies Invenergy the ability to transfer value to\n California Ridge by selling its services to California Ridge\n at fair market value. That contention is incorrect. In this\n case, the trial court could reasonably find, on the particular\n facts, that the agreement-stated figures do not accurately\n value eligible costs. That is hardly a general bar to\n properly valued transactions within the Invenergy family.\n     California Ridge also argues that the development\n agreements had economic substance because the economic\n position of third-party USBank was affected by the round-\n trip fee payments. But California Ridge forfeited this ar-\n gument by not raising it below. We may deem an argument\n forfeited when a party raises it for the first time on appeal.\n Personal Audio, LLC v. CBS Corp., 946 F.3d 1348, 1354\n (Fed. Cir. 2020); Sage Products, Inc. v. Devon Industries,\n Inc., 126 F.3d 1420, 1426 (Fed. Cir. 1997). California Ridge\n cites a portion of its closing statement to show that it raised\n the point to the trial court, Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. 15, but\n those statements were made to explain how USBank would\n be affected if the development fees were not included in the\n windfarms\u2019 bases, J.A. 3579\u201380. The cited statements do\n not show that California Ridge previously argued that the\n\fCase: 19-1463    Document: 58     Page: 13    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES           13\n\n\n\n payment of the development fees affected USBank. There-\n fore, California Ridge has forfeited the argument.\n      California Ridge further argues that the development\n agreements had economic substance because they created\n a positive net cash flow to Invenergy. The argument that\n there is some positive net cash flow to Invenergy does not\n undermine the essential finding on the only issue on ap-\n peal\u2014that the agreement-specified figures themselves\n were not proved to be accurate values for the costs at issue.\n Indeed, this argument is premised on faulty calculations.\n At trial, California Ridge\u2019s witness Mr. Murphy deter-\n mined the net cash flow to Invenergy by subtracting Inven-\n ergy\u2019s equity contribution to each windfarm from the\n respective development fee. J.A. 3016\u201326. In turn, Mr.\n Murphy determined Invenergy\u2019s equity contribution by\n subtracting the amount of third-party funding from the to-\n tal cost of the windfarm. J.A. 3019\u201322. When performing\n this calculation, however, Mr. Murphy used a total facility\n cost that included the cost of the development fee. Com-\n pare J.A. 3020 with J.A. 6568. The implication of Mr. Mur-\n phy\u2019s own testimony, it appears, is that the net cash to\n Invenergy is independent of the amount of the development\n fee. Such an implication undermines, rather than sup-\n ports, any inference that the amounts of the development\n fees are a reasonable indication of the development costs.\n       In addition, California Ridge argues that the independ-\n ent attestation of its accounting firm, Deloitte, shows that\n the development agreements have economic substance.\n But those attestations do not prove that the fees are a reli-\n able indication of cost. In its memo to California Ridge,\n Deloitte indicated that its examination was \u201cprimarily con-\n cerned with the potential errors of classification of assets\n as eligible property and determination of eligible basis\n . . . .\u201d J.A. 14690. Deloitte\u2019s examination of the develop-\n ment fees appears to have been focused on whether the de-\n velopment fees were allocable to grant-eligible costs. And\n it concluded that Invenergy\u2019s assertions that \u201cthe full\n\fCase: 19-1463      Document: 58    Page: 14     Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14             CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n amount of the development fee is capitalizable to the pro-\n ject assets and that the allocation to basis eligible for Sec-\n tion 1603 grants is appropriate\u201d were reasonable.\n J.A. 14701. Deloitte did not independently examine and\n determine whether the dollar amounts of the development\n fees accurately reflected the value of the premium on de-\n velopment work, as California Ridge claims. Although\n Deloitte stated that \u201cthe amount of the fee is consistent\n with the amounts paid by other third[-]party investors in\n other Invenergy projects,\u201d it did not aver that the amount\n of the fee was an accurate measure of cost in this particular\n circumstance. Id.\n      Lastly, California Ridge argues that the testimony of\n its expert Mr. Gross shows that the development fees are\n reliable measures of the value Invenergy provided to the\n windfarms. In particular, California Ridge argues that Mr.\n Gross\u2019s testimony shows that the amount of the fees was\n within the range of \u201cappropriate markups\u201d identified by\n Treasury in certain published guidance. That guidance de-\n scribes three approaches to determining the appropriate\n costs basis for purposes of section 1603. Cost Basis Guid-\n ance, at 3\u20134. Under the \u201ccost approach,\u201d an applicant\n \u201cshould clearly show the cost buildup, including hard costs,\n soft costs, and profit.\u201d Id. at 4. The guidance further pro-\n vides that an applicant may include a \u201cmarkup\u201d in its cost\n basis and that \u201cappropriate markups typically fall in the\n range of 10 to 20 percent.\u201d Id. California Ridge argues that\n the amounts of the development fees fall in that range,\n when measured as a percent of the other grant-eligible\n costs. But California Ridge has not established that this is\n an appropriate reading of the guidance, which specifies\n that markups are appropriate only when they are con-\n sistent with the \u201cscope of the work for which the markup is\n received.\u201d Id. That language suggests using a percentage\n of the cost of the development work provided, rather than\n of all grant-eligible costs. And, as discussed above, the ser-\n vices in the development agreements are described so\n\fCase: 19-1463    Document: 58     Page: 15    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES          15\n\n\n\n generically as to make it difficult to determine what spe-\n cific work the development-fee \u201cmarkups\u201d are tethered to.\n Therefore, Mr. Gross\u2019s testimony that the amounts of the\n development fees comply with Treasury\u2019s guidance does\n not establish clear error on the trial court\u2019s behalf.\n     We need not decide whether Mr. Gross\u2019s testimony\u2014\n regarding the cost approach or the other approaches for de-\n termining basis\u2014might have supported a finding in Cali-\n fornia Ridge\u2019s favor regarding the development fees. The\n question on appeal is whether we are left with a definite\n and firm conviction that the trial court erred in finding to\n the contrary. We are not.\n                             IV\n     California Ridge argues that the Court of Federal\n Claims clearly erred in two findings of fact.\n     First, it disputes the trial court\u2019s finding that Mr.\n Schueler \u201cdid not give testimony specific[ally] related to\n the development services outlined in the three-page devel-\n opment agreement[s].\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 18 (quoting Califor-\n nia Ridge, 143 Fed. Cl. at 761). We conclude, however, that\n the court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous in light of the\n record. The court noted that Mr. Schueler testified that he\n was \u201cnot immediately familiar\u201d with the development\n agreements. California Ridge, 143 Fed. Cl. at 761 (citing\n J.A. 2911). California Ridge cites many portions of Mr.\n Schueler\u2019s testimony as purportedly showing the extensive\n development work that he and his team did at the wind-\n farms. Appellants\u2019 Br. 18\u201319. But much of that testimony\n is about the type of development work that Mr. Schueler\n did for Invenergy windfarms generally, see, e.g., J.A. 2805\u2013\n 06, 2815\u201317, and the rest of his testimony, while focused\n on development work done at the Bishop Hill or California\n Ridge windfarms, does not indicate any relation between\n the work done and the development agreements, see, e.g.,\n J.A. 2837\u201339, 2849\u201360. Additionally, the documents that\n California Ridge cites as evidence of the development work\n\fCase: 19-1463      Document: 58   Page: 16      Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16             CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n done are all dated earlier than the relevant development\n agreement, see, e.g., J.A. 12982\u201392 (dated May 3, 2011),\n J.A. 13034\u201335 (dated June 20, 2011); thus, these docu-\n ments do not show that the work documented was specifi-\n cally related to the services outlined in the development\n agreements. Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 find-\n ing that Mr. Schueler did not give testimony specifically\n related to the development agreements is not clear error.\n     Second, California Ridge challenges the court\u2019s finding\n that the developers did not quantify the services provided\n under the agreements. Appellants\u2019 Br. 22\u201323 (citing Cali-\n fornia Ridge, 143 Fed. Cl. at 762). California Ridge argues\n that the services to be provided were clearly defined, it was\n possible to objectively verify whether the services were per-\n formed, and the services were quantified by the $50- and\n $60-million development fees. We understand the chal-\n lenged trial-court finding, however, as meaning that Cali-\n fornia Ridge failed to provide any specificity as to what,\n concretely, was done under the development agreements\n that would warrant the development-fee premiums in the\n amounts stated in the agreements. So understood, the\n finding is not clearly erroneous.\n     As discussed above, the development agreements obli-\n gate Invenergy to perform development services identified\n only at a very high level of generality. And California\n Ridge\u2019s provided method for determining whether those\n tasks have been completed is equivalent to a determination\n that the project has been completed. Such a determination\n does not show that the development agreements were in-\n dependently valuable and necessary when there are many\n other costs\u2014all necessary to the completion of the pro-\n jects\u2014also accounted for in California Ridge\u2019s evidence.\n Lastly, although California Ridge did provide evidence as\n to how it arrived at the $50- and $60-million figures, see\n J.A. 2964\u201378, that evidence does not show that the valua-\n tions were reliable. Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims\n did not clearly err when it found that the development\n\fCase: 19-1463    Document: 58      Page: 17    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY     v.

UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n      California Ridge contends that the characterization of\n the payments as nothing more than \u201cround-trip\u201d wire\n transfers ignores the complicated treatment featured in In-\n venergy\u2019s accounting books. As to the specific California\n Ridge development fee (as opposed to the Bishop Hill fee):\n there is evidence that payment was meant to be funded by\n Invenergy Wind Global\u2014yet another Invenergy entity\u2014\n but at the time that payment was due, IWDNA happened\n to be holding the money. J.A. 3387\u201388. Thus, California\n Ridge posits that moving the money directly from IWDNA\n to California Ridge was a transactional shortcut, which left\n out intermediate steps of moving money up one side of the\n Invenergy organizational chain and then back down an-\n other. J.A. 3314\u201315. But even if Invenergy intended for\n the money to come from the pocket of one Invenergy sub-\n sidiary and end in the pocket of another, both pockets still\n are Invenergy\u2019s. The trial court could readily find that the\n transaction, despite any characterization in Invenergy\u2019s ac-\n counting books, did not change the economic positions of\n IWDNA or California Ridge in anything like the amount\n stated in the agreement. See Frank Lyon Co. v. United\n States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109829\"><a href=\"/opinion/109829/frank-lyon-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (1978) (\u201cThe Court has never re-\n garded the simple expedient of drawing up papers as con-\n trolling for tax purposes when the objective economic\n realities are to the contrary.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).\n As to the specific Bishop Hill fee: there is evidence that the\n initial payment from IWDNA to Bishop Hill was treated as\n a loan to IWNA, which IWNA paid back later that day after\n receiving payment from Bishop Hill, using the money\n IWDNA gave it. J.A. 3321\u201322. But even so characterized,\n the transaction did not change the economic position of any\n party in anything like the amount stated in the agreement.\n Therefore, Invenergy\u2019s accounting treatment does not un-\n dermine the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination that\n the development fees are not a reliable indicator of value.\n     Second, the development agreements lack any mean-\n ingful description of the services provided.

There is no concrete spec-\n ification of services that, if examined, might lend support\n to the amount set in the agreement for a premium on those\n services. And the choice to include only a highly generic\n description may reasonably be taken to suggest that the fee\n was not the result of a careful determination of what pre-\n mium was justified for the particular work done.\n     It is no answer to say, as California Ridge does, that\n there is extensive evidence that services were performed\n that come within the generic descriptions in the agree-\n ments. Development services certainly were provided to\n California Ridge. In its cost-breakdown submitted to\n Treasury, California Ridge described several categories of\n indirect costs separately included in the grant request,\n such as \u201cDevelopment legal,\u201d \u201cInternal Development,\u201d and\n \u201cMisc Site Development.\u201d J.A. 6530, 6569. And trial testi-\n mony provides some further details.

But the generic\n character of the service description in the agreement\n makes it reasonable to find unproven the assertion that the\n fee amounts set in those agreements were a reliable indi-\n cator of the value of the development work.\n      Third, the development agreements were executed af-\n ter the development services were substantially completed.\n The Bishop Hill agreement states that Invenergy \u201chas pro-\n vided development services,\u201d J.A. 14783 (emphasis added),\n while the California Ridge agreement states that Inven-\n ergy \u201chas provided and hereby agrees to provide further\n development services,\u201d J.A. 14780 (emphasis added). Be-\n cause the services were already rendered, in full or in large\n\fCase: 19-1463      Document: 58    Page: 12     Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12             CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n part, the negotiated price for a premium as part of those\n services was not part of a pre-acquisition market transac-\n tion that would lend the price reliability as an indicator of\n market value.\n     The facts we have summarized provide a strong basis\n for the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination that Cali-\n fornia Ridge did not prove that the development fees stated\n in the agreements were reliable indicators of the develop-\n ment costs. And we see no clear error when we consider\n the foregoing facts together with California Ridge\u2019s addi-\n tional arguments, discussed next.\n                               B\n     California Ridge argues that the Court of Federal\n Claims erred because its sham-transaction determination\n effectively denies Invenergy the ability to transfer value to\n California Ridge by selling its services to California Ridge\n at fair market value. That contention is incorrect. In this\n case, the trial court could reasonably find, on the particular\n facts, that the agreement-stated figures do not accurately\n value eligible costs. That is hardly a general bar to\n properly valued transactions within the Invenergy family.\n     California Ridge also argues that the development\n agreements had economic substance because the economic\n position of third-party USBank was affected by the round-\n trip fee payments. But California Ridge forfeited this ar-\n gument by not raising it below. We may deem an argument\n forfeited when a party raises it for the first time on appeal.\n Personal Audio, LLC v.

There-\n fore, California Ridge has forfeited the argument.\n      California Ridge further argues that the development\n agreements had economic substance because they created\n a positive net cash flow to Invenergy. The argument that\n there is some positive net cash flow to Invenergy does not\n undermine the essential finding on the only issue on ap-\n peal\u2014that the agreement-specified figures themselves\n were not proved to be accurate values for the costs at issue.\n Indeed, this argument is premised on faulty calculations.\n At trial, California Ridge\u2019s witness Mr. Murphy deter-\n mined the net cash flow to Invenergy by subtracting Inven-\n ergy\u2019s equity contribution to each windfarm from the\n respective development fee. J.A. 3016\u201326. In turn, Mr.\n Murphy determined Invenergy\u2019s equity contribution by\n subtracting the amount of third-party funding from the to-\n tal cost of the windfarm. J.A. 3019\u201322. When performing\n this calculation, however, Mr. Murphy used a total facility\n cost that included the cost of the development fee. Com-\n pare J.A. 3020 with J.A. 6568. The implication of Mr. Mur-\n phy\u2019s own testimony, it appears, is that the net cash to\n Invenergy is independent of the amount of the development\n fee. Such an implication undermines, rather than sup-\n ports, any inference that the amounts of the development\n fees are a reasonable indication of the development costs.\n       In addition, California Ridge argues that the independ-\n ent attestation of its accounting firm, Deloitte, shows that\n the development agreements have economic substance.\n But those attestations do not prove that the fees are a reli-\n able indication of cost. In its memo to California Ridge,\n Deloitte indicated that its examination was \u201cprimarily con-\n cerned with the potential errors of classification of assets\n as eligible property and determination of eligible basis\n . . . .\u201d J.A. 14690. Deloitte\u2019s examination of the develop-\n ment fees appears to have been focused on whether the de-\n velopment fees were allocable to grant-eligible costs.

UNITED STATES          15\n\n\n\n generically as to make it difficult to determine what spe-\n cific work the development-fee \u201cmarkups\u201d are tethered to.\n Therefore, Mr. Gross\u2019s testimony that the amounts of the\n development fees comply with Treasury\u2019s guidance does\n not establish clear error on the trial court\u2019s behalf.\n     We need not decide whether Mr. Gross\u2019s testimony\u2014\n regarding the cost approach or the other approaches for de-\n termining basis\u2014might have supported a finding in Cali-\n fornia Ridge\u2019s favor regarding the development fees. The\n question on appeal is whether we are left with a definite\n and firm conviction that the trial court erred in finding to\n the contrary. We are not.\n                             IV\n     California Ridge argues that the Court of Federal\n Claims clearly erred in two findings of fact.\n     First, it disputes the trial court\u2019s finding that Mr.\n Schueler \u201cdid not give testimony specific[ally] related to\n the development services outlined in the three-page devel-\n opment agreement[s].\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 18 (quoting Califor-\n nia </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ridge,</span> <span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> at <span class=\"page\">761</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">). We conclude, however, that\n the court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous in light of the\n record. The court noted that Mr. Schueler testified that he\n was \u201cnot immediately familiar\u201d with the development\n agreements. California </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ridge,</span> <span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> at <span class=\"page\">761</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(citing\n J.A. 2911). California Ridge cites many portions of Mr.\n Schueler\u2019s testimony as purportedly showing the extensive\n development work that he and his team did at the wind-\n farms. Appellants\u2019 Br. 18\u201319. But much of that testimony\n is about the type of development work that Mr. Schueler\n did for Invenergy windfarms generally, see, e.g., J.A. 2805\u2013\n 06, 2815\u201317, and the rest of his testimony, while focused\n on development work done at the Bishop Hill or California\n Ridge windfarms, does not indicate any relation between\n the work done and the development agreements, see, e.g.,\n J.A. 2837\u201339, 2849\u201360. Additionally, the documents that\n California Ridge cites as evidence of the development work\n\fCase: 19-1463      Document: 58   Page: 16      Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16             CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n done are all dated earlier than the relevant development\n agreement, see, e.g., J.A. 12982\u201392 (dated May 3, 2011),\n J.A. 13034\u201335 (dated June 20, 2011); thus, these docu-\n ments do not show that the work documented was specifi-\n cally related to the services outlined in the development\n agreements. Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 find-\n ing that Mr. Schueler did not give testimony specifically\n related to the development agreements is not clear error.\n     Second, California Ridge challenges the court\u2019s finding\n that the developers did not quantify the services provided\n under the agreements. Appellants\u2019 Br. 22\u201323 (citing Cali-\n fornia </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ridge,</span> <span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> at <span class=\"page\">762</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">). California Ridge argues\n that the services to be provided were clearly defined, it was\n possible to objectively verify whether the services were per-\n formed, and the services were quantified by the $50- and\n $60-million development fees. We understand the chal-\n lenged trial-court finding, however, as meaning that Cali-\n fornia Ridge failed to provide any specificity as to what,\n concretely, was done under the development agreements\n that would warrant the development-fee premiums in the\n amounts stated in the agreements. So understood, the\n finding is not clearly erroneous.\n     As discussed above, the development agreements obli-\n gate Invenergy to perform development services identified\n only at a very high level of generality. And California\n Ridge\u2019s provided method for determining whether those\n tasks have been completed is equivalent to a determination\n that the project has been completed. Such a determination\n does not show that the development agreements were in-\n dependently valuable and necessary when there are many\n other costs\u2014all necessary to the completion of the pro-\n jects\u2014also accounted for in California Ridge\u2019s evidence.\n Lastly, although California Ridge did provide evidence as\n to how it arrived at the $50- and $60-million figures, see\n J.A. 2964\u201378, that evidence does not show that the valua-\n tions were reliable. Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims\n did not clearly err when it found that the development\n\fCase: 19-1463    Document: 58      Page: 17    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n CALIFORNIA RIDGE WIND ENERGY     v.

MSPB\n\n\n\n PER CURIAM.\n     Mitch Wine petitions for review of the Merit Systems\n Protection Board\u2019s dismissal of his individual right of ac-\n tion appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Because Mr. Wine did\n not make non-frivolous allegations of a \u201cpersonnel action\u201d\n taken against him, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision.\n                              I\n      The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) em-\n ployed Mr. Wine from 2003 to 2018. In February 2016, Mr.\n Wine filed a complaint (MA-16-2281) with the Office of Spe-\n cial Counsel (OSC), alleging that FWS supervisors retali-\n ated against him for making certain protected disclosures.\n In July 2016, OSC informed Mr. Wine that it had termi-\n nated its investigation of these allegations, and Mr. Wine\n filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the\n Board. See Wine v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, No. DA-1221-16-\n 0513-W-2, 2017 MSPB LEXIS 5121 at *13 (M.S.P.B. De-\n cember 5, 2017) (2017 IRA Decision).\n     In the fall of 2016, Mr. Wine filed a second OSC com-\n plaint (MA-17-0509, \u201cFall 2016 complaint\u201d) detailing addi-\n tional disclosures. See id. at *14. Mr. Wine\u2019s designated\n representative requested those claims be added to the\n pending IRA appeal, so OSC terminated its investigation\n in March 2017. See Wine v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, No. DA-\n 0752-18-0116-S-7, 2019 MSPB LEXIS 1869 at *3\u20134\n (M.S.P.B. May 31, 2019) (finding that OSC had closed the\n 2016 complaint, exhausting those issues, and that an IRA\n appeal based on that complaint would be untimely). The\n Board appears to have partly considered that second com-\n plaint in Mr. Wine\u2019s IRA appeal, but found certain allega-\n tions not exhausted before OSC. 2017 IRA Decision\n at *18\u201319, *20 n.2, *43 n.6, *51 n.9, *92 n.12. Ultimately,\n the Board denied Mr. Wine\u2019s request for corrective action\n because it found that FWS would have taken the same ac-\n tions absent his whistleblowing.

Mr. Wine eventually entered into a\n settlement agreement with FWS, which the Board ap-\n proved as the final resolution of the appeal in April 2018.\n Wine v.

April 30, 2018).\n     In January 2018, while that appeal was pending, Mr.\n Wine contacted OSC seeking \u201creconsideration\u201d of his Fall\n 2016 (MA-17-0509) complaint. S.A. 44. 1 Mr. Wine believed\n this was necessary to cure his failure to exhaust allegations\n in his original IRA appeal. Id. OSC purportedly agreed to\n reevaluate the complaint, but Mr. Wine, dissatisfied with\n a perceived lack of follow-up or action, in June 2019, filed\n the IRA appeal petitioned here. Id. See Wine v. Office of\n Special Counsel, No. DA-1221-19-0363-W-1, 2019 MSPB\n LEXIS 2747 (M.S.P.B. July 29, 2019) (Decision). He alleges\n that OSC retaliated against him in violation of 5 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2302 by failing to complete an investigation of the Fall\n 2016 complaint and by failing to \u201creconsider\u201d that com-\n plaint in 2018. S.A. 44.\n                              II\n      In the petitioned IRA appeal, OSC moved for a juris-\n dictional determination, arguing that the Board lacked ju-\n risdiction because Mr. Wine \u201cfailed to nonfrivolously allege:\n (1) that OSC subjected him to an appealable action; or\n (2) that OSC subjected him to a covered personnel action in\n retaliation for his protected whistleblowing activity.\u201d De-\n cision at *2\u20133. The Administrative Judge ordered Mr.\n Wine to show cause why the IRA appeal should not be dis-\n missed for lack of jurisdiction, directing Mr. Wine to ex-\n plain in particular how \u201cOSC\u2019s investigations or\n\n\n\n\n     1  \u201cS.A.\u201d refers to the pages of the respondent\u2019s sup-\n plemental appendix attached to the respondent\u2019s brief.\n\fCase: 20-1006    Document: 35      Page: 4   Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                              WINE   v. MSPB\n\n\n\n prosecutorial decisions were personnel actions within the\n meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A).\u201d Decision at *3.\n      Mr. Wine argued that OSC\u2019s failure to investigate qual-\n ified as a personnel action under \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii) be-\n cause it \u201ceffectuated a \u2018significant change in working\n conditions\u2019 for [Mr. Wine] by allowing FWS managers to\n dismiss harassment grievances against themselves and in-\n terfere with [Mr. Wine\u2019s] Workers\u2019 Compensation claim to\n have it denied unlawfully.\u201d Decision at *4 (quoting S.A. 45,\n itself quoting \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii)). Mr. Wine argued that\n OSC\u2019s actions were a prohibited personnel practice in vio-\n lation of \u00a7 2302(b)(12) because, in his view, OSC had an ob-\n ligation to investigate his claims under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a),\n and not doing so would violate his due process rights. De-\n cision at *4\u20135.\n     The Administrative Judge rejected these arguments,\n holding that the Board has no authority to enforce OSC\u2019s\n statutory requirements to investigate allegations of whis-\n tleblower reprisal.

The Administrative Judge explained that \u201c[OSC\u2019s]\n investigations and decisions are not personnel actions\n within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A), even\n though they may be of interest to [Mr. Wine] and to his ca-\n reer with FWS.\u201d Decision at *6.\n     Mr. Wine did not petition for appeal to the full Board.\n The Administrative Judge\u2019s initial decision became the\n Board\u2019s final decision and Mr. Wine timely petitioned this\n Court for review.

To establish the\n Board\u2019s jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, petitioners must\n identify non-frivolous allegations that (1) they engaged in\n whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure\n under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2302(b)(8), (b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D);\n and (2) the protected disclosure was a contributing factor\n in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take a personnel\n action as defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a). Id. at 1379\u201380; see\n 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(a). \u201c[N]ot every agency action is a \u2018person-\n nel action\u2019 under the WPA.\u201d King v.

See S.A. 45. To es-\n tablish a personnel action under this provision, Mr. Wine\n would have to identify a \u201csignificant change in duties, re-\n sponsibilities, or working conditions\u201d caused by OSC\u2019s al-\n legedly improper inaction.       \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).  The\n circumstances here preclude any reasonable allegation\n\fCase: 20-1006     Document: 35      Page: 6    Filed: 05/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                                WINE   v. MSPB\n\n\n\n that OSC\u2019s failure to investigate created a \u201csignificant\n change\u201d in Mr. Wine\u2019s working conditions. Because Mr.\n Wine did not work for OSC, OSC had no direct authority to\n change Mr. Wine\u2019s working conditions. Claims that OSC\u2019s\n actions can cause a \u201csignificant change\u201d in Mr. Wine\u2019s\n working conditions\u2014when he was employed by FWS, not\n OSC\u2014rest on a dubious foundation.\n     Moreover, OSC\u2019s alleged failure to investigate logically\n cannot have changed Mr. Wine\u2019s working conditions. Any\n hostile working conditions Mr. Wine experienced at FWS\n must have existed before he even complained to OSC, else\n he would have had no grounds for a complaint. Thus, ei-\n ther OSC has not yet been given adequate notice of\n Mr. Wine\u2019s allegations, or any failure to act by OSC only\n maintained the status quo. OSC\u2019s hypothetical ability to\n improve the status quo by investigating Mr. Wine\u2019s allega-\n tions and recommending corrective action does not give the\n Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal involving OSC. Cf.\n Wren v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 681 F.2d 867, 871\u201372 (D.C.\n Cir. 1982) (holding that the Board has no authority to en-\n force OSC\u2019s statutory requirement to investigate whistle-\n blower reprisals).\n     The Whistleblower Protection Act offers Mr. Wine the\n opportunity to resolve any allegations he believes were not\n adequately investigated by OSC through filing an IRA ap-\n peal directed to FWS\u2019s actions.

In February 2016, Mr.\n Wine filed a complaint (MA-16-2281) with the Office of Spe-\n cial Counsel (OSC), alleging that FWS supervisors retali-\n ated against him for making certain protected disclosures.\n In July 2016, OSC informed Mr. Wine that it had termi-\n nated its investigation of these allegations, and Mr. Wine\n filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the\n Board. See Wine v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, No. DA-1221-16-\n 0513-W-2, 2017 MSPB LEXIS 5121 at *13 (M.S.P.B.

See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at *14. </span><pre class=\"inline\">Mr. Wine\u2019s designated\n representative requested those claims be added to the\n pending IRA appeal, so OSC terminated its investigation\n in March 2017.

He alleges\n that OSC retaliated against him in violation of 5 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2302 by failing to complete an investigation of the Fall\n 2016 complaint and by failing to \u201creconsider\u201d that com-\n plaint in 2018.

Mr. Wine argued that\n OSC\u2019s actions were a prohibited personnel practice in vio-\n lation of \u00a7 2302(b)(12) because, in his view, OSC had an ob-\n ligation to investigate his claims under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a),\n and not doing so would violate his due process rights.

The district court held the claims invalid for ineli-\n gibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, but we reversed that holding\n in McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games America Inc., 837\n F.3d 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (McRO I). On remand, the dis-\n trict court ultimately held that the Developers were enti-\n tled to summary judgment of noninfringement because the\n accused products do not practice the claimed methods and\n to summary judgment of invalidity because the specifica-\n tion fails to enable the full scope of the claims.\n     McRO appeals. We affirm the judgment of noninfringe-\n ment. We vacate the judgment of invalidity and remand\n for the district court to consider any appropriate further\n proceedings in light of, among other things, the Developers\u2019\n offer to withdraw their counterclaims without prejudice.\n See ECF No. 86.\n                               I\n                              A\n      McRO owns U.S. Patent No. 6,611,278, which describes\n and claims a method for automatically generating anima-\n tions, with a three-dimensional appearance, depicting lip\n movements and facial expressions. The method uses two\n basic building blocks: \u201cphonemes\u201d and \u201cmorph targets.\u201d A\n \u201cphoneme,\u201d the patent explains, is \u201cthe smallest unit of\n speech, and corresponds to a single sound.\u201d \u2019278 patent,\n col. 1, lines 38\u201340. A \u201cmorph target\u201d is a model of a mouth\n position\u2014one \u201creference model\u201d displays a \u201cneutral mouth\n position,\u201d while other models display \u201cother mouth posi-\n tions, each corresponding to a different phoneme or set of\n phonemes.\u201d Id., col. 1, lines 48\u201353.\n     The patent describes specifying a model by identifying\n groups of vertices placed in particular positions. In a \u201ctyp-\n ical case,\u201d \u201c[e]ach morph target has the same topology as\n the neutral model, the same number of vertices, and each\n vertex on each model logically corresponds to a vertex on\n\fCase: 19-1557      Document: 88      Page: 4    Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                 MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA\n\n\n\n each other model.\u201d Id., col. 1, lines 54\u201359. Because of that\n precise correspondence, each morph target can be defined\n as a set of \u201cdeltas,\u201d each delta a vertex-specific vector: there\n is a \u201cvector from each vertex n on the reference to each ver-\n tex n on each morph target,\u201d and that vector is the \u201cdelta\u201d\n for that vertex. Id., col. 1, lines 60\u201363.\n     To animate a particular facial expression, an artist de-\n fines a plurality of morph targets (with corresponding delta\n sets) and assigns a scalar \u201cmorph weight\u201d\u2014\u201ca value usu-\n ally from 0 to 1\u201d\u2014to each target. Id., col. 1, lines 65\u201367.\n Next, the artist chooses a vertex on the reference model\n and adds the \u201ccorresponding delta set\u2019s vertex multiplied\n by the scalar morph weight.\u201d Id., col. 2, lines 1\u20133. Repeat-\n ing this vertex-specific process for each morph target being\n used to create the desired animation, the artist sums the\n resulting vectors and proceeds to the next reference-model\n vertex. See id., col. 2, lines 4\u20135. The specification summa-\n rizes this process with a formula, stating that for \u201ceach ver-\n tex v in the neutral model\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n J.A. 15 (cleaning up \u2019278 patent, col. 2, line 6). 1\n\n\n\n     1    In the sigma (summation) term of the formula,\n there are n morph targets (x = 1 through n) that contribute\n to the ultimate result. For each morph target x, its delta (a\n vector) for the chosen vertex\u2014i.e., the particular vertex\u2019s\n vector within |delta setx|\u2014is multiplied by the scalar\n morph weight for that morph target. The n resulting vec-\n tors (for x = 1 through n) are added in the ordinary way for\n vectors, i.e., term by term in the ordered-sequence repre-\n sentation. Then the sum, in its ordered-sequence represen-\n tation, is added to the ordered-sequence representation of\n the corresponding vertex of the neutral model.\n\fCase: 19-1557      Document: 88     Page: 5     Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA                    5\n\n\n\n      Although prior-art methods used morph weight sets,\n the patent asserts, artists using those methods had to \u201cset\n all of these weights at each frame to an appropriate value.\u201d\n \u2019278 patent, col. 2, lines 26\u201327. Accordingly, those methods\n were time-consuming and laborious, and artists therefore\n sought to reduce the required work with a \u201c\u2018keyframe\u2019 ap-\n proach, where the artist [would] set[] the appropriate\n weights at certain important times (\u2018keyframes\u2019) and a pro-\n gram [would] interpolate[] each of the channels at each\n frame.\u201d Id., col. 2, lines 28\u201331. But the keyframe approach\n itself was \u201cvery tedious and time consuming, as well as in-\n accurate.\u201d Id., col. 2, lines 31\u201334.\n      By contrast, the \u2019278 patent teaches a method of \u201cauto-\n matically\u201d generating animations using morph weight sets.\n In particular, it describes a method in which a time-\n marked transcript of recorded text denoting each pho-\n neme\u2014a \u201ctime aligned phonetic transcription\u201d (TAPT)\u2014is\n received by a computer system. Id., col. 2, line 64, through\n col. 3, line 5. The system takes this input and applies \u201ca\n set of rules that determine the system[\u2019]s output compris-\n ing a stream or streams of morph weight sets.\u201d Id., col. 3,\n lines 2\u20135. The specification describes an exemplary set of\n rules, with six distinct morph targets, for animating the\n word \u201chello.\u201d See id., col. 7, line 33, through col. 8, line 55.\n It further provides several \u201cillustrative examples of other\n rules which may be used.\u201d See id., col. 9, line 32, through\n col. 11, line 11.\n      McRO asserts claims 1, 4, and 13 of its patent. Claim\n 1 is representative for purposes of the issues on appeal:\n     1.

J.A. 4649.\n Each bone stores information, whether as a 4x4 matrix or\n as an equivalent 16-term vector, that acts as a \u201ctransform\u201d\n to direct the attached vertices to move to certain positions.\n J.A. 4650. This movement, which can be complex, gener-\n ally combines \u201csimpler linear transformations such as ro-\n tations, translations, [or] scales.\u201d Id. Because a vertex can\n attach to multiple bones, each bone is assigned a weight\n and the \u201cresulting position of a vertex is determined by\n blending the transforms that it is attached to according to\n the weights.\u201d J.A. 4649.\n      After claim construction, the Developers filed a motion\n for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that each asserted\n\fCase: 19-1557      Document: 88    Page: 7    Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA                  7\n\n\n\n claim is invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. In 2014, the district\n court granted the Developers judgment on the pleadings\n and terminated the case. McRO, Inc. v. Sony Computer\n Entertainment America, LLC, 55 F. Supp. 3d 1214 (C.D.\n Cal. 2014). Although the claims \u201care tangible, each cover-\n ing an approach to automated three-dimensional computer\n animation,\u201d the court noted, the claims \u201cpreempt the field\n of lip synchronization using a rules-based morph target ap-\n proach.\u201d Id. at 1224, 1227.\n     We reversed the district court\u2019s determination. McRO\n I, 837 F.3d at 1302\u201303.

We agree with the Developers that the claim\n term \u201cmorph weight set\u201d requires three-dimensional vec-\n tors. That is, we conclude that the district court was cor-\n rect as a matter of law in ruling that a \u201cvector,\u201d in the\n\fCase: 19-1557      Document: 88    Page: 9    Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v.

Because the\n parties agree that there is no infringement under this con-\n struction, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant to the Devel-\n opers of summary judgment of noninfringement.\n      The district court construed the term \u201cmorph weight\n set\u201d as \u201c[a] set of values, one for each delta set, that, when\n applied, transform the neutral model to some desired state,\n wherein each delta set is the set of vectors from each vertex\n on the neutral (reference) model to each vertex on a model\n of another mouth position.\u201d J.A. 902. This construction\n combines two express definitions from the specification\u2014\n \u201cmorph weight set\u201d is defined in terms of a \u201cdelta set,\u201d\n which, in turn, is defined in terms of \u201cvectors.\u201d \u2019278 patent,\n col. 4, lines 35\u201337; id., col. 1, lines 60\u201362. The parties do\n not dispute this construction of \u201cmorph weight set.\u201d\n      The parties do dispute the meaning of \u201cvector\u201d within\n that construction. The district court construed \u201cvector\u201d as\n \u201ca vector with direction and magnitude in three-dimen-\n sional space.\u201d J.A. 21. This construction accords with the\n Developers\u2019 argument that \u201cthe vectors constituting the\n \u2018delta set\u2019 must be vectors in three-dimensional space.\u201d\n J.A. 7302. The construction rejects McRO\u2019s proposal that\n the term should be construed as, simply, \u201can ordered set of\n numbers.\u201d J.A. 6138. The court noted that it had already\n \u201crejected [McRO\u2019s] request to construe \u2018delta set\u2019 in the con-\n text of \u2018morph weight set\u2019 as \u2018wherein each delta set is the\n mathematical representation of the difference between the\n neutral model and another model,\u2019\u201d and the court con-\n cluded that McRO was \u201ceffectively urging the same imper-\n missibly broad meaning.\u201d J.A. 17.\n     The difference matters for assessing the accused bones\n system for infringement. The bones system, in its relevant\n aspect, uses vectors as that term is used in one general\n\fCase: 19-1557     Document: 88       Page: 10     Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                 MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA\n\n\n\n mathematical sense, i.e., any ordered collection of individ-\n ual terms such as (a1, a2, a3, . . ., an). But there is no dispute\n that the relevant aspect of the bones system does not come\n within the meaning of \u201cvector\u201d if that word is limited, in\n the \u2019278 patent, to the ordinary three-dimensional geomet-\n ric vector, which can be represented by a three-term se-\n quence (ax, ay, az), each term for one of the three spatial\n dimensions. The district court adopted the latter construc-\n tion, rejecting infringement on that basis.\n      We agree with the district court. The proper claim con-\n struction is based \u201cnot only in the context of the particular\n claim in which the disputed term appears, but in the con-\n text of the entire patent, including the specification.\u201d Phil-\n lips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1313\u201316 (Fed. Cir. 2005);\n see Ruckus Wireless, Inc. v. Innovative Wireless Solutions,\n LLC, 824 F.3d 999, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\u201cUltimately,\n \u2018[t]he only meaning that matters in claim construction is\n the meaning in the context of the patent.\u2019\u201d (quoting Trus-\n tees of Columbia Univ. v. Symantec Corp., 811 F.3d 1359,\n 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2016))). Here, the specification compels the\n three-dimensional geometric construction of \u201cvector\u201d\n adopted by the district court.\n     Vertices in the neutral model (points on a face) are lo-\n cations in three-dimensional space, and the specification\u2019s\n express definition of \u201cdelta set\u201d requires a one-to-one corre-\n spondence between the vertices of the neutral model and\n the vertices of each morph target, with a \u201cvector\u201d connect-\n ing these corresponding vertices in three-dimensional\n space. According to the specification, a \u201cdelta\u201d is \u201ccom-\n puted as a vector from each vertex n on the reference to each\n vertex n on each morph target.\u201d \u2019278 patent, col. 1, lines\n 60\u201362 (emphasis added). The term \u201cvertex\u201d naturally car-\n ries a spatial meaning, as do the words \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto,\u201d and\n they imply that a delta is a direct path from the vertex (a\n spatial point) on the reference to the vertex (a spatial point)\n on the morph target, i.e., a three-dimensional vector. The\n conclusion is reinforced by the specification\u2019s statement, in\n\fCase: 19-1557     Document: 88     Page: 11     Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA                  11\n\n\n\n the paragraph preceding the definitional sentence, that\n \u201c[e]ach morph target has the same topology as the neutral\n model . . . .\u201d Id., col. 1, lines 53\u201356 (emphasis added). All\n these terms strongly favor the narrow geometric meaning\n of \u201cvector\u201d\u2014especially in the spatial context of the inven-\n tion, reflected in claim 1\u2019s stated object of creating visually\n recognizable \u201cthree-dimensional characters.\u201d Id., col. 11,\n line 44.\n     The equation in the specification confirms the require-\n ment of three-dimensional vectors that can be added and\n subtracted. Each delta set (a set of vectors) is assigned a\n \u201cscalar\u201d morph weight, \u201cusually from 0 to 1,\u201d and each vec-\n tor is multiplied by that scalar value. See id., col. 1, line\n 65, through col. 2, line 3. Then, the corresponding scalar-\n multiplied vectors from each set are added together\u2014these\n summations are, finally, added to the corresponding neu-\n tral vertices. Id., col. 2, lines 5\u20139. The specification pro-\n vides an equation that summarizes this process:\n\n\n\n\n J.A. 15 (cleaning up \u2019278 patent, col. 2, line 6).\n      The specification\u2019s surrounding discussion confirms\n that this equation is naturally understood as referring to\n three-dimensional vectors. The \u201csymbol |xxx| is used to\n indicate the corresponding vector in each referenced set,\u201d\n the specification explains, and, specifically, |neutral| rep-\n resents \u201cvertex v in the neutral model.\u201d See \u2019278 patent,\n col. 2, lines 5\u201313. The vertex in the neutral model (a point\n on a face) is a location in three-dimensional space, which is\n represented by a three-dimensional vector from the Carte-\n sian origin. Accordingly, to add |neutral| to the result of\n the summation, the result of the summation must be a\n three-dimensional vector.         And to get that result,\n |delta setx| must also be a three-dimensional vector.\n Thus, the equation strongly supports the district court\u2019s\n\fCase: 19-1557    Document: 88      Page: 12   Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12               MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA\n\n\n\n construction: a \u201cvector\u201d must have \u201c3-D magnitude and di-\n rection computed by pure subtraction/addition between the\n neutral and target models, with one vector corresponding\n to each set of two vertices.\u201d J.A. 16\u201317.\n      McRO offers two arguments that this specification evi-\n dence should be interpreted differently. The first argu-\n ment, which relies on the key definitional sentence,\n misreads our precedent and ignores most of the language\n in that sentence. According to McRO, the phrase \u201ca vector\n from each vertex n on the reference\u201d implies that each ver-\n tex on the reference can have multiple corresponding vec-\n tors because \u201cit is a well settled rule that the article \u2018a\u2019\n means one or more and not \u2018a single.\u2019\u201d Brief for Appellant\n at 24 (citing KCJ Corp. v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 223 F.3d\n 1351, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). The patent would have used\n the phrase \u201ca single vector,\u201d McRO argues, if it had meant\n to require one-to-one correspondence. Id. But McRO mis-\n reads KCJ Corp., which explains that \u201can indefinite article\n \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018an\u2019 in patent parlance carries the meaning of \u2018one or\n more\u2019 in open-ended claims containing the transitional\n phrase \u2018comprising.\u2019\u201d 223 F.3d at 1356 (emphasis added).\n This specific canon of claim construction has no bearing\n here. And as discussed, the word \u201ca\u201d is hardly the only rel-\n evant textual evidence of meaning.\n      McRO\u2019s second argument, which relies on the para-\n graph in the specification that precedes the key definitional\n sentence, gives too much weight to an ambiguous phrase\n that does not clearly refer to the relevant term. After dis-\n cussing the topological correspondence between the neu-\n tral model and each morph target, the passage states that\n \u201csuch rigid correspondence may not be necessary.\u201d Id., col.\n 1, lines 58\u201359. This language, McRO contends, overrides\n the natural understanding of all the specification evidence\n we have discussed and renders the specification\u2019s guidance\n optional. But the statement that \u201csuch rigid correspond-\n ence may not be necessary\u201d is too equivocal and uncertain\n to alter the clear teaching of the specification. Indeed, it\n\fCase: 19-1557     Document: 88     Page: 13     Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA                  13\n\n\n\n does not even refer specifically to the claim term, \u201cmorph\n weight set\u201d; it might be referring to some notion independ-\n ent of that claim limitation, which, by the specification, is\n defined to include the \u201cvector\u201d requirement. Nothing in the\n specification shows a use of \u201cvector,\u201d or representation of\n \u201cdelta sets\u201d (sets of vectors), other than the ordinary, geo-\n metric, three-dimensional one.\n      What remains is McRO\u2019s brief argument, relying on ex-\n trinsic evidence, that one ordinary meaning of \u201cvector\u201d is\n broader than the district court\u2019s construction. Citing a\n computer graphics textbook called \u201cReal Time Rendering,\u201d\n Dr. Gleicher (McRO\u2019s expert) stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018vec-\n tor\u2019 in mathematics, computer science and computer\n graphics is a general concept that roughly means an or-\n dered list of numbers.\u201d J.A. 2289 (citing J.A. 2068\u201369). It\n is, in fact, not disputed that one broad meaning of \u201cvector\u201d\n in mathematics and other fields is an \u201cordered list of num-\n bers.\u201d But the existence of one broader meaning in the field\n is not controlling. What matters is the meaning most ap-\n propriate in the context of the particular patent. Here, it\n is clear, based on the intrinsic evidence, that the term \u201cvec-\n tor\u201d has the narrower geometric meaning in this patent.\n That construction, as is undisputed, compels the judgment\n of noninfringement, which we therefore affirm.\n                               B\n      We now address McRO\u2019s appeal of the judgment of in-\n validity based on the specification\u2019s failure to enable the\n full scope of claim 1\u2019s required \u201cfirst set of rules.\u201d We agree\n with McRO that the Developers failed to identify with par-\n ticularity any method of animation that falls within the\n scope of claim 1 and is not enabled. Without any specific\n examples, the district court\u2019s reasoning is too abstract, too\n conclusory, to support summary judgment. We do not go\n so far as to hold that there is a triable issue of fact on ena-\n blement\u2014instead, we vacate the judgment and remand for\n the district court to consider how to proceed.\n\fCase: 19-1557    Document: 88        Page: 14   Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14                MCRO, INC.   v.

In MagSil Corp. v. Hitachi\n Global Storage Technologies, Inc., 687 F.3d 1377, 1381\u201383\n (Fed.

In\n Sitrick v. Dreamworks, LLC, 516 F.3d 993, 999\u20131001 (Fed.\n Cir. 2008), the claim covered both video games and movies,\n and it was movies that the court held to be not enabled. In\n In re Vaeck, 947 F.2d at 495, the claims covered use of any\n of the many known species of cyanobacteria, but there was\n no enabling of the required gene expression in any but a\n small subset (and such expression in cyanobacteria was un-\n predictable). In Trustees of Boston University v. Everlight\n\fCase: 19-1557     Document: 88      Page: 17     Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA                    17\n\n\n\n Electronics Co. Ltd., 896 F.3d 1357, 1360, 1362 (Fed. Cir.\n 2018), the parties agreed that the claim covered six permu-\n tations for the relationship between a growth layer and a\n buffer layer, and it was one of those permutations that the\n court concluded was not enabled. 3\n     In short, none of the cases invoked by the district court\n and by the Developers have involved an abstract assertion\n of breadth, without concrete identification of matter that is\n not enabled but is or may be within the claim scope. As\n next explained, this case, in its current posture, involves\n such an abstract assertion of breadth. Under our claim\n construction, the bones and BALDI techniques are nonin-\n fringing and so cannot support a nonenablement determi-\n nation. And no other concretely identified animation\n techniques have been advanced to support the district\n court\u2019s and Developers\u2019 enablement analyses.\n                                2\n      The district court in this case determined that the spec-\n ification of the \u2019278 patent fails to enable claim 1\u2019s \u201cfirst set\n of rules\u201d limitation. Enablement Opinion at *10. Specifi-\n cally, claim 1 requires \u201cobtaining a first set of rules that\n defines a morph weight set stream as a function of pho-\n neme sequence and times associated with said phoneme\n\n\n\n     3    See also Idenix, 941 F.3d at 1157 (vast number of\n substituents at positions on ring other than 2\u2032-up); Enzo\n Life Scis., 928 F.3d at 1346\u201367, 1349 (all phosphate-labeled\n polynucleotides that are hybridizable and detectable, in-\n cluding any type of labels and linkages and any location of\n labels); Wyeth, 720 F.3d at 1384, 1387 (large number of\n compounds varying substituent groups outside a sirolimus\n ring and of potential rapamycin compounds); ALZA, 603\n F.3d at 939 (non-osmotic oral dosage forms\u2014tablets and\n capsules); Enzo Biochem, 188 F.3d at 1372 (all eukaryotic\n and prokaryotic cell types).\n\fCase: 19-1557    Document: 88       Page: 18   Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18                MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA\n\n\n\n sequence.\u201d \u2019278 patent, col. 11, lines 43\u201348. This claim, the\n specification reveals, requires at least two operations.\n      First, the specification makes clear that obtaining the\n set of rules presupposes identifying which mouth shapes\n (morph targets) should be used for representing a particu-\n lar phoneme (or phoneme sequence) appearing on the \u201ctime\n aligned phonetic transcription\u201d that is being synched to an\n animation. See id., col. 4, lines 31\u201345 (\u201cThe method prefer-\n ably comprises a set of rules that determine what the out-\n put morph weight set stream will be when any sequence\n o[f] phonemes and their associated times is encountered.\u201d);\n id., col. 1, lines 49\u201353 (\u201cmorph targets\u201d are models of mouth\n positions\u2014one \u201creference model\u201d corresponds to a \u201cneutral\n mouth position,\u201d while other models display \u201cother mouth\n positions, each corresponding to a different phoneme or set\n of phonemes\u201d). For example, the specification explains, an\n artist would have to know that \u201cthe \u2018l\u2019 in \u2018hello\u2019\u201d requires a\n wider mouth shape than the \u201c\u2018l\u2019 in \u2018burly.\u2019\u201d \u2019278 patent, col.\n 10, lines 22\u201325.\n     But on the record before us, this aspect of the claimed\n rules need not have been taught in the specification, and\n the district court did not rule otherwise. An \u201cartisan\u2019s\n knowledge of the prior art and routine experimentation can\n often fill gaps, interpolate between embodiments, and per-\n haps even extrapolate beyond the disclosed embodiments,\n depending upon the predictability of the art,\u201d AK Steel, 344\n F.3d at 1244, and a \u201cpatent need not teach, and preferably\n omits, what is well known in the art,\u201d Spectra-Physics, Inc.\n v. Coherent, Inc., 827 F.2d 1524, 1534 (Fed. Cir. 1987).\n Here, the district court explained that \u201cboth experts appar-\n ently agree that the state of computer animation overall\n and the development of rules for animation was well-devel-\n oped in other contexts.\u201d Enablement Opinion at *17; see\n J.A. 4945 (McRO\u2019s expert); J.A. 5772 (the Developers\u2019 ex-\n pert). The specification itself indicates that animators\n knew how to match mouth positions to phonemes\u2014doing\n so just took a significant amount of time because the\n\fCase: 19-1557     Document: 88     Page: 19    Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA                 19\n\n\n\n process was manual. See \u2019278 patent, col. 2, lines 26\u201342.\n The inventors here do not purport to have discovered that\n the \u201cl\u201d in \u201chello\u201d requires a wider mouth shape than the \u201cl\u201d\n in \u201cburly.\u201d\n      The second, and assertedly novel, aspect of the inven-\n tion, is a set of rules that tells the system how to automat-\n ically output the chosen mouth shapes in a format that can\n create an animation\u2014as a continuous stream of morph\n weight sets that can transform a neutral model. See id.,\n col. 4, lines 46\u201360 (\u201cThe primary function of the rules is to\n determine[] 1) the appropriate morph weight set corre-\n spondence with each TAPT sub-sequence; and 2) the time\n parameters of the morph weight set transitions between\n the representation of the prior TAPT sub-sequence or other\n timed data and the current one.\u201d). Because this process is\n the novel aspect of the claimed invention, the specification\n must reasonably teach how to make and use this aspect of\n the invention. See Auto. Techs., 501 F.3d at 1283; Genen-\n tech, 108 F.3d at 1366.\n                               3\n     The Developers have not, at this point in the case, met\n their burden of identifying a set of rules, for automatically\n outputting chosen mouth shapes, that is or may be within\n the scope of claim 1. See MagSil, 687 F.3d at 1380 (\u201cA party\n must prove invalidity based on nonenablement by clear\n and convincing evidence.\u201d).\n     The district court identified, and relied on for the \u201cmore\n important[]\u201d part of its analysis, two specific examples of-\n fered by Dr. Wyvill (the Developers\u2019 expert): bones anima-\n tion (the accused product) and the BALDI system.\n Enablement Opinion at *12. As discussed above, bones an-\n imation uses 4x4 matrices or vectors of length sixteen to\n perform a combination of linear transformations on multi-\n ple vertices. J.A. 4649\u201350. Similarly, as the district court\n recognized, the BALDI system uses an \u201c\u2018interlocking set of\n mathematical equations . . . that balance the influence of\n\fCase: 19-1557    Document: 88       Page: 20    Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 20                MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA\n\n\n\n different proximate phonemes on various aspects of the\n model\u2019s facial expression.\u2019\u201d Enablement Opinion at *12\n (citing J.A. 5891\u201392). Dr. Wyvill stated that the specifica-\n tion of the \u2019278 patent does not \u201ceven remotely suggest that\n the inventor had possession of the species of rule sets that\n defines a morph weight set stream as a function of pho-\n neme sequence and time for bone animation,\u201d J.A. 5893,\n and that the \u201cBALDI system provides a good example of a\n system that uses \u2018rules\u2019 that are far more complex and in-\n tricate than anything the \u2019278 Patent describes,\u201d J.A. 5891.\n The district court concluded that those statements \u201csuggest\n that at the time of the invention, a person of skill in the art\n would not have the tools to practice the full scope of the\n \u2018first set of rules\u2019 limitation.\u201d Enablement Opinion at *12.\n     Given our construction of the term \u201cmorph weight\n sets,\u201d however, both bones animation and the BALDI sys-\n tem are clearly \u201coutside the scope of the claims\u201d and are\n thus \u201cirrelevant to enablement.\u201d See Durel, 256 F.3d at\n 1307. With respect to bones animation, our noninfringe-\n ment decision compels this conclusion\u2014\u201cbones\u201d are not,\n and do not use, three-dimensional geometric vectors to\n move vertices. See supra pp. 10\u201313; see also Brief for Ap-\n pellee at 15 (\u201cBone transform values . . . do not specify, or\n even contain enough information to derive, the position or\n the displacement of any vertex on any facial model.\u201d). Rec-\n ord evidence compels the same conclusion with respect to\n the BALDI process, at least in the context of a summary-\n judgment motion. Dr. Wyvill, in the context of an expert\n opinion regarding obviousness, conceded that BALDI\u2019s \u201cpa-\n rameter target values corresponding to each phoneme do\n not represent delta sets as construed\u201d and that BALDI\u2019s\n equations \u201cdo not represent the displacements of each ver-\n tex in terms of a simple xyz displacement vector.\u201d J.A.\n 5839.\n\fCase: 19-1557     Document: 88       Page: 21      Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA                      21\n\n\n\n                                 4\n     Without bones animation and the BALDI process avail-\n able as claim-covered techniques that must be enabled, the\n district court\u2019s reasoning is too abstract and too conclusory\n to support summary judgment.\n       Apart from its discussion of bones and BALDI, the dis-\n trict court made two basic observations. First, the court\n noted, the \u201cfirst set of rules\u201d limitation \u201cis broad, encom-\n passing more than simply a rule scheme that involves rules\n applied at keyframes or rules in the form of \u2018if . . . then . . .\n else\u2019 constructs.\u201d Enablement Opinion at *8. Second, the\n court stated, a \u201creview of the specification supports the con-\n clusion that the patent disclosure only provides working\n examples of rules related to a keyframe approach using an\n \u2018if . . . then . . . else\u2019 construct.\u201d Id. at *10. Tying these two\n observations together, the court concluded that McRO had\n failed to \u201cprovide . . . any exemplary metric that might al-\n low the [c]ourt to understand the exact bounds of what is\n claimed in the \u2019278 Patent as a first set of rules.\u201d Id. at *11.\n Accordingly, McRO could not \u201cavoid an enablement chal-\n lenge by simply arguing that [the Appellees] ha[d] failed to\n identify an operative alternative embodiment.\u201d Id.\n     But these observations merely state the conclusion\n that the claims are too broad and the specification\u2019s discus-\n sion is too narrow. The observations do not justify the con-\n clusion with any concrete support. To say that the \u201cfirst\n set of rules\u201d limitation is broader than \u201cif . . . then . . . else\u201d\n statements based on keyframes is not to say what else is or\n may be within the phrase\u2014and it was the burden of the\n Developers, not McRO, to prove that such specific content\n exists and that it is not enabled. Where, as here, there is\n at least some expert testimony supporting enablement,\n even if at a high level of generality, see, e.g., J.A. 4893\u201394,\n J.A. 4944\u201347, the district court\u2019s reasoning and the support\n offered by the Developers are not enough to justify sum-\n mary judgment of nonenablement for the Developers.\n\fCase: 19-1557      Document: 88        Page: 22   Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 22                 MCRO, INC.   v. BANDAI NAMCO GAMES AMERICA\n\n\n\n      We see no reason in this case to depart from our usual\n requirement that the challenger identify specifics that are\n or may be within the claim but are not enabled. Specifics\n have always mattered. See supra pp. 16\u201317. Here, a \u201cfuller\n set of fact-findings [about what is] within the scope of the\n claims\u201d is necessary \u201cto decide the enablement issue.\u201d Du-\n rel, 256 F.3d at 1307.\n                                 III\n      We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment that the Devel-\n opers did not infringe the \u2019278 patent. We vacate the dis-\n trict court\u2019s judgment that the Developers were entitled to\n summary judgment that the \u2019278 patent is invalid for lack\n of enablement. Without holding that the Developers could\n not make such a showing, we remand the case for such fur-\n ther proceedings as are appropriate, considering the Devel-\n opers\u2019 offer to withdraw their invalidity counterclaims. 4\n       The parties shall bear their own costs.\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND\n                    REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n       4We deny McRO\u2019s request to direct that the case be\n assigned to a different district judge on remand.

Because the\n parties agree that there is no infringement under this con-\n struction, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant to the Devel-\n opers of summary judgment of noninfringement.\n      The district court construed the term \u201cmorph weight\n set\u201d as \u201c[a] set of values, one for each delta set, that, when\n applied, transform the neutral model to some desired state,\n wherein each delta set is the set of vectors from each vertex\n on the neutral (reference) model to each vertex on a model\n of another mouth position.\u201d J.A. 902.

The district court construed \u201cvector\u201d as\n \u201ca vector with direction and magnitude in three-dimen-\n sional space.\u201d J.A. 21. This construction accords with the\n Developers\u2019 argument that \u201cthe vectors constituting the\n \u2018delta set\u2019 must be vectors in three-dimensional space.\u201d\n J.A. 7302. The construction rejects McRO\u2019s proposal that\n the term should be construed as, simply, \u201can ordered set of\n numbers.\u201d J.A. 6138. The court noted that it had already\n \u201crejected [McRO\u2019s] request to construe \u2018delta set\u2019 in the con-\n text of \u2018morph weight set\u2019 as \u2018wherein each delta set is the\n mathematical representation of the difference between the\n neutral model and another model,\u2019\u201d and the court con-\n cluded that McRO was \u201ceffectively urging the same imper-\n missibly broad meaning.\u201d J.A. 17.\n     The difference matters for assessing the accused bones\n system for infringement. The bones system, in its relevant\n aspect, uses vectors as that term is used in one general\n\fCase: 19-1557     Document: 88       Page: 10     Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                 MCRO, INC.   v.

But there is no dispute\n that the relevant aspect of the bones system does not come\n within the meaning of \u201cvector\u201d if that word is limited, in\n the \u2019278 patent, to the ordinary three-dimensional geomet-\n ric vector, which can be represented by a three-term se-\n quence (ax, ay, az), each term for one of the three spatial\n dimensions. The district court adopted the latter construc-\n tion, rejecting infringement on that basis.\n      We agree with the district court.

Here, the specification compels the\n three-dimensional geometric construction of \u201cvector\u201d\n adopted by the district court.\n     Vertices in the neutral model (points on a face) are lo-\n cations in three-dimensional space, and the specification\u2019s\n express definition of \u201cdelta set\u201d requires a one-to-one corre-\n spondence between the vertices of the neutral model and\n the vertices of each morph target, with a \u201cvector\u201d connect-\n ing these corresponding vertices in three-dimensional\n space.

Nothing in the\n specification shows a use of \u201cvector,\u201d or representation of\n \u201cdelta sets\u201d (sets of vectors), other than the ordinary, geo-\n metric, three-dimensional one.\n      What remains is McRO\u2019s brief argument, relying on ex-\n trinsic evidence, that one ordinary meaning of \u201cvector\u201d is\n broader than the district court\u2019s construction. Citing a\n computer graphics textbook called \u201cReal Time Rendering,\u201d\n Dr. Gleicher (McRO\u2019s expert) stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018vec-\n tor\u2019 in mathematics, computer science and computer\n graphics is a general concept that roughly means an or-\n dered list of numbers.\u201d J.A. 2289 (citing J.A. 2068\u201369). It\n is, in fact, not disputed that one broad meaning of \u201cvector\u201d\n in mathematics and other fields is an \u201cordered list of num-\n bers.\u201d But the existence of one broader meaning in the field\n is not controlling. What matters is the meaning most ap-\n propriate in the context of the particular patent. Here, it\n is clear, based on the intrinsic evidence, that the term \u201cvec-\n tor\u201d has the narrower geometric meaning in this patent.\n That construction, as is undisputed, compels the judgment\n of noninfringement, which we therefore affirm.\n                               B\n      We now address McRO\u2019s appeal of the judgment of in-\n validity based on the specification\u2019s failure to enable the\n full scope of claim 1\u2019s required \u201cfirst set of rules.\u201d We agree\n with McRO that the Developers failed to identify with par-\n ticularity any method of animation that falls within the\n scope of claim 1 and is not enabled. Without any specific\n examples, the district court\u2019s reasoning is too abstract, too\n conclusory, to support summary judgment. We do not go\n so far as to hold that there is a triable issue of fact on ena-\n blement\u2014instead, we vacate the judgment and remand for\n the district court to consider how to proceed.\n\fCase: 19-1557    Document: 88        Page: 14   Filed: 05/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14                MCRO, INC.   v.

Because the\n Board correctly held that Electric Boat\u2019s claim is barred by\n the statute of limitations, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     On August 14, 2003, Electric Boat and the Navy en-\n tered into a contract (the Contract) for the construction of\n up to six separate Virginia-class nuclear-powered subma-\n rines (SSNs), SSN 778 through SSN 783. 1 The Contract\n established a target price for each submarine, comprising\n the sum of the target cost and the target profit. See J.A. 84\n (SSN 783). Electric Boat was entitled to periodic progress\n payments proportional to Electric Boat\u2019s overall construc-\n tion progress. J.A. 271\u201379 (Clause H-29). The Navy was\n required to fully compensate Electric Boat under the Con-\n tract until Electric Boat\u2019s invoiced costs exceeded\n\n\n     1    The Contract between Electric Boat and the Navy\n funded full construction of only the first submarine, SSN\n 778. Pursuant to Clause H-17 of the Contract, the remain-\n ing five submarines were funded on an installment basis\n and the parties\u2019 obligations under the Contract were en-\n tirely contingent on the future availability of funds. J.A.\n 238\u201339. The Navy modified the Contract in January 2004,\n transitioning the contract to a multi-year procurement con-\n tract for the remaining five submarines. J.A. 396. Clause\n H-20 of the modified contract maintained the installment\n funding and contingency provisions of Clause H-17.\n\fCase: 19-1621     Document: 42     Page: 3    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY                       3\n\n\n\n construction progress at the target price, less certain ad-\n justments. Id.\n     The Contract incorporates by reference the standard\n Changes Clause under 48 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 52.243-1, -2. J.A. 335,\n 344. The Changes Clause requires that the Navy\u2019s Con-\n tracting Officer \u201cmake an equitable adjustment in the con-\n tract price, the delivery schedule, or both\u201d in the event that\n the Contracting Officer makes a change to the contract that\n \u201ccauses an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time\n required for, performance.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.243-1(b). The\n Contract also includes a \u201cChange-of-Law Clause,\u201d which\n provides for a price adjustment in the event that compli-\n ance with a new federal law, or a change to existing federal\n laws or regulations, directly increases or decreases Electric\n Boat\u2019s costs of performance. J.A. 279\u201381 (Clause H-30).\n The Change-of-Law Clause specifies that no cost adjust-\n ments shall be made thereunder for the first two years af-\n ter the effective date of the Contract (i.e., until August 15,\n 2005). J.A. 280. After two years, adjustments shall only\n be made if a qualifying change of law increases Electric\n Boat\u2019s costs of performance \u201cin excess of $125,000 per ship.\u201d\n J.A. 281 (Clause H-30(c)).\n     The Change-of-Law Clause requires that Electric Boat\n promptly notify the Navy\u2019s Contracting Officer of a quali-\n fying enactment or change in federal law. J.A. 281 (Clause\n H-30(d)). Section (e) of the Change-of-Law Clause further\n provides that requests for price adjustments thereunder be\n made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Clause\n H-9, entitled \u201cDocumentations of Requests for Equitable\n Adjustment.\u201d J.A. 281 (Clause H-30(e)). Clause H-9 sets\n forth uniform procedures for submitting requests for equi-\n table adjustments under all articles of the Contract, includ-\n ing the standard Changes Clause. J.A. 228.\n     On September 15, 2004, OSHA issued a new federal\n regulation entitled Fire Protection in Shipyard Employ-\n ment (the OSHA Regulation). See 69 Fed. Reg. 55,668\n\fCase: 19-1621    Document: 42      Page: 4    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                      ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY\n\n\n\n\n (Sept. 15, 2004) (codified at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.501 et seq.).\n The OSHA Regulation, which became effective on Decem-\n ber 14, 2004, required companies to post a fire watch if cer-\n tain conditions are present during \u201chot work\u201d in shipyard\n employment. See id.; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.504(b). On Febru-\n ary 24, 2005, Electric Boat submitted a Notification of\n Change to the Navy. J.A. 453\u201357. The Notification stated\n that \u201cElectric Boat anticipates that compliance with [the\n OSHA Regulation] will result in an increase in the cost of\n performance [under the Contract] in excess of $125,000 per\n ship.\u201d J.A. 453.\n     On June 27, 2007, Electric Boat submitted a cost pro-\n posal to the Navy, seeking price adjustments across all six\n submarines. J.A. 459\u201369. In October 2008, the Navy coun-\n tered, challenging Electric Boat\u2019s calculations of certain\n costs. J.A. 554\u201357. In April 2009, Electric Boat submitted\n a revised cost proposal to the Navy. J.A. 559\u201367. On May\n 2, 2011, the Contracting Officer of the Navy issued a mem-\n orandum decision formally denying Electric Boat \u201centitle-\n ment to an adjustment of the contract price.\u201d J.A. 705\u201310.\n The memorandum stated that Electric Boat\u2019s cost pro-\n posals had \u201cinadequate support\u201d and that there were \u201cdis-\n crepancies between [Electric Boat\u2019s] proposal and the\n Government\u2019s review of various documents related to the\n OSHA change.\u201d J.A. 708. The memorandum further stated\n that if Electric Boat decided to further pursue an adjust-\n ment related to the OSHA Regulation, \u201cit should seek ad-\n justment pursuant to [regulations governing] \u2018Requests for\n Equitable Adjustment\u2019\u201d by June 3, 2011. Id.\n     On December 19, 2012, Electric Boat filed a certified\n claim with the Navy, seeking a price adjustment for in-\n creased costs it allegedly incurred in complying with the\n OSHA Regulation. J.A. 711\u201312. On February 27, 2013, the\n government issued a Contracting Officer\u2019s Final Decision\n denying Electric Boat\u2019s claim. J.A. 713\u201330. Electric Boat\n appealed the Contracting Officer\u2019s Final Decision to the\n Board. The Navy moved for summary judgment that\n\fCase: 19-1621    Document: 42      Page: 5   Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY                     5\n\n\n\n Electric Boat\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limita-\n tions. Electric Boat filed a cross-motion for summary judg-\n ment that its claim was timely filed.\n      On December 10, 2018, the Board granted-in-part the\n Navy\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Elec-\n tric Boat\u2019s complaint. 2 J.A. 17. The Board determined that\n Electric Boat knew of its claim no later than February\n 2005, when Electric Boat submitted its Notification of\n Change to the Navy. J.A. 10. The Board further held that\n Electric Boat \u201csuffered some injury not later than August\n 15, 2005, the date two years after the effective date of the\n [C]ontract when [the Change-of-Law Clause] would first\n provide the right to a price adjustment.\u201d J.A. 10. Because\n Electric Boat\u2019s Claim was not filed until December 2012,\n more than six years after the August 2005 accrual date, the\n Board held that Electric Boat\u2019s claim was untimely. J.A.\n 17. Electric Boat appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant\n to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(10).\n                         DISCUSSION\n      We review the Board\u2019s grant of summary judgment de\n novo. Gates v. Raytheon Co., 584 F.3d 1062, 1067 (Fed. Cir.\n 2009). Interpretation of a government contract is question\n of law, which we also review de novo. See Forman v. United\n States, 329 F.3d 837, 841 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Though not\n binding on the Court, we give the Board\u2019s legal conclusions\n careful consideration in view of the Board\u2019s considerable\n experience in construing government contracts. See Gates,\n 584 F.3d at 1067.\n\n\n\n\n     2   The Board denied the Navy\u2019s motion for summary\n judgment as it pertained to Electric Boat\u2019s claim for costs\n incurred by Electric Boat\u2019s subcontractor, Huntington\n Ingalls, Inc. J.A. 17\u201318. The Navy has not challenged this\n aspect of the Board\u2019s decision on appeal.\n\fCase: 19-1621    Document: 42      Page: 6    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                      ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY\n\n\n\n\n                             I.\n      A CDA claim \u201cshall be submitted within 6 years after\n the accrual of the claim.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(4)(A).\n Whether and when a claim has accrued is determined ac-\n cording to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the\n language of the contract, and the facts of the particular\n case. Kellogg Brown & Root Servs., Inc. v. Murphy, 823\n F.3d 622, 626 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The FAR defines claim ac-\n crual as \u201cthe date when all events, that fix the alleged lia-\n bility of either the Government or the contractor and\n permit assertion of the claim, were known or should have\n been known.\u201d See 48 CFR \u00a7 33.201. Although \u201cmonetary\n damages need not have been incurred,\u201d \u201c[f]or liability to be\n fixed, some injury must have occurred.\u201d Id. We conclude\n the Board correctly determined that Electric Boat\u2019s claim\n accrued more than six years before Electric Boat submitted\n its claim and that Electric Boat\u2019s claim is therefore barred\n by the statute of limitations.\n     The plain language of the Contract compels our conclu-\n sion. It provides that:\n     (b) If, at any time after the effective date of this\n     contract, a New Federal Law is enacted or a change\n     is made to a Currently Applicable Federal Law or\n     a New Federal Law or regulations thereunder\n     promulgated by Federal authorities, and compli-\n     ance with such new law or change directly results\n     in an increase or decrease in the Contractor\u2019s cost\n     of performance of this contract, the contract\n     price(s) shall be adjusted . . . . No such adjustment\n     shall be made for contract costs incurred or pro-\n     jected to be incurred during the two (2) year period\n     after the effective date of this contract.\n J.A. 280 (Clause H-30(b)). Electric Boat\u2019s injury under the\n Contract was the enactment of the OSHA Regulation, the\n compliance with which Electric Boat contends directly in-\n creased its costs of performance by more than $125,000 per\n\fCase: 19-1621    Document: 42      Page: 7    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY                      7\n\n\n\n submarine. See J.A. 453. Because the OSHA Regulation\n became effective in December 2004, the Navy\u2019s liability for\n a price adjustment became fixed under the Contract on Au-\n gust 15, 2005, when Clause H-30 first provides a right to a\n price adjustment. See J.A. 280. The Board correctly deter-\n mined that the Navy\u2019s liability was fixed, and therefore\n Electric Boat\u2019s claim accrued, on August 15, 2005, more\n than six years before Electric Boat filed its claim. See 48\n C.F.R. \u00a7 33.201.\n     Electric Boat contends that its claim for costs did not\n accrue until May 2, 2011 when the Navy\u2019s Contracting Of-\n ficer denied its request for a price adjustment. It argues\n that it was not injured under the Contract until it received\n notice of the Navy\u2019s intent to not adjust the contract price.\n Citing our decision in Kellogg Brown, Electric Boat argues\n that the Board therefore erroneously determined that the\n procedures required by the Change-of-Law Clause did not\n delay accrual of Electric Boat\u2019s claims. We do not agree.\n      Although \u201cthe limitations period does not begin to run\n if a claim cannot be filed because mandatory pre-claim pro-\n cedures have not been completed,\u201d the contract here did not\n require that Electric Boat undertake any such procedures.\n See Kellogg Brown, 823 F.3d at 628. In Kellogg Brown, the\n Army required that the contractor resolve disputed costs\n with the subcontractor before filing a claim for reimburse-\n ment. Id. We held that the contractor\u2019s claim therefore did\n not accrue until the contractor resolved cost disputes with\n the subcontractor as required by the contract. Id. at 628\u2013\n 29. The Contract here, however, expressly states that re-\n quests for price adjustments under the Change-of-Law\n Clause \u201cshall be made in accordance with the procedures of\n the requirement entitled \u2018DOCUMENTATION OF\n REQUESTS FOR EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT.\u2019\u201d J.A.\n 281 (Clause H-30(e)). The Contract therefore required that\n Electric Boat follow the standard equitable adjustment\n procedures set forth in Clause H-9 of the Contract. See J.A.\n 228, J.A. 334.      Although the Change-of-Law Clause\n\fCase: 19-1621     Document: 42     Page: 8    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                       ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY\n\n\n\n\n required Electric Boat to \u201cpromptly notify\u201d the Navy of a\n qualifying change in law, Electric Boat was not required to\n await a unilateral Navy price adjustment prior to filing a\n claim. See J.A. 281. Indeed, Electric Boat\u2019s injury under\n Clause H-30 of the contract was the enactment of the\n OSHA Regulation, not the Navy\u2019s refusal to adjust the\n price. 3 That the Navy did not formally refuse to adjust the\n price until May 2, 2011 therefore does not excuse Electric\n Boat\u2019s failure to timely file a claim in compliance with the\n CDA and the plain language of the Contract. See J.A. 228;\n see also J.A. 334 (incorporating by reference the FAR\u2019s\n standard Disputes Clause).\n                             II.\n     Electric Boat argues two alternative theories of partial\n timeliness. First, Electric Boat contends that its claim is\n timely as to five of the six submarines, SSN 779 through\n SSN 783, because Electric Boat\u2019s costs for these subma-\n rines did not exceed the target price until after December\n 19, 2006 (the Critical Date). Because its claims did not ex-\n ceed the target price, Electric Boat argues that it was being\n fully compensated and therefore had no claim for equitable\n adjustment for these submarines until after the Critical\n Date. Electric Boat\u2019s contention is unavailing.\n\n\n\n\n     3    Electric Boat\u2019s complaint alleged two counts of re-\n lief: one count for an entitlement to a price adjustment and\n the other count for breach of contract arising from the\n Navy\u2019s May 2, 2011 denial of Electric Boat\u2019s request for ad-\n justment. J.A. 75. Electric Boat waived any argument of\n timeliness under common law breach of contract principles\n by failing to argue before the Board that its injury arose\n from the Navy\u2019s alleged breach of contract on May 2, 2011.\n See J.A. 14 (identifying Electric Boat\u2019s alleged first date of\n actual injury as December 15, 2006).\n\fCase: 19-1621    Document: 42      Page: 9    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY                      9\n\n\n\n      Electric Boat was not required to incur actual costs for\n each submarine before filing a claim for equitable adjust-\n ment under the Contract. Instead, when Electric Boat\u2019s\n claim accrued in August 2005, Electric Boat had six years\n to file a claim for an equitable adjustment to the contrac-\n tual price terms, including the target cost for each subma-\n rine. See J.A. 280. That the Navy made progress payments\n to Electric Boat as required by Clause H-29 of the Contract\n does not excuse Electric Boat\u2019s untimeliness as to any of\n the six submarines. See J.A. 271\u201379 (Clause H-29). The\n Navy\u2019s payment of scheduled progress payments does not\n amount to agreement that Electric Boat is entitled to in-\n creased actual costs. There was an express provision under\n the contract for seeking such increased costs\u2014equitable\n adjustment.\n     Second, Electric Boat contends that its claims are\n timely as to the last two submarines, SSN 782 and SSN\n 783, because the Navy did not authorize funds for Electric\n Boat to begin construction on the final two ships until De-\n cember 28, 2006 and January 10, 2008, respectively. Be-\n cause Clause H-20 of the Contract made Electric Boat\u2019s\n performance contingent upon funding, Electric Boat argues\n it could not have known the \u201csum certain\u201d of additional\n costs that it would incur for these submarines until after\n the Critical Date. This contention is also unavailing.\n      Clause H-20 of the Contract merely provides that Elec-\n tric Boat\u2019s expenditure for each fiscal year is contingent on\n the appropriation of funds. J.A. 245. It establishes that\n Electric Boat was not authorized to make expenditures or\n incur obligations in excess of the amounts that the Con-\n tracting Officer had specified as available for performance.\n J.A. 245. Clause H-20 does not, however, make Congres-\n sional appropriation a condition precedent for seeking a\n price adjustment for each submarine. Thus, while Electric\n Boat was precluded from incurring actual costs in the hull\n construction of the final two submarines until funding had\n been approved, it was not precluded from filing a claim for\n\fCase: 19-1621     Document: 42    Page: 10    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                     ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY\n\n\n\n\n adjusted target costs for these two submarines under\n Clause H-30. 4 We therefore reject Electric Boat\u2019s second\n theory of partial timeliness, which runs counter to the\n plain language of the Contract and would needlessly delay\n the filing of claims for equitable price adjustments.\n                        CONCLUSION\n     We have considered Electric Boat\u2019s remaining argu-\n ments and find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing rea-\n sons, we conclude that the Board correctly determined that\n the statute of limitations barred Electric Boat\u2019s claim and\n therefore affirm the Board\u2019s decision.\n                        AFFIRMED\n      No Costs.\n\n\n\n\n      4   The Board rejected Electric Boat\u2019s argument that\n its claim did not accrue until June 2007, when it allegedly\n had the information necessary to assert its claim. J.A. 13.\n The Board determined that the accrual of Electric Boat\u2019s\n claim was not suspended between August 2005 and June\n 2007, while Electric Boat gathered the information it\n deemed necessary to calculate its projected costs. J.A. 13.\n Because Electric Boat does not challenge this determina-\n tion on appeal, it has waived any argument that its claim\n did not accrue until it could calculate the \u201csum certain\u201d of\n its incurred costs.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">Case: 19-1621     Document: 42    Page: 1   Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n   United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Federal Circuit\n                   ______________________\n\n          ELECTRIC BOAT CORPORATION,\n                    Appellant\n\n                             v.\n\n                SECRETARY OF THE NAVY,\n                          Appellee\n                   ______________________\n\n                         2019-1621\n                   ______________________\n\n     Appeal from the Armed Services Board of Contract Ap-\n peals in No. 58672, Administrative Judge David D\u2019Alessan-\n dris, Administrative Judge J.

Because the\n Board correctly held that Electric Boat\u2019s claim is barred by\n the statute of limitations, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     On August 14, 2003, Electric Boat and the Navy en-\n tered into a contract (the Contract) for the construction of\n up to six separate Virginia-class nuclear-powered subma-\n rines (SSNs), SSN 778 through SSN 783. 1 The Contract\n established a target price for each submarine, comprising\n the sum of the target cost and the target profit. See J.A. 84\n (SSN 783). Electric Boat was entitled to periodic progress\n payments proportional to Electric Boat\u2019s overall construc-\n tion progress. J.A. 271\u201379 (Clause H-29). The Navy was\n required to fully compensate Electric Boat under the Con-\n tract until Electric Boat\u2019s invoiced costs exceeded\n\n\n     1    The Contract between Electric Boat and the Navy\n funded full construction of only the first submarine, SSN\n 778.

J.A. 281 (Clause\n H-30(d)).

It provides that:\n     (b) If, at any time after the effective date of this\n     contract, a New Federal Law is enacted or a change\n     is made to a Currently Applicable Federal Law or\n     a New Federal Law or regulations thereunder\n     promulgated by Federal authorities, and compli-\n     ance with such new law or change directly results\n     in an increase or decrease in the Contractor\u2019s cost\n     of performance of this contract, the contract\n     price(s) shall be adjusted . . . .

Electric Boat\u2019s injury under the\n Contract was the enactment of the OSHA Regulation, the\n compliance with which Electric Boat contends directly in-\n creased its costs of performance by more than $125,000 per\n\fCase: 19-1621    Document: 42      Page: 7    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY                      7\n\n\n\n submarine. See J.A. 453. Because the OSHA Regulation\n became effective in December 2004, the Navy\u2019s liability for\n a price adjustment became fixed under the Contract on Au-\n gust 15, 2005, when Clause H-30 first provides a right to a\n price adjustment. See J.A. 280. The Board correctly deter-\n mined that the Navy\u2019s liability was fixed, and therefore\n Electric Boat\u2019s claim accrued, on August 15, 2005, more\n than six years before Electric Boat filed its claim. See 48\n C.F.R. \u00a7 33.201.\n     Electric Boat contends that its claim for costs did not\n accrue until May 2, 2011 when the Navy\u2019s Contracting Of-\n ficer denied its request for a price adjustment. It argues\n that it was not injured under the Contract until it received\n notice of the Navy\u2019s intent to not adjust the contract price.\n Citing our decision in Kellogg Brown, Electric Boat argues\n that the Board therefore erroneously determined that the\n procedures required by the Change-of-Law Clause did not\n delay accrual of Electric Boat\u2019s claims. We do not agree.\n      Although \u201cthe limitations period does not begin to run\n if a claim cannot be filed because mandatory pre-claim pro-\n cedures have not been completed,\u201d the contract here did not\n require that Electric Boat undertake any such procedures.\n See Kellogg </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brown,</span> <span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">628</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The Contract here, however, expressly states that re-\n quests for price adjustments under the Change-of-Law\n Clause \u201cshall be made in accordance with the procedures of\n the requirement entitled \u2018DOCUMENTATION OF\n REQUESTS FOR EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT.\u2019\u201d J.A.\n 281 (Clause H-30(e)). The Contract therefore required that\n Electric Boat follow the standard equitable adjustment\n procedures set forth in Clause H-9 of the Contract. See J.A.\n 228, J.A. 334.      Although the Change-of-Law Clause\n\fCase: 19-1621     Document: 42     Page: 8    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                       ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY\n\n\n\n\n required Electric Boat to \u201cpromptly notify\u201d the Navy of a\n qualifying change in law, Electric Boat was not required to\n await a unilateral Navy price adjustment prior to filing a\n claim. See J.A. 281. Indeed, Electric Boat\u2019s injury under\n Clause H-30 of the contract was the enactment of the\n OSHA Regulation, not the Navy\u2019s refusal to adjust the\n price. 3 That the Navy did not formally refuse to adjust the\n price until May 2, 2011 therefore does not excuse Electric\n Boat\u2019s failure to timely file a claim in compliance with the\n CDA and the plain language of the Contract. See J.A. 228;\n see also J.A. 334 (incorporating by reference the FAR\u2019s\n standard Disputes Clause).\n                             II.\n     Electric Boat argues two alternative theories of partial\n timeliness. First, Electric Boat contends that its claim is\n timely as to five of the six submarines, SSN 779 through\n SSN 783, because Electric Boat\u2019s costs for these subma-\n rines did not exceed the target price until after December\n 19, 2006 (the Critical Date). Because its claims did not ex-\n ceed the target price, Electric Boat argues that it was being\n fully compensated and therefore had no claim for equitable\n adjustment for these submarines until after the Critical\n Date. Electric Boat\u2019s contention is unavailing.\n\n\n\n\n     3    Electric Boat\u2019s complaint alleged two counts of re-\n lief: one count for an entitlement to a price adjustment and\n the other count for breach of contract arising from the\n Navy\u2019s May 2, 2011 denial of Electric Boat\u2019s request for ad-\n justment. J.A. 75. Electric Boat waived any argument of\n timeliness under common law breach of contract principles\n by failing to argue before the Board that its injury arose\n from the Navy\u2019s alleged breach of contract on May 2, 2011.\n See J.A. 14 (identifying Electric Boat\u2019s alleged first date of\n actual injury as December 15, 2006).\n\fCase: 19-1621    Document: 42      Page: 9    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY                      9\n\n\n\n      Electric Boat was not required to incur actual costs for\n each submarine before filing a claim for equitable adjust-\n ment under the Contract. Instead, when Electric Boat\u2019s\n claim accrued in August 2005, Electric Boat had six years\n to file a claim for an equitable adjustment to the contrac-\n tual price terms, including the target cost for each subma-\n rine. See J.A. 280. That the Navy made progress payments\n to Electric Boat as required by Clause H-29 of the Contract\n does not excuse Electric Boat\u2019s untimeliness as to any of\n the six submarines. See J.A. 271\u201379 (Clause H-29). The\n Navy\u2019s payment of scheduled progress payments does not\n amount to agreement that Electric Boat is entitled to in-\n creased actual costs. There was an express provision under\n the contract for seeking such increased costs\u2014equitable\n adjustment.\n     Second, Electric Boat contends that its claims are\n timely as to the last two submarines, SSN 782 and SSN\n 783, because the Navy did not authorize funds for Electric\n Boat to begin construction on the final two ships until De-\n cember 28, 2006 and January 10, 2008, respectively. Be-\n cause Clause H-20 of the Contract made Electric Boat\u2019s\n performance contingent upon funding, Electric Boat argues\n it could not have known the \u201csum certain\u201d of additional\n costs that it would incur for these submarines until after\n the Critical Date. This contention is also unavailing.\n      Clause H-20 of the Contract merely provides that Elec-\n tric Boat\u2019s expenditure for each fiscal year is contingent on\n the appropriation of funds. J.A. 245. It establishes that\n Electric Boat was not authorized to make expenditures or\n incur obligations in excess of the amounts that the Con-\n tracting Officer had specified as available for performance.\n J.A. 245. Clause H-20 does not, however, make Congres-\n sional appropriation a condition precedent for seeking a\n price adjustment for each submarine. Thus, while Electric\n Boat was precluded from incurring actual costs in the hull\n construction of the final two submarines until funding had\n been approved, it was not precluded from filing a claim for\n\fCase: 19-1621     Document: 42    Page: 10    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                     ELEC. BOAT CORP. v. SEC\u2019Y OF THE NAVY\n\n\n\n\n adjusted target costs for these two submarines under\n Clause H-30. 4 We therefore reject Electric Boat\u2019s second\n theory of partial timeliness, which runs counter to the\n plain language of the Contract and would needlessly delay\n the filing of claims for equitable price adjustments.\n                        CONCLUSION\n     We have considered Electric Boat\u2019s remaining argu-\n ments and find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing rea-\n sons, we conclude that the Board correctly determined that\n the statute of limitations barred Electric Boat\u2019s claim and\n therefore affirm the Board\u2019s decision.\n                        AFFIRMED\n      No Costs.\n\n\n\n\n      4   The Board rejected Electric Boat\u2019s argument that\n its claim did not accrue until June 2007, when it allegedly\n had the information necessary to assert its claim. J.A. 13.\n The Board determined that the accrual of Electric Boat\u2019s\n claim was not suspended between August 2005 and June\n 2007, while Electric Boat gathered the information it\n deemed necessary to calculate its projected costs. J.A. 13.\n Because Electric Boat does not challenge this determina-\n tion on appeal, it has waived any argument that its claim\n did not accrue until it could calculate the \u201csum certain\u201d of\n its incurred costs.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/208042/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/782028/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4535276/", "id": 4535276, "absolute_url": "/opinion/4754929/esip-series-2-llc-v-puzhen-life-usa-llc/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/4754929/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "date_created": "2020-05-19T16:00:35.094046Z", "date_modified": "2020-05-19T16:36:32.945023Z", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "883ce734f03203944342d1fd53ff2b473dffc81d", "page_count": 12, "download_url": "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1659.Opinion.5-19-2020_1590336.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2020/05/19/esip_series_2_llc_v._puzhen_life_usa_llc.pdf", "plain_text": "Case: 19-1659    Document: 36    Page: 1   Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n   United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Federal Circuit\n                 ______________________\n\n                  ESIP SERIES 2, LLC,\n                       Appellant\n\n                            v.\n\n                PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC,\n                        Appellee\n                 ______________________\n\n                       2019-1659\n                 ______________________\n\n     Appeal from the United States Patent and Trademark\n Office, Patent Trial and Appeal Board in No. IPR2017-\n 02197.\n                  ______________________\n\n                 Decided: May 19, 2020\n                 ______________________\n\n    GORDON K.

The \u2019130 Patent\n     ESIP Series 2, LLC, (\u201cESIP\u201d) owns U.S. Patent\n No. 9,415,130 (\u201cthe \u2019130 patent\u201d), which relates to \u201ca novel\n system and method for combining germicidal protection\n and aromatic diffusion in enclosed habitable spaces.\u201d \u2019130\n patent at 1:7\u201310. Products of this type are commonly\n known as \u201cvaporizers\u201d or \u201cdiffusers.\u201d Figure 2 of the \u2019130\n patent, shown below, depicts an embodiment of the claimed\n invention with a diffusion module (45) contained within a\n housing (12).\n\n\n\n\n     The \u2019130 patent states that it overcomes \u201ca number of\n problems\u201d in the prior art that stem from the diffusion of\n\fCase: 19-1659     Document: 36      Page: 3    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC                   3\n\n\n\n \u201c[o]verly large particles.\u201d \u2019130 patent at 4:15\u201328. It teaches\n that overly large particles cause waste and reduce effec-\n tiveness: \u201crather than remaining in the air until they have\n evaporated or been incorporated into the atmosphere, they\n may instead settle out relatively quickly, onto surfaces, fur-\n niture, floors, into HVAC systems, or the like.\u201d Id.\n     To avoid these problems, the claimed invention recites\n \u201ca micro-cyclone for quiet, well diffused flow of ultra-fine\n droplets.\u201d \u2019130 patent at 4:15\u201328. Figure 12, shown below,\n depicts components of the diffusion module (45), including:\n a \u201creservoir\u201d (52), an \u201catomizer\u201d (46), and a \u201cmicro-cyclone\u201d\n (90). The micro-cyclone contains a \u201cspiral channel\u201d (91)\n that \u201cbegins below a central plane . . . defined by a plate\u201d\n (96). Id. at 16:57\u201317:4. The micro-cyclone causes \u201cthe com-\n paratively larger particles in the stream of air . . . to smash\n and coalesce against the inside of the outer wall of the [spi-\n ral] channel,\u201d leaving only \u201cthe comparatively smallest\n range of droplets [to be] passed out to the nozzle.\u201d Id.\n at 17:26\u201331. After coalescing, the larger droplets \u201cdrip\n back into the atomizer . . . to be re-atomized.\u201d Id.\n\fCase: 19-1659     Document: 36     Page: 4     Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                   ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC\n\n\n\n\n    Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed in-\n vention:\n       1. A method for introducing a scent into breath-\n     able air, the method comprising;\n         providing a system comprising a reservoir,\n           eductor, and separator operably con-\n           nected to one another;\n         providing a liquid constituting an aromatic\n           substance selected by an operator for the\n           scent to be introduced into the breathable\n           air;\n         drawing a first portion of the liquid from\n           the reservoir by the eductor passing a\n           flow of air;\n         entraining the first portion of the liquid\n           into the flow;\n         forming droplets of the first portion by at\n           least one of restricting an area through\n           which the flow passes and the entraining;\n         separating out a second distribution of\n           the droplets by passing the flow through\n           a wall between a first chamber and a sec-\n           ond chamber, the flow path spiraling ax-\n           ially        and        circumferentially,\n           simultaneously       and     continuously,\n           through an arcuate channel formed\n           through the wall; and passing a first\n           distribution of the droplets out of the sep-\n           arator into the breathable air.\n \u2019130 patent at 23:22\u201341 (emphases added).\n                     B. IPR Proceeding\n     Puzhen Life USA, LLC, (\u201cPuzhen\u201d) filed a petition for\n inter partes review of claims 1, 3, and 17 of the \u2019130 patent.\n\fCase: 19-1659     Document: 36      Page: 5   Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC                 5\n\n\n\n Puzhen challenged the claims as obvious (i) in view of Sevy 1\n and Cronenberg 2; and (ii) in view of Sevy and Giroux 3.\n     Sevy relates to \u201cnovel systems and methods for inte-\n grating air supplies, reservoirs and atomizers into an inte-\n grated system.\u201d Sevy at 1:6\u20138. Sevy relies on \u201cdirection\n change and momentum of impact to further comminute []\n droplets into a more finely atomized mist.\u201d Id. at 2:13\u201319.\n Sevy teaches that larger droplets are separated from the\n mist because they \u201ccannot move with the airflow, typically\n because . . . they will not be able to quickly turn to follow\n the flow of air.\u201d Id. at 8:64\u20139:4.\n     Cronenberg relates to \u201c[a] separator adapted for use as\n part of a fluid dispenser system for supplying inhalable flu-\n ids.\u201d Cronenberg at Abstract. Cronenberg teaches that the\n \u201cseparator is adapted to be positioned within the fluid dis-\n penser system so that the mixture of liquid and gas passes\n along [a] tortuous passageway,\u201d causing \u201cthe larger drop-\n lets of liquid [to be] removed from the mixture.\u201d Id. at\n 2:48\u201355. In this way, the separator \u201cachieve[s] the desired\n vapor and avoid[s] the presence of liquid droplets in the gas\n and liquid mixture.\u201d Id. at 1:20\u201322.\n      Giroux relates to \u201ca novel integrated nebulizer and par-\n ticle dispersion chamber\u201d that \u201cprovides for delivery of a\n vortical flow of nebulized particles to the nostrils.\u201d Giroux\n at Abstract. To achieve the size and velocity characteris-\n tics that are important for effective drug delivery, Giroux\n teaches forcing the particles to flow through a \u201cbaffle\u201d that\n is in a \u201cgenerally serpentine or helix shape,\u201d which \u201ccre-\n ate[s] motion of the nebulized particles in a vortex as they\n exit the dispersion chamber.\u201d Id. at 13:32\u201342.\n\n\n\n\n     1   U.S. Patent No. 7,878,418 (\u201cSevy\u201d).\n     2   U.S. Patent No. 4,243,396 (\u201cCronenberg\u201d).\n     3   U.S. Patent No. 8,001,963 (\u201cGiroux\u201d).\n\fCase: 19-1659    Document: 36     Page: 6    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                  ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC\n\n\n\n\n     Based on the prior art and expert testimony, the Board\n determined that the challenged claims would have been ob-\n vious in view of Sevy and Cronenberg and in view of Sevy\n and Giroux. J.A. 40, 47. The Board found that Sevy dis-\n closes every element of the challenged claims except for the\n \u201carcuate channel\u201d limitation of the \u201cseparating\u201d claim ele-\n ment. J.A. 23\u201331. The Board found that both Cronenberg\n and Giroux disclose the \u201carcuate channel\u201d limitation. The\n Board explained:\n     [N]either reference, considered by itself, teaches\n     forming an arcuate channel through a wall for the\n     purpose of separating liquid droplets out of a mixed\n     air-droplet flow. Sevy\u2019s separator passes flow\n     through a wall, but not using an arcuate passage-\n     way. Cronenberg [and Giroux] teach[] accomplish-\n     ing the same type of separation using an arcuate\n     passageway, but not one passing through a wall.\n J.A. 27, 43. The Board determined that a skilled artisan\n would have been motivated to combine the teachings of\n each reference with Sevy to arrive at the claimed invention.\n     The Board also addressed in its final written decision\n ESIP\u2019s argument that Puzhen\u2019s petition was barred from\n institution because Puzhen failed to identify \u201call real par-\n ties in interest\u201d as required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(a)(2).\n J.A. 849. According to ESIP, Puzhen\u2019s petition failed to\n identify two real parties in interest: doTERRA Interna-\n tional, LLC, and Puzhen Life Co., Ltd. J.A. 5. After con-\n sidering ESIP\u2019s asserted evidence, the Board determined\n that neither party was a real party in interest within the\n meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(a)(2) and that Puzhen\u2019s petition\n was not barred from institution. J.A. 11, 14.\n                          ANALYSIS\n     Obviousness is a question of law with underlying fac-\n tual findings relating to the scope and content of the prior\n art; differences between the prior art and the claims at\n\fCase: 19-1659     Document: 36      Page: 7   Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v.

Persion Pharms. LLC\n v. Alvogen Malta Operations Ltd., 945 F.3d 1184, 1189\n (Fed. Cir. 2019). We review factual determinations for sub-\n stantial evidence. Id. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch rele-\n vant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Consol. Edison Co. v.\n NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938). We review the Board\u2019s\n legal conclusions de novo. Velander v. Garner, 348\n F.3d 1359, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n                       A. Obviousness\n    ESIP challenges four fact findings underlying the\n Board\u2019s conclusion that the \u2019130 patent claims would have\n been obvious. We determine that all four fact findings are\n supported by substantial evidence, and we affirm the\n Board\u2019s conclusion.\n      First, with respect to the \u201cseparating\u201d claim limitation,\n ESIP challenges the Board\u2019s finding that Sevy teaches sep-\n arating droplets by passing the flow through an orifice in a\n wall. Appellant Br. 27\u201328. ESIP argues that Sevy\u2019s ori-\n fice\u2014aperture 99, shown in Figure 7 below\u2014\u201cdoes not\n function as a separator\u201d because it \u201ccannot discriminate\n with regard to the size of a particle passing through it. It\u2019s\n a hole.\u201d Id. at 28. We disagree. In support of its finding,\n the Board relied on Sevy\u2019s disclosure that \u201cseparator plate\n 98 passes the flow of air from the atomizer 16 through ap-\n ertures 99\u201d and that droplets with \u201ctoo large a size and\n mass will not be able to quickly turn to follow the flow of\n air, and will strike the walls of the opening 100 or the sep-\n arator plate 98.\u201d J.A. 26 (citing Sevy at 8:64\u20139:2). The\n Board also relied on the testimony of Puzhen\u2019s expert, Mr.\n Smith, who testified that the separator plate (98) in Sevy\n \u201csegregate[s]\u201d atomizer droplets. Id. (citing J.A. 634\u2013635).\n\fCase: 19-1659    Document: 36     Page: 8    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                  ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC\n\n\n\n\n     We find no error in the Board\u2019s decision to credit the\n opinion of one expert over another, and we do not reweigh\n evidence on appeal. Impax Labs. Inc. v. Lannett Holdings\n Inc., 893 F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Substantial ev-\n idence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Sevy teaches sep-\n arating droplets by passing the flow through an orifice in a\n wall.\n\n     Second, also with respect to the \u201cseparating\u201d claim lim-\n itation, ESIP challenges the Board\u2019s finding that Giroux\n discloses a \u201cvortex\u201d that separates large droplets from the\n air flow. ESIP argues that the circulation of particles\n through Giroux\u2019s \u201cvortex\u201d \u201cdoes not result in the larger\n droplets being separated from the vortex or separated from\n the air flow.\u201d Appellant Br. at 35. For support, ESIP cites\n only the testimony of its expert, Dr. Bell, which the Board\n found to be \u201cconclusory and unsupported\u201d and thus \u201cun-\n helpful and unpersuasive.\u201d J.A. 29. In support of its find-\n ing that Giroux\u2019s vortex separates large droplets from the\n\fCase: 19-1659     Document: 36      Page: 9    Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC                   9\n\n\n\n airflow, the Board relied on the expert testimony of Mr.\n Smith and Giroux\u2019s teaching that the swirl of droplets in\n Giroux\u2019s \u201cvortex\u201d \u201csends the larger droplets to the outside\n rings and . . . keeps the smaller [] droplets in the air stream\n for a longer period of time.\u201d J.A. 43 (quoting Giroux\n at 8:60\u201362, 12:33-37; J.A. 643\u2013644). Substantial evidence\n therefore supports the Board\u2019s finding that Giroux teaches\n a vortex that separates larger droplets from the air flow.\n See Impax, 893 F.3d at 1382.\n\n      Third, ESIP challenges the Board\u2019s finding that a\n skilled artisan would have been motivated to replace the\n aperture in Sevy with the arcuate passageway of Cronen-\n berg. The Board found that Sevy and Cronenberg teach\n two alternative methods for achieving the separation of\n droplets from the mixed droplet-air flow, and that a skilled\n artisan would have been motivated to substitute one\n method for the other. J.A. 26\u201327. ESIP argues that Sevy\n and Cronenberg \u201cachieve different results\u201d and that combi-\n nation of these two references would require \u201csubstantial\n reconstruction.\u201d Appellant Br. 28\u201329. Again, ESIP relies\n solely on the discredited testimony of Dr. Bell. In reaching\n its finding, the Board relied on the disclosures of Sevy and\n Cronenberg, and the expert testimony of Mr. Smith, who\n testified that a skilled artisan \u201cwould [have] replace[d]\n [Sevy\u2019s] aperture(s) in plate 98 with the helical pathway of\n Cronenberg.\u201d J.A. 26 (citing Sevy at 8:64\u20139:2; Cronenberg\n at 3:12\u201321, 5:37\u201343; J.A. 634\u2013635). Substantial evidence\n therefore supports the Board\u2019s finding that a skilled arti-\n san would be motivated to combine Sevy and Cronenberg.\n See Impax, 893 F.3d at 1382.\n     Fourth, ESIP challenges the Board\u2019s finding that a\n skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine Sevy\n with Giroux. Appellant Br. 36. ESIP asserts that the\n Board \u201cfailed to articulate the required explication as to\n why Giroux\u2019s helical baffle would be \u2018formed through a\n wall\u2019 as required by the subject claims.\u201d Id. We disagree.\n The Board found that \u201cboth Sevy and Giroux teach\n\fCase: 19-1659    Document: 36     Page: 10     Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                  ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC\n\n\n\n\n methods for removing large droplets from [the] mixture of\n air and liquid droplets,\u201d and thus a skilled artisan would\n have been motivated to \u201csubstitute a channel defined by a\n helical baffle, as taught by Giroux, for the straight orifice\n in Sevy\u2019s plate.\u201d J.A. 44\u201345. In reaching that determina-\n tion, the Board relied on the disclosures of Sevy and\n Giroux, and the expert testimony of Mr. Smith, who testi-\n fied that a skilled artisan \u201cwould have had a reason to com-\n bine the teachings of Sevy with those of Giroux.\u201d Id. (citing\n Sevy at 8:64\u20139:2; Giroux at 8:60\u201362, 12:33\u201337; J.A. 643\u2013\n 644). Substantial evidence therefore supports the Board\u2019s\n finding that a skilled artisan would be motivated to com-\n bine Sevy and Giroux. See Impax, 893 F.3d at 1382.\n      ESIP also argues that the Board committed numerous\n legal errors when rendering its obviousness determination.\n For example, ESIP claims that the Board legally erred by\n failing to expressly define the applicable level of ordinary\n skill in the art. Appellant Br. 19\u201320. Yet ESIP fails to\n make the requisite showing that there are \u201cany meaningful\n differences\u201d between the parties proposed definitions or\n that \u201cthe outcome of [the] case would have been different\n based on which definition the Board used.\u201d Genzyme Ther-\n apeutic Prod. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Biomarin Pharm. Inc., 825\n F.3d 1360, 1371\u201372 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Similarly, ESIP chal-\n lenges the Board\u2019s construction of \u201cwall,\u201d yet ESIP \u201cfail[s]\n to clearly explain what result would occur if this court\n adopted [the appellant\u2019s] proposed claim construction[].\u201d\n Fresenius USA, Inc. v. Baxter Int\u2019l, Inc., 582 F.3d 1288,\n 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that the appellant \u201cgave this\n court little guidance and cited no record support regarding\n why a modified claim construction would affect the [judg-\n ment]. For that reason alone, we may decline to consider\n Fresenius\u2019s claim construction arguments.\u201d). We find\n ESIP\u2019s arguments unpersuasive.\n     Because the Board\u2019s obviousness conclusion is not le-\n gally erroneous and the fact findings are supported by sub-\n stantial evidence, we affirm the determination that\n\fCase: 19-1659     Document: 36      Page: 11     Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC                   11\n\n\n\n claims 1, 3, and 17 would have been obvious in view of Sevy\n and Cronenberg and in view of Sevy and Giroux.\n                   B. Real Party in Interest\n      Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(a), a petition \u201cmay be considered\n only if\u201d it includes: (1) payment of fees; (2) identification of\n all real parties in interest; (3) identification \u201cwith particu-\n larity\u201d of each claim challenged, the grounds of each chal-\n lenge, and the supporting evidence; (4) other information\n the Director requires by regulation; and (5) copies of these\n documents for the patent owner. ESIP argues that Puzhen\n failed to identify all \u201creal parties in interest\u201d and thus the\n Board erred when it considered institution of inter partes\n review.      For the reasons stated below, the Board\u2019s\n \u00a7 312(a)(2) real-party-in-interest determination is final\n and non-appealable.\n      In Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC v. Lee, 136 S. Ct. 2131\n (2016), the Supreme Court held that this Court is pre-\n cluded from reviewing Board decisions concerning the \u201cpar-\n ticularity\u201d requirement under \u00a7 312(a)(3). The Court\n explained that \u00a7 314(d) bars appellate review of \u201cquestions\n that are closely tied to the application and interpretation\n of statutes related to the Patent Office\u2019s decision to initiate\n inter partes review.\u201d Id. at 2141\u201342. The Court further\n explained that \u201cwhere a patent holder grounds its claim in\n a statute closely related to that decision to institute inter\n partes review, \u00a7 314(d) bars judicial review.\u201d Id.\n     More recently, in Thryv, Inc v. Click-To-Call Techs.,\n LP, 140 S. Ct. 1367 (2020), the Supreme Court held that\n \u00a7 314(d) also precludes judicial review of the agency\u2019s deci-\n sion whether to apply the one-year time bar set forth in\n \u00a7 315(b)). The Court explained that \u201c\u00a7 315(b)\u2019s time limita-\n tion is integral to, indeed a condition on, institution,\u201d and\n that \u201ca contention that a petition fails under \u00a7 315(b) is a\n contention that the agency should have refused \u2018to institute\n an inter partes review.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1373\u201374 (quoting 35 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 314(d)). The Court concluded that a challenge to a\n\fCase: 19-1659    Document: 36      Page: 12     Filed: 05/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                  ESIP SERIES 2, LLC v. PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC\n\n\n\n\n petition\u2019s timeliness under \u00a7 315(b) raises \u201can ordinary dis-\n pute about the application of\u201d an institution-related stat-\n ute and is barred from appellate review by \u00a7 314(d). Id.\n     In view of Cuozzo and Click-to-Call, we find no princi-\n pled reason why preclusion of judicial review under\n \u00a7 314(d) would not extend to a Board decision concerning\n the \u201creal parties in interest\u201d requirement of \u00a7 312(a)(2).\n ESIP\u2019s contention that the Board failed to comply with\n \u00a7 312(a)(2) is \u201ca contention that the agency should have re-\n fused to institute an inter partes review.\u201d See Click-To-\n Call, 140 S. Ct. at 1373\u201374. Indeed, ESIP expressly argues\n that the agency should have refused to institute inter\n partes review because of Puzhen\u2019s failure to identify all\n \u201creal parties in interest.\u201d E.g., Appellant Br. at 5 (\u201c[I]t was\n improper for the Board to \u2018consider\u2019 the IPR Petition and\n institute an IPR.\u201d). Accordingly, we hold that ESIP\u2019s chal-\n lenge to the Board\u2019s \u201creal parties in interest\u201d determination\n \u201craises \u2018an ordinary dispute about the application of\u2019 an in-\n stitution-related statute,\u201d and that \u00a7 314(d) precludes our\n review of that determination.

PUZHEN LIFE USA, LLC\n\n\n\n\n     Based on the prior art and expert testimony, the Board\n determined that the challenged claims would have been ob-\n vious in view of Sevy and Cronenberg and in view of Sevy\n and Giroux. J.A. 40, 47. The Board found that Sevy dis-\n closes every element of the challenged claims except for the\n \u201carcuate channel\u201d limitation of the \u201cseparating\u201d claim ele-\n ment. J.A. 23\u201331. The Board found that both Cronenberg\n and Giroux disclose the \u201carcuate channel\u201d limitation. The\n Board explained:\n     [N]either reference, considered by itself, teaches\n     forming an arcuate channel through a wall for the\n     purpose of separating liquid droplets out of a mixed\n     air-droplet flow. Sevy\u2019s separator passes flow\n     through a wall, but not using an arcuate passage-\n     way. Cronenberg [and Giroux] teach[] accomplish-\n     ing the same type of separation using an arcuate\n     passageway, but not one passing through a wall.\n J.A. 27, 43. The Board determined that a skilled artisan\n would have been motivated to combine the teachings of\n each reference with Sevy to arrive at the claimed invention.\n     The Board also addressed in its final written decision\n ESIP\u2019s argument that Puzhen\u2019s petition was barred from\n institution because Puzhen failed to identify \u201call real par-\n ties in interest\u201d as required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(a)(2).\n J.A. 849. According to ESIP, Puzhen\u2019s petition failed to\n identify two real parties in interest: doTERRA Interna-\n tional, LLC, and Puzhen Life Co., Ltd. J.A. 5. After con-\n sidering ESIP\u2019s asserted evidence, the Board determined\n that neither party was a real party in interest within the\n meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(a)(2) and that Puzhen\u2019s petition\n was not barred from institution.

We determine that all four fact findings are\n supported by substantial evidence, and we affirm the\n Board\u2019s conclusion.\n      First, with respect to the \u201cseparating\u201d claim limitation,\n ESIP challenges the Board\u2019s finding that Sevy teaches sep-\n arating droplets by passing the flow through an orifice in a\n wall. Appellant Br. 27\u201328. ESIP argues that Sevy\u2019s ori-\n fice\u2014aperture 99, shown in Figure 7 below\u2014\u201cdoes not\n function as a separator\u201d because it \u201ccannot discriminate\n with regard to the size of a particle passing through it.

Substantial ev-\n idence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Sevy teaches sep-\n arating droplets by passing the flow through an orifice in a\n wall.\n\n     Second, also with respect to the \u201cseparating\u201d claim lim-\n itation, ESIP challenges the Board\u2019s finding that Giroux\n discloses a \u201cvortex\u201d that separates large droplets from the\n air flow. ESIP argues that the circulation of particles\n through Giroux\u2019s \u201cvortex\u201d \u201cdoes not result in the larger\n droplets being separated from the vortex or separated from\n the air flow.\u201d Appellant Br. at 35. For support, ESIP cites\n only the testimony of its expert, Dr. Bell, which the Board\n found to be \u201cconclusory and unsupported\u201d and thus \u201cun-\n helpful and unpersuasive.\u201d J.A. 29.

The Board found that Sevy and Cronenberg teach\n two alternative methods for achieving the separation of\n droplets from the mixed droplet-air flow, and that a skilled\n artisan would have been motivated to substitute one\n method for the other. J.A. 26\u201327. ESIP argues that Sevy\n and Cronenberg \u201cachieve different results\u201d and that combi-\n nation of these two references would require \u201csubstantial\n reconstruction.\u201d Appellant Br. 28\u201329. Again, ESIP relies\n solely on the discredited testimony of Dr. Bell. In reaching\n its finding, the Board relied on the disclosures of Sevy and\n Cronenberg, and the expert testimony of Mr. Smith, who\n testified that a skilled artisan \u201cwould [have] replace[d]\n [Sevy\u2019s] aperture(s) in plate 98 with the helical pathway of\n Cronenberg.\u201d J.A. 26 (citing Sevy at 8:64\u20139:2; Cronenberg\n at 3:12\u201321, 5:37\u201343; J.A. 634\u2013635).

In re Van\n Os, 844 F.3d 1359, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \u201cObviousness is\n a question of law based on underlying facts\u201d such as the\n scope and content of the prior art. Arctic Cat Inc. v. Bom-\n bardier Recreational Prods. Inc., 876 F.3d 1350, 1358 (Fed.\n Cir. 2017).\n       I.       Claims 1, 3\u20138, 10\u201314, and 16\u201320\n                1. \u201clistening for . . . telemetry\u201d\n     The Board construed \u201ctelemetry\u201d as the \u201ctransmission\n of data or information . . . in the form of a transmission of\n energy (power).\u201d J.A. 18. It clarified that \u201ctelemetry does\n not include an unmodulated transmission of energy\n (power).\u201d Id. Under this construction, the Board found\n that Torgerson \u2019883\u2019s disclosure of a charging circuit receiv-\n ing telemetry from a telemetry signal teaches the claimed\n step of listening for the second type of telemetry. J.A. 42\u2013\n 43.\n     Boston Scientific argues that the Board erred in con-\n struing \u201ctelemetry\u201d and what it means to \u201clisten[] for . . .\n telemetry,\u201d and therefore that substantial evidence does\n not support the Board\u2019s finding. While Boston Scientific\n agrees with the Board that \u201ctelemetry\u201d means \u201cdata or in-\n formation,\u201d it contends that \u201clistening for . . . telemetry\u201d\n means that \u201ca specialized receiver is ready to receive data\n or information transmitted to it from a specialized trans-\n mitter.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 36. Boston Scientific did not pro-\n pose a construction for, and the Board did not separately\n construe, \u201clistening for . . . telemetry.\u201d\n     Nevro contends that Boston Scientific waived any\n claim construction argument as to \u201clistening for . . . telem-\n etry\u201d by failing to raise it before the Board. We agree. The\n Board construed \u201ctelemetry\u201d in its Institution Decision,\n providing Boston Scientific ample opportunity to offer a\n\fCase: 19-1584      Document: 71       Page: 5   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n BOSTON SCIENTIFIC   v.

The Board\u2019s Institution Decision also prelimi-\n narily determined that Torgerson \u2019883 discloses a \u201csecond\n telemetry from an external charging component . . .\u201d under\n its construction. The Board\u2019s finding in its Final Written\n Decision that Torgerson \u2019883\u2019s charging circuit teaches \u201clis-\n tening for a second type of telemetry\u201d by \u201cdraw[ing] energy\n (power)       from     the    modulated      electromagnetic\n waves . . . transmitted to it\u201d was therefore not an unex-\n pected construction of \u201clistening for telemetry\u201d as Boston\n Scientific contends. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 9 (citing J.A. 42\u2013\n 43, 48\u201349). Accordingly, we hold that Boston Scientific\n waived any claim construction argument as to \u201clistening\n for . . . telemetry\u201d and we do not address the parties\u2019 argu-\n ments as to the construction of this term or whether sub-\n stantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding under\n Boston Scientific\u2019s proposed construction.\n      Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that\n Torgerson \u2019883 discloses listening for a second type of te-\n lemetry under the Board\u2019s construction. J.A. 41. Figure 2\n of Torgerson \u2019883 \u201cillustrates that a telemetry signal 10 in-\n teracts directly with a charging circuit 20 and a controller\n 90.\u201d J.A. 1144 at 5:18\u201320. Torgerson \u2019883 further discloses\n that \u201c[t]he telemetry signal 10 also interacts with the con-\n troller 90 to deliver and receive patient and device data.\u201d\n Id. at 5:23\u201324. Thus, the signal in Torgerson \u2019883 meets\n the Board\u2019s construction that the telemetry signal include\n data (e.g., modulated electromagnetic waves). J.A. 42\u201343.\n As the Board found, \u201c[t]he fact that charging circuit 20\n draws energy (power) from the modulated electromagnetic\n waves that make for the \u2018telemetry\u2019 signals does not change\n the fact that it uses the \u2018telemetry\u2019 signals transmitted to\n it.\u201d J.A. 43.\n                2. \u201ctype of telemetry\u201d\n     The Board found that Torgerson \u2019756 discloses a telem-\n etry unit that listens for a first type of telemetry from an\n\fCase: 19-1584    Document: 71      Page: 6    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                           BOSTON SCIENTIFIC   v. NEVRO CORP.\n\n\n\n external physician programmer and patient programmer.\n The Board further found that \u201cTorgerson \u2019756 covers the\n use of a second type of telemetry for battery charging oper-\n ations.\u201d J.A. 39 (emphasis in original). Boston Scientific\n argues that the latter finding is not supported by substan-\n tial evidence. It contends that Torgerson \u2019756 discloses\n only one type of telemetry\u2014inductive telemetry\u2014and\n therefore Torgerson \u2019756 does not disclose a second type of\n telemetry.\n     Torgerson \u2019756 discloses a telemetry unit that listens\n for a first type of telemetry. Nevro argues that Torgerson\n \u2019756\u2019s recharge module, which uses \u201cother communication\n techniques\u201d to communicate with an external charger, uses\n a second type of telemetry. The recharge module comprises\n a recharge regulation control unit that \u201ccommunicates with\n [an] external component via telemetry unit 305.\u201d J.A. 1129\n at 7:41\u201345; J.A. 1130 at 9:46\u201347. Torgerson \u2019756 further\n discloses the implementation of \u201cother communication\n techniques\u201d where \u201crecharge regulation control unit 525\n communicates with the external component by modulating\n the load on the recharge coil[, which] can then be sensed in\n the circuitry driving the source coil of the external compo-\n nent.\u201d J.A. 1130 at 9:48\u201353. There is nothing in the \u2019241\n patent specification that precludes this communication\n technique from constituting a second \u201ctype of telemetry\u201d\n merely because it is not a different type of energy transfer\n modality. Indeed, Boston Scientific\u2019s expert, Dr. Ronald\n Berger testified that \u201cit is the modulation of the electro-\n magnetic wave that makes it a telemetry link.\u201d J.A. 1416\n \u00b6 33. Dr. Berger also testified that \u201cit is possible that the\n Torgerson \u2019756 may use two types of telemetry . . . for the\n internal device to communicate outward to the external de-\n vice.\u201d J.A. 1317 at 140:17\u201320. We therefore hold that sub-\n stantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the\n recharge regulation control unit employs a second type of\n telemetry to communicate the change in load to the exter-\n nal component.

Combination of Torgerson References\n      Boston Scientific argues that substantial evidence does\n not support the Board\u2019s finding that a skilled artisan would\n have been motivated to modify Torgerson \u2019198 and Torg-\n erson \u2019756 in view of Torgerson \u2019883 to create a device that\n listens for two types of telemetry. We do not agree. As\n discussed above, Torgerson \u2019756 discloses the implementa-\n tion of \u201cother communication techniques\u201d where \u201crecharge\n regulation control unit 525 communicates with the exter-\n nal component.\u201d J.A. 1130 at 9:48\u201353. It further discloses\n that when \u201cthe power source 315 is almost depleted of en-\n ergy, the power source 315 may not have sufficient energy\n to provide the feedback control\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe exter-\n nal component may deliver an initial large burst of energy\n to \u2018wake up\u2019 the power source 315 and the recharge module\n 310.\u201d J.A. 1129 at 8:62\u201367. Dr. Berger stated that the\n wake up burst in Torgerson \u2019756 \u201cmay be the same wake\n up burst\u201d as the one in Torgerson \u2019883. J.A. 1321 at 144:8\u2013\n 16. We therefore agree with the Board that \u201c[g]iven that\n Torgerson \u2019883 employs a telemetry technique to deliver a\n \u2018wake up\u2019 burst, which Torgerson \u2019756 also discloses and is\n perhaps the same \u2018wake up\u2019 burst, . . . adequate motivation\n has been provided for a POSA to look to Torgerson \u2019883 for\n another technique (involving telemetry) to deliver a \u2018wake\n up\u2019 burst with respect to the charging component of Torg-\n erson \u2019756.\u201d J.A. 50.\n     Accordingly, we hold that the Board did not err in hold-\n ing that claims 1, 3\u20138, 10\u201314, and 16\u201320 would have been\n obvious over the combined teachings of Torgerson \u2019198,\n Torgerson \u2019756, and Torgerson \u2019883.\n                      II.

Abrahamson discloses the use of FSK and OOK\n telemetry units. J.A. 1156 at 1:14\u201321 (\u201cIn RF coupled sys-\n tems, . . .

Nevro\u2019s expert, Dr.\n Mark Kroll, declared that \u201ca POSA would have chosen the\n FSK modulation scheme for the communication between\n the telemetry module 305 and an external device for pro-\n gramming the INS 14 because FSK provides a higher band-\n width and thus a higher capacity to transmit useful\n information.\u201d J.A. 1021 \u00b6 181. He further testified that \u201ca\n POSA would have chosen the OOK modulation scheme for\n communication between the recharge module 310 and an\n external device used for charging the INS 14 because that\n communication is typically simpler and can be fully\n achieved with the simpler OOK modulation scheme.\u201d Id.\n     Accordingly, we conclude that the Board did not err in\n holding that claims 2, 9, and 15 would have been obvious\n in view of the combined teachings of Torgerson \u2019198, Torg-\n erson \u2019756, Torgerson \u2019883, and Abrahamson.\n                         CONCLUSION\n     We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments\n and do not find them persuasive.

Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 9 (citing J.A. 42\u2013\n 43, 48\u201349). Accordingly, we hold that Boston Scientific\n waived any claim construction argument as to \u201clistening\n for . . . telemetry\u201d and we do not address the parties\u2019 argu-\n ments as to the construction of this term or whether sub-\n stantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding under\n Boston Scientific\u2019s proposed construction.\n      Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that\n Torgerson \u2019883 discloses listening for a second type of te-\n lemetry under the Board\u2019s construction.

Nevro argues that Torgerson\n \u2019756\u2019s recharge module, which uses \u201cother communication\n techniques\u201d to communicate with an external charger, uses\n a second type of telemetry. The recharge module comprises\n a recharge regulation control unit that \u201ccommunicates with\n [an] external component via telemetry unit 305.\u201d J.A. 1129\n at 7:41\u201345; J.A. 1130 at 9:46\u201347.

SRAM, LLC\n\n\n\n\n    Before LOURIE, MAYER, and WALLACH, Circuit Judges.\n LOURIE, Circuit Judge.\n      Fox Factory, Inc., appeals from a final written decision\n of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d), holding\n claims 1\u201326 of U.S. Patent 9,291,250 (the \u201c\u2019250 patent\u201d) not\n unpatentable as obvious. Fox Factory, Inc. v. SRAM, LLC,\n No. IPR2017-01440, (P.T.A.B. Dec. 6, 2018), Paper 62 (\u201cDe-\n cision\u201d). Because the Board\u2019s fact findings are supported\n by substantial evidence and its conclusion of nonobvious-\n ness is correct, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n      The parties to this appeal, Fox Factory and SRAM,\n LLC, are competitors in the bicycle market. Over the past\n decade, SRAM has introduced several improvements in bi-\n cycle design that have enabled it to market bicycles with a\n solitary chainring (the \u201cX-Sync chainring\u201d), a set-up previ-\n ously thought to be too arduous for all but a few bicyclists.\n The solitary chainring set-up does not require the roller\n chain to switch between chainrings when the rider shifts\n gears, so the chainring can be optimized to fit snugly into\n the roller chain. In particular, a conventional roller chain\n has chain links that are alternatingly narrow and wide, so\n SRAM designed a chainring to have a standard set of teeth\n and a widened set to fit into the link spaces. SRAM\u2019s X-\n Sync chainring has been extensively praised for its chain\n retention even in trying conditions. J.A. 5682\u201383.\n     SRAM has received numerous patents for its inven-\n tions relating to bicycles. The \u2019250 patent discloses that the\n standard bicycle chain has alternating inner and outer\n links, and the outer links have a much wider space in the\n center. Yet conventional chainrings have teeth that are the\n same size; thus, the teeth fit too loosely into the outer link\n spaces. The \u2019250 patent proposes a single chainring with\n alternating teeth, one conventional set that fits the inner\n\fCase: 19-1544      Document: 51          Page: 3   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOX FACTORY, INC.   v. SRAM, LLC                                3\n\n\n\n chain links and one widened set that fits the outer chain\n links\u2014specifically disclosing that the widened set should\n fill 75% or more of the width of the outer chain links. Claim\n 1 is illustrative:\n     1. A bicycle chainring of a bicycle crankset for en-\n     gagement with a drive chain, comprising:\n     a plurality of teeth extending from a periphery of\n     the chainring wherein roots of the plurality of teeth\n     are disposed adjacent the periphery of the chain-\n     ring;\n     the plurality of teeth including a first group of teeth\n     and a second group of teeth, each of the first group\n     of teeth wider than each of the second group of\n     teeth; and\n     at least some of the second group of teeth arranged\n     alternatingly and adjacently between the first\n     group of teeth,\n     wherein the drive chain is a roller drive chain in-\n     cluding alternating outer and inner chain links de-\n     fining outer and inner link spaces, respectively;\n     wherein each of the first group of teeth is sized and\n     shaped to fit within one of the outer link spaces and\n     each of the second group of teeth is sized and\n     shaped to fit within one of the inner link spaces;\n     and\n     wherein a maximum axial width about halfway be-\n     tween a root circle and a top land of the first group\n     of teeth fills at least 80 percent of an axial distance\n     defined by the outer link spaces.\n \u2019250 patent col. 6 l. 50\u2013col. 7 l. 4.\n      SRAM asserted the \u2019250 patent, along with its parent,\n U.S. Patent 9,182,027 (the \u201c\u2019027 patent\u201d), against Fox Fac-\n tory and its subsidiary, Race Face Performance Products,\n in the United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\n trict of Illinois. See SRAM, LLC v. Race Face Performance\n\fCase: 19-1544    Document: 51      Page: 4   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                               FOX FACTORY, INC.   v. SRAM, LLC\n\n\n\n Prods., No. 1-15-cv-11362 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 17, 2015), ECF No.\n 1; SRAM, LLC v. Race Face Performance Prods., No. 1-16-\n cv-05262 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 17, 2015), ECF No. 1. The \u2019027 pa-\n tent also claims a bicycle chainring where every other tooth\n is widened, but the claims do not specify the degree to\n which these teeth are widened, and they also require the\n teeth to be offset.\n     Fox Factory petitioned for inter partes review of the\n \u2019250 and \u2019027 patents on the ground of obviousness. In the\n \u2019250 patent IPR, Fox Factory cited a Japanese patent pub-\n lication, JP S56-42489 (\u201cShimano\u201d), and U.S. Patent\n 3,375,022 (\u201cHattan\u201d). Shimano was laid open in 1981 and\n teaches a bicycle chainring with widened teeth to fit into\n the outer chain links of a conventional roller chain. J.A.\n 951\u201352. Hattan describes an elliptical chainring and dis-\n closes that the chainring\u2019s teeth should fill between 74.6%\n and 96% of the inner chain link space. Id. col. 7 ll. 52\u201365.\n Fox Factory contended that the \u2019250 patent claims would\n have been obvious because a skilled artisan would have\n seen the utility in designing a chainring with widened\n teeth to improve chain retention, as taught by Shimano,\n and he would have looked to Hattan\u2019s teaching that the\n chainring teeth should fill between 74.6% and 96% of the\n chain link space.\n     In the \u2019027 patent IPR, the Board held the challenged\n claims not unpatentable as obvious. Fox Factory, Inc. v.\n SRAM, LLC, 2018 WL 1889561, at *21 (P.T.A.B. Apr. 18,\n 2018). We vacated the Board\u2019s decision because it applied\n the wrong legal standard for evaluating the relevance of\n secondary considerations to obviousness. Fox Factory, Inc.\n v. SRAM, LLC, 944 F.3d 1366, 1373\u201378 (Fed. Cir. 2019).\n We noted the inconsistency of SRAM\u2019s arguing, in the \u2019027\n and \u2019250 patent IPRs, for the nonobviousness of each pa-\n tent based upon the same secondary considerations evi-\n dence. See id. at 1378 (\u201cThe same evidence of secondary\n considerations cannot be presumed to be attributable to\n two different combinations of features.\u201d (citing Therasense,\n\fCase: 19-1544     Document: 51      Page: 5   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOX FACTORY, INC.   v.

Becton, Dickinson & Co., 593 F.3d 1289, 1299 (Fed.\n Cir. 2010))).\n      Meanwhile, in the \u2019250 patent IPR, the Board rejected\n Fox Factory\u2019s obviousness challenge, finding the claimed\n invention\u2019s \u201caxial fill limitation\u201d\u2014that the widened teeth\n \u201cfill[] at least 80 percent of [the width of] the outer link\n spaces\u201d at the midpoint of the tooth\u2014unmet by any of Fox\n Factory\u2019s evidence. The Board found instead that Hattan\n only taught filling between 74.6% and 96% of the width at\n the bottom of the tooth. Decision, slip op. at 34. The Board\n then found, after a thorough review of SRAM\u2019s evidence of\n secondary considerations, that SRAM\u2019s showing rebutted\n Fox Factory\u2019s argument that a skilled artisan nevertheless\n would have found it obvious to modify the chainring\u2019s teeth\n to meet the axial fill limitation. Id., slip op. at 68\u201371.\n    Fox Factory timely appealed. We have jurisdiction\n pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A).\n                           DISCUSSION\n     We review the Board\u2019s legal determinations de novo, In\n re Elsner, 381 F.3d 1125, 1127 (Fed. Cir. 2004), but we re-\n view the Board\u2019s factual findings underlying those deter-\n minations for substantial evidence, In re Gartside, 203 F.3d\n 1305, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2000). A finding is supported by sub-\n stantial evidence if a reasonable mind might accept the ev-\n idence as adequate to support the finding. Consol. Edison\n Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).\n     The sole issue presented in this appeal is obviousness.\n Obviousness is a question of law that \u201clends itself to several\n basic factual inquiries,\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co., 383\n U.S. 1, 17\u201318 (1966) (citing Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co. v.\n Supermarket Equip. Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 155 (1950)), in-\n cluding the scope and content of the prior art, the level of\n ordinary skill in the art, differences between the prior art\n and the claimed invention, and any relevant secondary con-\n siderations. Id. The Supreme Court has held that \u201ca\n\fCase: 19-1544     Document: 51      Page: 6   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                FOX FACTORY, INC.   v. SRAM, LLC\n\n\n\n patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious\n merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was, in-\n dependently, known in the prior art.\u201d KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Te-\n leflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007). Instead, there must\n have been \u201can apparent reason to combine the known ele-\n ments in the fashion claimed by the patent at issue.\u201d Id. at\n 417\u201318. Such a reason exists if the claimed invention\n \u201c\u2018simply arranges old elements with each performing the\n same function it had been known to perform\u2019 and yields no\n more than one would expect from such an arrangement.\u201d\n Id. (quoting Sakraida v. Ag-Pro, Inc., 425 U.S. 273, 285\n (1976)).\n     Fox Factory argues that the Board\u2019s conclusion of non-\n obviousness is in error because the only difference between\n the prior art and the claimed invention is the degree to\n which the widened teeth should fill the outer chain link\n spaces, measured halfway up the tooth. Fox Factory fur-\n ther maintains that the Board misapplied our precedent on\n secondary considerations, erroneously granting SRAM a\n presumption of nexus between the claimed invention and\n evidence of the success of the X-Sync chainring. In partic-\n ular, Fox Factory argues that various unclaimed aspects of\n the X-Sync chainring, such as its tall, asymmetric, and\n hooked teeth, were the real driver of its success.\n     SRAM responds that Fox Factory failed to provide any\n prior art that rendered the axial fill limitation obvious to a\n skilled artisan. It further contends that the Board cor-\n rectly credited its evidence of secondary considerations be-\n cause it found that the X-Sync chainring\u2019s widened teeth\n were responsible for its success, and that is the novel fea-\n ture of the claimed chainring.\n     We agree with SRAM. While Fox Factory is correct\n that \u201ca mere change in proportion . . . involve[s] no more\n than mechanical skill,\u201d rather than the level of invention\n required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, Powers-Kennedy Contracting\n Corp. v. Conveying Co., 282 U.S. 175, 185 (1930), the Board\n\fCase: 19-1544    Document: 51       Page: 7   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOX FACTORY, INC.   v. SRAM, LLC                           7\n\n\n\n found that SRAM\u2019s optimization of the X-Sync chainring\u2019s\n teeth, as claimed in the \u2019250 patent, displayed significant\n invention. It based its conclusion on secondary considera-\n tions that strongly indicated that the X-Sync chainring\u2019s\n success surprised skilled artisans. Decision, slip op. at 51\u2013\n 59 (discussing industry skepticism and subsequent praise,\n and long-felt need to solve chain retention problem); see\n also J.A. 5682 (awarding \u201cInnovation of the Year\u201d to SRAM\n for the X-Sync chainring and noting that \u201cthe entire con-\n cept can be related in a single phrase\u2014[t]he chainring\u2019s\n teeth are shaped to match the widths of the chain links\u201d).\n The Board did not err in concluding that such evidence de-\n feated SRAM\u2019s contention of routine optimization.\n     We further reject Fox Factory\u2019s argument that our pre-\n vious decision on the \u2019027 patent necessarily requires vaca-\n tur here. In that case, this court held that the Board\n misapplied the legal requirement, incumbent upon patent\n owners, of showing a nexus between evidence of secondary\n considerations and the obviousness of the claims of that\n that patent\u2014in particular, the requirement that the prod-\n uct from which the secondary considerations arose is \u201cco-\n extensive\u201d with the claimed invention. Fox Factory, 944\n F.3d at 1373\u201378. Contrary to the Board\u2019s view, we reaf-\n firmed in that case that a product is not coextensive with a\n claimed invention simply because it falls within the scope\n of the claim.\n     In this IPR, SRAM argued to the Board that the >80%\n gap-filling aspect of the X-Sync chainring was crucial to its\n success. Given that concession, we concluded in our previ-\n ous Fox Factory opinion\u2014on the \u2019027 patent\u2014that no rea-\n sonable factfinder could decide that the X-Sync chainring\n was coextensive with a claim that made no mention of that\n feature. Id. at 1374 (\u201c[B]ecause the independent claims of\n the \u2019027 patent do not recite this >80% gap filling feature,\n the independent claims are not coextensive with the X-\n Sync chainrings.\u201d). Thus, we vacated the Board\u2019s decision\n in the \u2019027 patent IPR and remanded for the Board to\n\fCase: 19-1544     Document: 51      Page: 8     Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n8                                FOX FACTORY, INC.   v. SRAM, LLC\n\n\n\n address obviousness consistent with the law we have set\n forth on the presumption of nexus. Id. at 1380.\n       But the critical facts differ in this case\u2014most obviously\n in that the \u2019250 patent claims recite the >80% axial fill lim-\n itation. The unclaimed features that Fox Factory alleges\n contributed to the X-Sync chainring\u2019s success\u2014the general\n concept of narrow-wide teeth that existed in the art and the\n hooks and protrusions of the teeth on the X-Sync chain-\n ring\u2014are to some extent incorporated into the >80% axial\n fill limitation. See, e.g., Decision, slip op. at 43\u201344, 54. Fox\n Factory also does not attach any particular significance to\n the teeth offset feature claimed in the \u2019027 patent, and the\n record does not reflect that it was significant.\n     We conclude that, whether or not the Board properly\n allocated the burden of showing or rebutting nexus, sub-\n stantial evidence supports its findings on secondary consid-\n erations, particularly the skepticism and later praise of\n industry and long-felt need. We also conclude that sub-\n stantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination of\n nexus, based on its finding that the X-Sync chainring\u2019s suc-\n cess is largely due to its teeth profile, which is \u201cessentially\n the claimed invention,\u201d see Fox Factory, 944 F.3d at 1374,\n of the \u2019250 patent. On this record, it makes no difference\n that the patent owner chose to claim those innovations in\n terms of how much of the outer chain link space is filled by\n the widened teeth. In view of the Board\u2019s findings on sec-\n ondary considerations, we agree with its conclusion that\n the \u2019250 patent claims would not have been obvious.\n                          CONCLUSION\n     We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments\n but find them unpersuasive.

SRAM, LLC\n\n\n\n\n    Before LOURIE, MAYER, and WALLACH, Circuit Judges.\n LOURIE, Circuit Judge.\n      Fox Factory, Inc., appeals from a final written decision\n of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d), holding\n claims 1\u201326 of U.S. Patent 9,291,250 (the \u201c\u2019250 patent\u201d) not\n unpatentable as obvious. Fox Factory, Inc. v. SRAM, LLC,\n No. IPR2017-01440, (P.T.A.B. Dec. 6, 2018), Paper 62 (\u201cDe-\n cision\u201d). Because the Board\u2019s fact findings are supported\n by substantial evidence and its conclusion of nonobvious-\n ness is correct, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n      The parties to this appeal, Fox Factory and SRAM,\n LLC, are competitors in the bicycle market. Over the past\n decade, SRAM has introduced several improvements in bi-\n cycle design that have enabled it to market bicycles with a\n solitary chainring (the \u201cX-Sync chainring\u201d), a set-up previ-\n ously thought to be too arduous for all but a few bicyclists.\n The solitary chainring set-up does not require the roller\n chain to switch between chainrings when the rider shifts\n gears, so the chainring can be optimized to fit snugly into\n the roller chain. In particular, a conventional roller chain\n has chain links that are alternatingly narrow and wide, so\n SRAM designed a chainring to have a standard set of teeth\n and a widened set to fit into the link spaces. SRAM\u2019s X-\n Sync chainring has been extensively praised for its chain\n retention even in trying conditions. J.A. 5682\u201383.\n     SRAM has received numerous patents for its inven-\n tions relating to bicycles. The \u2019250 patent discloses that the\n standard bicycle chain has alternating inner and outer\n links, and the outer links have a much wider space in the\n center. Yet conventional chainrings have teeth that are the\n same size; thus, the teeth fit too loosely into the outer link\n spaces. The \u2019250 patent proposes a single chainring with\n alternating teeth, one conventional set that fits the inner\n\fCase: 19-1544      Document: 51          Page: 3   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOX FACTORY, INC.   v.

Claim\n 1 is illustrative:\n     1. A bicycle chainring of a bicycle crankset for en-\n     gagement with a drive chain, comprising:\n     a plurality of teeth extending from a periphery of\n     the chainring wherein roots of the plurality of teeth\n     are disposed adjacent the periphery of the chain-\n     ring;\n     the plurality of teeth including a first group of teeth\n     and a second group of teeth, each of the first group\n     of teeth wider than each of the second group of\n     teeth; and\n     at least some of the second group of teeth arranged\n     alternatingly and adjacently between the first\n     group of teeth,\n     wherein the drive chain is a roller drive chain in-\n     cluding alternating outer and inner chain links de-\n     fining outer and inner link spaces, respectively;\n     wherein each of the first group of teeth is sized and\n     shaped to fit within one of the outer link spaces and\n     each of the second group of teeth is sized and\n     shaped to fit within one of the inner link spaces;\n     and\n     wherein a maximum axial width about halfway be-\n     tween a root circle and a top land of the first group\n     of teeth fills at least 80 percent of an axial distance\n     defined by the outer link spaces.\n \u2019250 patent col. 6 l. 50\u2013col. 7 l. 4.\n      SRAM asserted the \u2019250 patent, along with its parent,\n U.S. Patent 9,182,027 (the \u201c\u2019027 patent\u201d), against Fox Fac-\n tory and its subsidiary, Race Face Performance Products,\n in the United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\n trict of Illinois.

The \u2019027 pa-\n tent also claims a bicycle chainring where every other tooth\n is widened, but the claims do not specify the degree to\n which these teeth are widened, and they also require the\n teeth to be offset.\n     Fox Factory petitioned for inter partes review of the\n \u2019250 and \u2019027 patents on the ground of obviousness. In the\n \u2019250 patent IPR, Fox Factory cited a Japanese patent pub-\n lication, JP S56-42489 (\u201cShimano\u201d), and U.S. Patent\n 3,375,022 (\u201cHattan\u201d).

Fox Factory fur-\n ther maintains that the Board misapplied our precedent on\n secondary considerations, erroneously granting SRAM a\n presumption of nexus between the claimed invention and\n evidence of the success of the X-Sync chainring.

We affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     On July 14, 2012, Carmen Lozano (\u201cLozano\u201d) gave\n birth to a baby girl at Community Memorial Hospital\n (\u201cCMH\u201d) in Ventura, California. The next day, while she\n was still hospitalized, Lozano received a tetanus-diphthe-\n ria-acellular-pertussis (\u201cTdap\u201d) vaccination. Two weeks\n later, on July 30, 2012, Lozano reported to Ventura County\n Obstetrics and Gynecology, complaining of a low-grade fe-\n ver, body aches, and breast tenderness. The nurse practi-\n tioner suspected that Lozano had early mastitis, and\n prescribed medication. Lozano\u2019s symptoms persisted and\n she began to experience fatigue.\n     On August 9, 2012, Lozano went to the emergency\n room with complaints of abdominal pain and difficulty uri-\n nating. After the laboratory tests showed no signs of infec-\n tion, she was discharged, but returned later that same day,\n reporting fever, weakness, loss of balance, vision changes,\n neck pain, headache, vomiting, and dizziness. A brain MRI\n revealed \u201cnumerous focal and patchy high signal intensity\n lesions involving the brainstem, cerebellopontine angles,\n right cerebellum, basal ganglia, corpus callosum and sub-\n cortical white matter,\u201d which suggested to the radiologist\n that Lozano possibly had multiple sclerosis (\u201cMS\u201d), acute\n disseminated encephalomyelitis (\u201cADEM\u201d), or vasculitis.\n Lozano, 2017 WL 3811124, at *1.\n\fCase: 19-2138      Document: 37   Page: 3   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n LOZANO   v. HHS                                          3\n\n\n\n     Lozano was admitted to the hospital for further evalu-\n ation, including a consultation with a neurologist, Dr.\n Francisco Torres. Dr. Torres opined that Lozano had pos-\n sibly experienced an MS attack, and began treating her\n with steroids. Lozano\u2019s symptoms improved after three\n days of treatment and she was discharged with a working\n diagnosis of MS. Lozano was instructed to follow up with\n Dr. Timothy Sheehy, who determined that a second opinion\n was necessary to ensure that her diagnosis was accurate.\n Before she could obtain that second opinion, however,\n Lozano returned to the emergency room with burning in\n her chest, slurred speech, hearing changes, and numbness\n in her tongue. She was diagnosed with an MS flare and\n discharged the same day. Lozano was instructed to see her\n primary care physician for an MRI of the spine. That MRI\n showed \u201c[p]atchy areas of altered signal intensity within\n the thoracic spinal cord . . . worrisome for foci of demye-\n lination.\u201d Id. at *2.\n     In September 2012, Lozano sought a second opinion\n from Dr. Barbara Giesser, a neurologist at the University\n of California Los Angeles Neurology Outpatient Clinic. Dr.\n Giesser provided a detailed medical history of Lozano since\n the onset of her symptoms in July 2012. Dr. Giesser\u2019s dif-\n ferential diagnosis included post-viral encephalitis/myeli-\n tis, with a working diagnosis of \u201cClinically Isolated\n Syndrome,\u201d a condition similar to MS. Id.\n     Throughout the fall of 2012, Lozano continued to see\n Dr. Sheehy, with complaints of a burning sensation from\n her back to chest and decreased memory, cognition, and de-\n pression. In February 2013, however, a repeat MRI\n \u201cshowed dramatic improvement, suggesting that ADEM\n was a more likely etiology, which was confirmed through\n later serological findings.\u201d Id. at *3. Since that time,\n Lozano\u2019s doctors have continued to opine that ADEM is the\n likely explanation for her symptoms. Id.\n\fCase: 19-2138    Document: 37     Page: 4    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n4                                              LOZANO   v. HHS\n\n\n\n     In April 2015, Lozano filed a petition for compensation\n under the Vaccine Act, alleging that she suffered ADEM as\n a result of the Tdap vaccine. Both parties submitted expert\n reports from neurologists as well as medical literature and\n prehearing briefing. In June 2017, the special master held\n an entitlement hearing, where both sides\u2019 experts testi-\n fied\u2014Dr. Norman Latov on behalf of Lozano and Dr.\n Thomas Leist for the government.\n     Dr. Latov opined that Lozano\u2019s ADEM was the result\n of her receipt of the Tdap vaccine. Id. He described ADEM\n \u201cas an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central\n nervous system that attacks the white matter of the brain\n and spinal cord of its patients.\u201d Id. Dr. Latov noted that\n ADEM can be confirmed through lesions on an MRI, and\n that \u201ca hallmark of ADEM is its subsequent resolution\u2014\n something that can be confirmed by later MRIs.\u201d Id. He\n also cited several pieces of medical literature observing an\n association between tetanus-containing vaccines and\n ADEM. Dr. Latov proposed that the Tdap vaccine trig-\n gered Lozano\u2019s autoimmune response, and noted that her\n treating physicians changed their diagnosis to ADEM after\n Lozano\u2019s \u201cMRIs cleared and she had experienced no subse-\n quent neurological episodes.\u201d Id. at *4.\n     Dr. Latov disputed the government\u2019s theory that\n Lozano was suffering from posterior reversible encephalo-\n pathy syndrome (\u201cPRES\u201d), rather than ADEM. In doing so,\n he explained that \u201cPRES is a condition marked by the pres-\n ence of edema in the posterior part of the brain as revealed\n on MRIs,\u201d and that the majority of patients with PRES\n have a \u201cdecreased level of consciousness and have sei-\n zures.\u201d Id. at *5. But Lozano\u2019s MRIs \u201cshowed lesions\n throughout the spinal cord and brain\u2014not just in the pos-\n terior region\u2014and detected no edema.\u201d Id. Nor had she\n experienced seizures or decreased consciousness. Given\n these factors, and because none of Lozano\u2019s treating physi-\n cians found that PRES was a reasonable explanation of her\n\fCase: 19-2138      Document: 37    Page: 5    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n LOZANO   v. HHS                                            5\n\n\n\n condition, Dr. Latov opined that PRES was an improper di-\n agnosis.\n     The government\u2019s expert\u2014Dr. Leist\u2014testified that\n Lozano had PRES and that it was not caused by the Tdap\n vaccine. Given the rapid onset of symptoms after she gave\n birth, Dr. Leist opined that PRES, a known vascular com-\n plication following pregnancy, was likely the correct diag-\n nosis. Although he recognized that none of Lozano\u2019s\n treating physicians considered PRES the proper diagnosis,\n Dr. Leist \u201copined that this was because her physicians had\n not given sufficient weight to the fact that she was post-\n partum\u201d when the symptoms began. Id. at *6.\n      Following the hearing, the special master granted\n Lozano\u2019s petition, finding that she was entitled to compen-\n sation. At the outset, the special master found that Dr. La-\n tov\u2019s testimony and the supporting medical literature\n demonstrated that the Tdap vaccine can cause autoim-\n mune diseases such as ADEM. Id. at *11. The special mas-\n ter then turned to the government\u2019s primary challenges\u2014\n that ADEM was not the correct diagnosis and that her\n symptoms began pre-vaccination. As to the first issue, the\n special master found that, although Lozano\u2019s treating phy-\n sicians initially included MS as part of the differential di-\n agnosis, \u201cher subsequent clinical progression ultimately\n led them away from MS and toward ADEM.\u201d Id. at *12.\n The special master expressly rejected the government\u2019s\n suggestion that Lozano\u2019s proper diagnosis was PRES, on\n grounds that \u201cthe overall record does not support it.\u201d Id.\n As to the second issue, the special master found that the\n government was unsuccessful in establishing that Lozano\n had symptoms potentially related to her ADEM pre-vac-\n cination. Finally, because Lozano experienced her symp-\n toms roughly 21 days after receiving the vaccine, the\n special master found that Lozano offered preponderant ev-\n idence of a proximate temporal relationship between the\n vaccine and her injury. Because Lozano carried her burden\n\fCase: 19-2138     Document: 37     Page: 6    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n6                                               LOZANO   v. HHS\n\n\n\n to show causation, the special master found that she was\n entitled to compensation under the Vaccine Act.\n     The government filed a motion for review of the special\n master\u2019s decision with the Court of Federal Claims. In rel-\n evant part, the government argued that the special master\n erred \u201cby failing to require evidence of a logical sequence of\n cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the rea-\n son for the injury.\u201d Lozano, 143 Fed. Cl. at 768. The Court\n of Federal Claims denied the motion, finding that the spe-\n cial master\u2019s decision was neither an abuse of discretion\n nor contrary to law, and that his fact findings were neither\n arbitrary nor capricious. Id. at 770. The Court of Federal\n Claims subsequently entered judgment, awarding dam-\n ages to Lozano in the form of a lump sum payment of\n $1,199,216.86.\n     The government timely appealed the Court of Federal\n Claims\u2019 final judgment to this court. We have jurisdiction\n under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(f).\n                         DISCUSSION\n      In Vaccine Act cases, we review the Court of Federal\n Claims\u2019 decision de novo, \u201capplying the same standard of\n review as the Court of Federal Claims applied to its review\n of the special master\u2019s decision.\u201d Griglock v. Sec\u2019y of Health\n & Human Servs., 687 F.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (ci-\n tation omitted); see also Paluck v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human\n Servs., 786 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2015). We owe no\n deference to the trial court or the special master on ques-\n tions of law, but we uphold the special master\u2019s findings of\n fact unless they are arbitrary or capricious. Griglock, 687\n F.3d at 1374 (citation omitted). \u201cWe \u2018do not sit to reweigh\n the evidence. [If] the Special Master\u2019s conclusion [is] based\n on evidence in the record that [is] not wholly implausible,\n we are compelled to uphold that finding as not being arbi-\n trary or capricious.\u2019\u201d Cedillo v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human\n Servs., 617 F.3d 1328, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting\n Lampe v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 219 F.3d 1357,\n\fCase: 19-2138      Document: 37    Page: 7    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n LOZANO   v.

Our role is not to \u201csecond guess the\n Special Master[\u2019]s fact-intensive conclusions,\u201d particularly\n in cases where \u201cthe medical evidence of causation is in dis-\n pute.\u201d Id. (quoting Hodges v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human\n Servs., 9 F.3d 958, 961 (Fed. Cir. 1993)).\n     The Vaccine Act distinguishes between two types of in-\n juries: \u201cTable\u201d and \u201coff-Table.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa\u2013\n 11(c)(1)(C)(i), 300aa\u201311(c)(1)(C)(ii). \u201cCausation is pre-\n sumed for Table injuries when a specified condition follows\n the administration of a specified vaccine within a specified\n period of time.\u201d Moriarty v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human\n Servs., 844 F.3d 1322, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citation omit-\n ted). All other injuries alleged to be caused by a vaccine\n are \u201coff-Table injuries,\u201d where the petitioner has to prove\n causation by a preponderance of the evidence. Althen v.\n Sec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed.\n Cir. 2005). It is undisputed that Lozano\u2019s injury is in the\n off-Table category, meaning that she must prove \u201cactual\n causation\u201d or \u201ccausation in fact\u201d by preponderant evidence.\n     To prove causation, a petitioner must show that the\n vaccine was \u201cnot only a but-for cause of the injury but also\n a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.\u201d Shyface\n v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 165 F.3d 1344, 1352\n (Fed. Cir. 1999). In doing so, the petitioner\u2019s burden:\n     is to show by preponderant evidence that the vac-\n     cination brought about her injury by providing:\n     (1) a medical theory causally connecting the vac-\n     cination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of\n     cause and effect showing that the vaccination was\n     the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a\n     proximate temporal relationship between vaccina-\n     tion and injury.\n Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278. Because the special master\n found, and the parties do not dispute, that Lozano satisfied\n the first and third prongs of the Althen test, only the second\n prong of Althen is at issue in this appeal.\n\fCase: 19-2138    Document: 37      Page: 8    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n8                                              LOZANO   v. HHS\n\n\n\n     The government\u2019s primary argument is that the special\n master and the Court of Federal Claims erred in finding\n that proof of a diagnosis, standing alone, suffices to prove\n causation in a non-Table case. According to the govern-\n ment, the special master ignored \u201cthe government\u2019s argu-\n ments regarding causation, and reliev[ed] petitioner of her\n burden to demonstrate not only that she suffers from\n ADEM, but also that the vaccine actually caused her\n ADEM.\u201d Appellant Br. 15. We disagree. As explained be-\n low, the special master fully addressed the parties\u2019 argu-\n ments and considered all of the record evidence in finding\n that Lozano established causation by preponderant evi-\n dence.\n      At the outset, although the government submits that\n the special master ignored its arguments, review of the rec-\n ord reveals that the special master specifically addressed\n the arguments the government raised in connection with\n Althen prong two. In its prehearing briefing to the special\n master, the government argued that Lozano failed to sat-\n isfy the second prong of Althen for two reasons: \u201cthe timing\n of petitioner\u2019s symptoms pre-date[d] the vaccine admin-\n istration; and the alternative diagnoses of petitioner\u2019s con-\n dition provide[d] an alternative explanation for why [she]\n experienced so many symptoms after vaccination.\u201d J.A.\n 111.\n     The special master began by addressing the govern-\n ment\u2019s arguments regarding diagnosis, finding that the\n medical evidence supported a diagnosis of ADEM and that\n none of Lozano\u2019s treating physicians had questioned that\n diagnosis since the winter of 2013. Lozano, 2017 WL\n 3811124, at *12. The special master next turned to the\n government\u2019s arguments regarding pre-vaccination symp-\n toms, finding that the government was \u201cunsuccessful in es-\n tablishing that Mrs. Lozano had symptoms potentially\n related to her ADEM that began pre-vaccination.\u201d Id. Fi-\n nally, the special master considered and rejected the\n\fCase: 19-2138      Document: 37    Page: 9    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n LOZANO   v. HHS                                             9\n\n\n\n government\u2019s argument that Lozano\u2019s proper diagnosis\n was PRES. Id.\n     In reaching these conclusions, the special master noted\n that he was addressing the government\u2019s PRES argument\n within his Althen prong two discussion \u201csince it relates di-\n rectly to the accuracy of the ADEM diagnosis, and was in\n fact offered to contradict it,\u201d but that he would reach the\n same conclusion if he had \u201cmore rigidly determined that\n [Lozano] had carried her initial burden, and then consid-\n ered (under the burden-shifting test applied) whether [the\n government] had carried [its] burden of establishing an al-\n ternative, unrelated cause for Mrs. Lozano\u2019s condition.\u201d Id.\n at *12, n.11. Accordingly, although he recognized that he\n was addressing issues in an unconventional order, the spe-\n cial master focused his analysis on the issues as the gov-\n ernment framed them, and expressly noted that his\n conclusion would have been the same had he structured his\n analysis differently.\n      In any event, the government\u2019s argument that the spe-\n cial master relied solely on Lozano\u2019s diagnosis to satisfy Al-\n then prong two is unfounded. Indeed, review of the special\n master\u2019s decision reveals that he considered the record as\n a whole in finding that Lozano \u201cestablished a logical se-\n quence of cause and effect from vaccine to injury that is\n supported by the evidentiary record.\u201d Id. at *12\u2013*13.\n     It is well established that petitioners need not present\n \u201cepidemiologic studies, rechallenge, the presence of patho-\n logical markers or genetic disposition, or general ac-\n ceptance in the scientific or medical communities to\n establish a logical sequence of cause and effect.\u201d Capizzano\n v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 440 F.3d 1317, 1325\n (Fed. Cir. 2006). Instead, we have explained that medical\n records and medical opinion testimony can satisfy Althen\n prong two, and that evidence used to satisfy one of the Al-\n then prongs can overlap to satisfy another prong. Id. at\n 1326.\n\fCase: 19-2138    Document: 37      Page: 10     Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                              LOZANO   v. HHS\n\n\n\n     We have also recognized that expert testimony is often\n very important in off-Table cases like this one, which re-\n quire proof of actual causation. Lampe v. Sec\u2019y of Health &\n Human Servs., 219 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (\u201cAs is\n often true in Vaccine Act cases based on a theory of actual\n causation, the expert medical testimony was important in\n this case.\u201d). Where both sides offer expert testimony, a spe-\n cial master\u2019s decision may be \u201cbased on the credibility of\n the experts and the relative persuasiveness of their com-\n peting theories.\u201d Broekelschen v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human\n Servs., 618 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citing Lampe,\n 219 F.3d at 1362). As such, the special master\u2019s credibility\n findings \u201care virtually unchallengeable on appeal.\u201d Id.\n     Here, the special master examined the medical records,\n medical literature, and both parties\u2019 expert reports and tes-\n timony. The record demonstrates that the special master\n was persuaded by Lozano\u2019s expert, Dr. Latov, who offered\n both written and oral testimony opining that Lozano\u2019s\n \u201cADEM was the product of her receipt of the Tdap vaccine.\u201d\n Lozano, 2017 WL 3811124, at *3. Based on the clinical\n signs and symptoms set forth in Lozano\u2019s medical records,\n Dr. Latov agreed with Lozano\u2019s treating neurologist, Dr.\n Sheehy, that she suffered from ADEM. Id. Dr. Latov ex-\n plained that ADEM typically develops days to weeks fol-\n lowing a triggering event, such as an infection or\n vaccination. See id. And he testified that it is well accepted\n in the medical community that tetanus-containing vaccina-\n tions, such as Tdap, can cause ADEM. Id. at *4. Given the\n record evidence that Lozano began to experience symptoms\n of ADEM roughly three weeks after her vaccination, cou-\n pled with the fact that no treating physician identified any\n alternative cause for her ADEM, Dr. Latov testified at the\n entitlement hearing that it was \u201chighly likely that [Lozano]\n had vaccine-induced ADEM.\u201d J.A. 226\u201328.\n      The government argues that Dr. Latov\u2019s expert analy-\n sis is insufficient to prove causation in light of our decision\n in Moberly v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 592 F.3d\n\fCase: 19-2138      Document: 37   Page: 11   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n LOZANO   v. HHS                                           11\n\n\n\n 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Specifically, the government main-\n tains that, in both Moberly and this case, experts found\n causation based solely on: (1) evidence that a vaccine can\n cause an injury; (2) proof that the petitioner developed an\n injury within the expected onset time after receiving that\n vaccination; and (3) a conclusion that there was no likely\n alternative cause. Appellant Br. 21 (citing Moberly, 592\n F.3d at 1320\u201321, 1323). According to the government, we\n rejected this evidence in Moberly on grounds that the peti-\n tioner failed to demonstrate actual causation, and we\n should do the same here. But in Moberly, the special mas-\n ter found the petitioner\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony \u201ccontradictory\n and confusing,\u201d and thus discredited his testimony on those\n grounds. 592 F.3d at 1320. Setting aside the expert testi-\n mony, the special master found, and we agreed, that the\n remaining evidence merely showed a temporal association\n between vaccine and injury, which was insufficient to\n demonstrate actual causation. Id. at 1323.\n     Here, however, Lozano\u2019s expert neurologist\u2014Dr. La-\n tov\u2014proffered testimony that was supported by peer-re-\n viewed, published medical literature, as well as Lozano\u2019s\n own medical records. Lozano, 2017 WL 3811124, at *11\u2013\n 12. Unlike Moberly, where the expert testimony was dis-\n credited, the special master here found Dr. Latov\u2019s testi-\n mony reliable and persuasive. Id. We see no reason to\n disturb that credibility determination on appeal. See\n Lampe, 219 F.3d at 1361\u201362. Because the evidence of rec-\n ord in Moberly was significantly different from the record\n in this case, the result in Moberly does not compel the same\n result here.\n     To the extent the government suggests that Lozano\n cannot satisfy Althen prong two because no treating physi-\n cian expressly opined that the Tdap vaccination caused her\n ADEM, we have made clear that \u201ctestimony from treating\n physicians is not required in Vaccine Act cases.\u201d Moberly,\n 592 F.3d at 1325. Given the testimony from Dr. Latov, cou-\n pled with the evidentiary record, the special master found\n\fCase: 19-2138    Document: 37     Page: 12   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                                            LOZANO   v. HHS\n\n\n\n that Lozano \u201cprovided sufficient preponderant evidence to\n meet her Althen Two burden. She established a logical se-\n quence of cause and effect from vaccine to injury that is\n supported by the evidentiary record.\u201d Lozano, 2017 WL\n 3811124, at *13. Because it is clear that he considered the\n record as a whole in reaching this conclusion, we agree with\n the Court of Federal Claims that the special master did not\n violate the bounds of his discretion and that his findings\n were neither arbitrary nor capricious. See Lozano, 143\n Fed. Cl. at 769.\n     We likewise agree with the Court of Federal Claims\n that, despite the government\u2019s suggestion to the contrary,\n this case neither creates a \u201cnew \u2018Table\u2019-type presumption\n for non-Table conditions,\u201d nor compromises \u201cthe scientific\n integrity of the Vaccine Program.\u201d Appellant Br. 22\u201323; see\n Lozano, 143 Fed. Cl. at 770 (rejecting the government\u2019s ar-\n guments that \u201ca de facto Table claim was created\u201d and that\n the special master\u2019s \u201copinion has put the integrity of the\n Vaccine Program at risk\u201d). On this record, there was suffi-\n cient evidence to support the special master\u2019s causation\n analysis, including his conclusion with respect to Althen\n prong two. We therefore decline the government\u2019s request\n to remand for reapplication of the Althen test.\n                        CONCLUSION\n      We have considered the government\u2019s remaining argu-\n ments and find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing rea-\n sons, we conclude that the special master applied the\n correct legal standard and considered the entire record in\n finding that Lozano proved causation by a preponderance\n of the evidence.

We affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     On July 14, 2012, Carmen Lozano (\u201cLozano\u201d) gave\n birth to a baby girl at Community Memorial Hospital\n (\u201cCMH\u201d) in Ventura, California. The next day, while she\n was still hospitalized, Lozano received a tetanus-diphthe-\n ria-acellular-pertussis (\u201cTdap\u201d) vaccination. Two weeks\n later, on July 30, 2012, Lozano reported to Ventura County\n Obstetrics and Gynecology, complaining of a low-grade fe-\n ver, body aches, and breast tenderness. The nurse practi-\n tioner suspected that Lozano had early mastitis, and\n prescribed medication. Lozano\u2019s symptoms persisted and\n she began to experience fatigue.\n     On August 9, 2012, Lozano went to the emergency\n room with complaints of abdominal pain and difficulty uri-\n nating. After the laboratory tests showed no signs of infec-\n tion, she was discharged, but returned later that same day,\n reporting fever, weakness, loss of balance, vision changes,\n neck pain, headache, vomiting, and dizziness. A brain MRI\n revealed \u201cnumerous focal and patchy high signal intensity\n lesions involving the brainstem, cerebellopontine angles,\n right cerebellum, basal ganglia, corpus callosum and sub-\n cortical white matter,\u201d which suggested to the radiologist\n that Lozano possibly had multiple sclerosis (\u201cMS\u201d), acute\n disseminated encephalomyelitis (\u201cADEM\u201d), or vasculitis.\n Lozano, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3811124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1.\n\fCase: 19-2138      Document: 37   Page: 3   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n LOZANO   v.

Dr. Torres opined that Lozano had pos-\n sibly experienced an MS attack, and began treating her\n with steroids. Lozano\u2019s symptoms improved after three\n days of treatment and she was discharged with a working\n diagnosis of MS. Lozano was instructed to follow up with\n Dr. Timothy Sheehy, who determined that a second opinion\n was necessary to ensure that her diagnosis was accurate.\n Before she could obtain that second opinion, however,\n Lozano returned to the emergency room with burning in\n her chest, slurred speech, hearing changes, and numbness\n in her tongue.

According to the govern-\n ment, the special master ignored \u201cthe government\u2019s argu-\n ments regarding causation, and reliev[ed] petitioner of her\n burden to demonstrate not only that she suffers from\n ADEM, but also that the vaccine actually caused her\n ADEM.\u201d Appellant Br. 15. We disagree. As explained be-\n low, the special master fully addressed the parties\u2019 argu-\n ments and considered all of the record evidence in finding\n that Lozano established causation by preponderant evi-\n dence.\n      At the outset, although the government submits that\n the special master ignored its arguments, review of the rec-\n ord reveals that the special master specifically addressed\n the arguments the government raised in connection with\n Althen prong two. In its prehearing briefing to the special\n master, the government argued that Lozano failed to sat-\n isfy the second prong of Althen for two reasons: \u201cthe timing\n of petitioner\u2019s symptoms pre-date[d] the vaccine admin-\n istration; and the alternative diagnoses of petitioner\u2019s con-\n dition provide[d] an alternative explanation for why [she]\n experienced so many symptoms after vaccination.\u201d J.A.\n 111.\n     The special master began by addressing the govern-\n ment\u2019s arguments regarding diagnosis, finding that the\n medical evidence supported a diagnosis of ADEM and that\n none of Lozano\u2019s treating physicians had questioned that\n diagnosis since the winter of 2013.

Indeed, review of the special\n master\u2019s decision reveals that he considered the record as\n a whole in finding that Lozano \u201cestablished a logical se-\n quence of cause and effect from vaccine to injury that is\n supported by the evidentiary record.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at *12\u2013*13.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">     It is well established that petitioners need not present\n \u201cepidemiologic studies, rechallenge, the presence of patho-\n logical markers or genetic disposition, or general ac-\n ceptance in the scientific or medical communities to\n establish a logical sequence of cause and effect.\u201d Capizzano\n v.

Specifically, the government main-\n tains that, in both Moberly and this case, experts found\n causation based solely on: (1) evidence that a vaccine can\n cause an injury; (2) proof that the petitioner developed an\n injury within the expected onset time after receiving that\n vaccination; and (3) a conclusion that there was no likely\n alternative cause.

The district court construed\n \u201cuser interface module\u201d as \u201ca component of the beverage\n dispenser that enables direct communication between a\n user and the dispenser.\u201d Rothschild Connected Devices In-\n novations, LLC v.

Nov. 13, 2017) (\u201cMarkman Opin-\n ion\u201d).\n     RCDI contended that the claim term should be con-\n strued as \u201ca component that enables communication be-\n tween a user and a dispenser.\u201d J.A. 458. The district court\n disagreed. The court noted that, unlike RCDI\u2019s proposed\n construction, the court\u2019s construction requires the user in-\n terface module to physically be a component of the bever-\n age dispenser.\u201d Id.\n      The court explained that \u201c[a] beverage dispenser \u2018com-\n prising\u2019 parts such as a mixing chamber, valves, and a user\n interface module is most naturally read to physically be\n made up of these different parts.\u201d Id. Moreover, the court\n reasoned, \u201cthe components of the system that are not phys-\n ically part of the dispenser, such as the network and the\n server, are not described by the claim to be parts that \u2018com-\n prise\u2019 the beverage dispenser. Instead, they are described\n in relation to the parts that are physically comprising the\n beverage dispenser.\u201d Id.; see also Summary Judgment\n Opinion, at 1182 n.96 (explaining that \u201c[a] component that\n is not inside of the casing of the dispenser, but nonetheless\n sits immediately outside of the dispenser and is connected\n by tubing\u2014such as the bag-in-a-box carton of high fructose\n corn syrup\u2014could reasonably be considered a physical\n component of the apparatus\u201d).

This motion turned on\n claim 11\u2019s limitation that the dispenser comprise \u201ca user\n interface module configured to receive an[] identity of a\n user and an identifier of the beverage.\u201d In RCDI\u2019s view,\n although a user might not be able to communicate his or\n her identity and beverage preferences to the dispenser via\n the Blister touchscreen, the Freestyle dispenser meets the\n claim limitation because the Blister\u2019s controller neverthe-\n less receives that information. More specifically, the user\u2019s\n phone initiates a process in which such information is sent\n to, among other components, the Blister interface\u2019s control-\n ler. Therefore, in RCDI\u2019s view, the Blister interface is con-\n figured to receive that information (albeit not via a user\u2019s\n interaction with the Blister interface itself), which is all\n that\u2019s required by claim 11.\n     The district court disagreed with RCDI and explained:\n     The \u201cuser interface module\u201d requirement is not sat-\n     isfied by any component that enables direct com-\n     munication between the user and the dispenser.\n     Instead, the direct communication must include\n     the user\u2019s identity and the beverage identifiers.\n     This is because the claim describes the module as\n     configured to receive an identity of a user and an\n     identifier of the beverage.\n Id. at 1189. In the district court\u2019s view, RCDI\u2019s infringe-\n ment theory\u2014that \u201ca user can communicate with the dis-\n penser via the internet by using the Freestyle app on a\n cellular phone\u201d\u2014involved indirect communication. Id. at\n 1190. As an initial matter, although \u201cphysically touching\n the [Blister] touchscreen interface is undoubtedly a form of\n \u2018direct communication,\u2019\u201d the court concluded that RCDI\n \u201chas not provided evidence that the Freestyle Dispenser\n\fCase: 19-1825     Document: 51     Page: 6    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6    ROTHSCHILD CONNECTED DEVICES      v.

Rather, the evidence established only \u201cthat a user\n can use the [Blister] touchscreen to choose a drink from a\n pre-selected list of beverage options.\u201d Id. Furthermore, the\n district court explained:\n     The specification describes several ways that a\n     user would directly communicate his or her iden-\n     tity to the user interface module, which is physi-\n     cally part of the dispenser. This identity can be\n     communicated, for example, by an RFID card, on a\n     magnetic swipe card, or by a code that is wirelessly\n     transferred from a cellular phone or mobile device\n     when such a device \u2018is within range of the dis-\n     penser.\u2019 [\u2019377 patent col. 7 ll. 31\u201338 (emphasis\n     added).] It then explains that communications\n     may be in the form of a keyboard, magnetic reader,\n     voice recognition, WiFi communication, RFID com-\n     munication, Bluetooth, or any other type of commu-\n     nication that may in the future be practiced.\n     However, given the previous descriptions of the\n     user interface module, it becomes clear that these\n     are direct communications with the dispenser, and\n     not communications over the Internet, cellular net-\n     work, or some other network. Thus, a user could\n     use Bluetooth technology to communicate directly\n     with the dispenser, or a local WiFi network to com-\n     municate directly with it. However, communica-\n     tions over the cellular network to a server would\n     not be direct.\n Id. at 1192.\n      Turning to the dependent claims, the court exercised\n its \u201cinherent authority to manage the affairs of its cases\u201d to\n \u201cpreclude [RCDI] from asserting any of the dependent\n claims,\u201d due to RCDI\u2019s \u201cconsistent refusal to identify the\n dependent claims that it would assert.\u201d Id. at 1178\u201379.\n\fCase: 19-1825    Document: 51       Page: 7   Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n ROTHSCHILD CONNECTED DEVICES      v.

RCDI\n contends that the district court erroneously construed the\n term \u201ca user interface module\u201d and that, under the proper\n construction, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judg-\n ment of noninfringement should be vacated.

Coca-Cola defends this construc-\n tion on appeal. RCDI asks us to instead construe the term\n to mean \u201ca component that enables communication be-\n tween a user and a dispenser.\u201d We disagree with both con-\n structions and construe \u201cuser interface module\u201d to mean \u201ca\n component the user interacts with to communicate with\n the dispenser.\u201d\n      RCDI\u2019s proposed construction reads out the term \u201cin-\n terface\u201d in \u201cuser interface module.\u201d Indeed, almost any\n component\u2014for example, a processor, or even a power\n cord\u2014can in its own way help to enable communication be-\n tween a user and a dispenser. But processors and power\n cords are not interfaces. Our interpretation gives proper\n meaning to the term interface by requiring the user inter-\n face module to be a component that the user interacts with\n to effectuate communication with the dispenser, not merely\n a component that enables such communication. 1\n\n\n\n\n     1  We note that, in its briefing, RCDI appears to ad-\n mit that a proper construction of \u201cuser interface module\u201d\n would be \u201cany interface the user interacts with to com-\n municate with the dispenser.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Reply 13\u2013\n 14.\n\fCase: 19-1825      Document: 51       Page: 9    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n ROTHSCHILD CONNECTED DEVICES        v.

Although the specifica-\n tion broadly defines the types of communication technolo-\n gies the user interface module can exploit, see, e.g., id. at\n col. 7 ll. 43\u201349, this does not negate the requirement that\n the user interface module be a component the user inter-\n acts with to communicate with the dispenser.\n     In addition to rejecting RCDI\u2019s proposed construction,\n we also reject the district court\u2019s claim construction.

The district court provided\n little explanation in its Markman opinion and order as to\n the precise meaning of \u201cdirect communication\u201d in the\n adopted construction. See Markman Opinion, at *5.

We agree.\n     As explained previously, claim 11 does not require the\n user interface module to enable \u201cdirect communication\u201d be-\n tween the user and the dispenser, at least as defined by the\n district court. Claim 11 does require that the user be able\n to interact with the user interface module to communicate\n with the dispenser. Indeed, the primary purpose of the\n user interface module is to facilitate the communication of\n information between the user and the device. See, e.g., \u2019377\n patent col. 6 l. 64\u2013col. 7 l. 4 (\u201cThe user interface module 416\n will enable communications between the user and dis-\n penser . . . .\u201d).

We agree.\n     The district court\u2019s analysis rests on a faulty premise:\n that RCDI consistently refused to identify the dependent\n claims it was asserting. In fact, on March 17, 2016\u2014fewer\n than five months into the case and before the case was\n transferred from the Southern District of Florida to the\n Northern District of Georgia\u2014RCDI disclosed the asserted\n dependent claims in its proposed amended complaint.

Indeed, on October 2016, after\n the case was transferred to the Northern District of Geor-\n gia, RCDI moved for a new schedule and status conference;\n in this motion, RCDI notified the court of RCDI\u2019s pending\n motion to amend the complaint and stated that \u201cthe pro-\n posed First Amended Complaint . . . specifically identifies\n the asserted dependent claims of the \u2019377 patent.\u201d J.A. 725.\n Subsequently, in response to Coca-Cola\u2019s interrogatory re-\n questing identification of the asserted claims, RCDI re-\n ferred to its identification of the asserted claims in the\n proposed amended complaint.

The district court\n disagreed.

This motion turned on\n claim 11\u2019s limitation that the dispenser comprise \u201ca user\n interface module configured to receive an[] identity of a\n user and an identifier of the beverage.\u201d In RCDI\u2019s view,\n although a user might not be able to communicate his or\n her identity and beverage preferences to the dispenser via\n the Blister touchscreen, the Freestyle dispenser meets the\n claim limitation because the Blister\u2019s controller neverthe-\n less receives that information. More specifically, the user\u2019s\n phone initiates a process in which such information is sent\n to, among other components, the Blister interface\u2019s control-\n ler. Therefore, in RCDI\u2019s view, the Blister interface is con-\n figured to receive that information (albeit not via a user\u2019s\n interaction with the Blister interface itself), which is all\n that\u2019s required by claim 11.\n     The district court disagreed with RCDI and explained:\n     The \u201cuser interface module\u201d requirement is not sat-\n     isfied by any component that enables direct com-\n     munication between the user and the dispenser.\n     Instead, the direct communication must include\n     the user\u2019s identity and the beverage identifiers.\n     This is because the claim describes the module as\n     configured to receive an identity of a user and an\n     identifier of the beverage.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1189. </span><pre class=\"inline\">In the district court\u2019s view, RCDI\u2019s infringe-\n ment theory\u2014that \u201ca user can communicate with the dis-\n penser via the internet by using the Freestyle app on a\n cellular phone\u201d\u2014involved indirect communication.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766699\"><a href=\"/opinion/766699/georgia-pacific-corporation-plaintiff-cross-v-united-states-gypsum/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span> at\n 1190. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">As an initial matter, although \u201cphysically touching\n the [Blister] touchscreen interface is undoubtedly a form of\n \u2018direct communication,\u2019\u201d the court concluded that RCDI\n \u201chas not provided evidence that the Freestyle Dispenser\n\fCase: 19-1825     Document: 51     Page: 6    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6    ROTHSCHILD CONNECTED DEVICES      v.

We agree.\n     As explained previously, claim 11 does not require the\n user interface module to enable \u201cdirect communication\u201d be-\n tween the user and the dispenser, at least as defined by the\n district court. Claim 11 does require that the user be able\n to interact with the user interface module to communicate\n with the dispenser. Indeed, the primary purpose of the\n user interface module is to facilitate the communication of\n information between the user and the device. See, e.g., \u2019377\n patent col. 6 l. 64\u2013col. 7 l. 4 (\u201cThe user interface module 416\n will enable communications between the user and dis-\n penser . . . .\u201d).

We agree.\n     The district court\u2019s analysis rests on a faulty premise:\n that RCDI consistently refused to identify the dependent\n claims it was asserting. In fact, on March 17, 2016\u2014fewer\n than five months into the case and before the case was\n transferred from the Southern District of Florida to the\n Northern District of Georgia\u2014RCDI disclosed the asserted\n dependent claims in its proposed amended complaint. J.A.\n 356; see also J.A. 348\u201358; J.A. 131\u201344. Although this mo-\n tion was not ruled on for many months, that delay was\n through no fault of RCDI. Indeed, on October 2016, after\n the case was transferred to the Northern District of Geor-\n gia, RCDI moved for a new schedule and status conference;\n in this motion, RCDI notified the court of RCDI\u2019s pending\n motion to amend the complaint and stated that \u201cthe pro-\n posed First Amended Complaint . . . specifically identifies\n the asserted dependent claims of the \u2019377 patent.\u201d J.A. 725.\n Subsequently, in response to Coca-Cola\u2019s interrogatory re-\n questing identification of the asserted claims, RCDI re-\n ferred to its identification of the asserted claims in the\n proposed amended complaint. J.A. 3920\u201322. Furthermore,\n in email correspondence in early 2018, RCDI yet again re-\n iterated that it was only asserting the claims identified in\n the proposed amended complaint, and further volunteered\n to \u201cstreamline\u201d the case by dropping some of those claims.\n J.A. 3831. On these facts, we disagree with the district\n court that RCDI refused to identify the asserted dependent\n claims, and we conclude that the district court abused its\n\fCase: 19-1825      Document: 51    Page: 14    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14       ROTHSCHILD CONNECTED DEVICES   v. COCA-COLA COMPANY\n\n\n\n discretion in dismissing the case as to the asserted depend-\n ent claims on this basis. 2\n                            CONCLUSION\n     We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments\n and find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing reasons, we\n reverse the district court\u2019s claim construction of \u201cuser in-\n terface module,\u201d vacate the district court\u2019s entry of sum-\n mary judgment of noninfringement, and remand for\n further proceedings. 3 RCDI raised a number of discovery-\n related issues on appeal. On remand, we expect that the\n district court will hold a new case management conference\n concerning discovery.\n   REVERSED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART, AND\n                 REMANDED\n                              COSTS\n      Costs to appellant.\n\n\n\n\n      2   Coca-Cola argues that any error by the district\n court is harmless because \u201cRCDI did not provide conten-\n tions for its dependent claims,\u201d and \u201c[o]n this basis,\u201d the\n district court \u201cwould have granted summary judgment of\n non-infringement for the dependent claims.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br.\n 42. We decline to resolve this dispute in the first instance\n and leave it for the district court to address on remand.\n     3    RCDI contends that, on remand, both the Blister\n touchscreen and the Freestyle app on a user\u2019s phone can\n each satisfy the \u201cuser interface module\u201d limitation. We\n note that, even under our construction, RCDI\u2019s phone app\n theory might present additional hurdles with regard to in-\n fringement. See, e.g., Centillion Data Sys., LLC v.

In March 2018, the District Court held a Mark-\n man hearing. J.A. 125\u201326. In July 2018, the District Court\n issued its Opinion, construing, among other terms, \u201c[t]he\n term \u2018bottom\u2019 in the \u2019518, \u2019626, and \u2019929 patents[,]\u201d Sandbox\n Logistics, 2018 WL 3344773, at *4, and \u201c[t]he term \u2018struc-\n tural support members\u2019 in the [\u2019]785 patent[,]\u201d id. at *15. 4\n Thereafter, SandBox and PropX stipulated to non-infringe-\n ment of the Asserted Claims by the Accused Products and\n the District Court entered the Final Judgment in favor of\n PropX.

The District Court Properly Construed the Term\n   \u201cBottom\u201d as Recited in the \u2019518, \u2019626, and \u2019929 Patents\n     The District Court concluded that a PHOSITA would\n understand the \u201cterm \u2018bottom\u2019 in the \u2019518, \u2019626, and \u2019929\n patents . . . to mean \u2018bottom wall[.]\u2019\u201d Sandbox Logistics,\n 2018 WL 3344773, at *4.

SandBox contends, however, that the District Court\u2019s\n construction \u201cmust be set aside\u201d as \u201c[i]ts rationale . . . re-\n lied entirely on its erroneous understanding that the\n claims require an \u2018ocean freight container\u2019 and on continu-\n ing to read in limitations from the specification.\u201d Appel-\n lant\u2019s Br. 68. We disagree with SandBox.\n      The District Court properly construed the term \u201cbot-\n tom\u201d as recited in the \u2019518, \u2019626, and \u2019929 patents. Con-\n sistent with claim construction principles, we look first to\n the language of the Asserted Claims, followed by the lan-\n guage of the specification and prosecution history. See\n Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314\u201317. Independent claim 1 of the\n \u2019518 patent, from which asserted claims 2 and 13 depend,\n recites, in relevant part, \u201ca container comprising[:] a cav-\n ity; sidewalls that define a lateral periphery of the cav-\n ity; . . . inclined surfaces that define a lower periphery of\n the cavity . . . ; a bottom; . . . [and] a hatch positioned\n closely adjacent to the bottom[.]\u201d \u2019518 patent col. 8 l. 57\u2013\n col. 9 l. 3. Similarly, independent claim 1 of the \u2019626 patent,\n from which asserted claim 6 depends, recites a \u201ccontainer\n comprising: a top; a bottom, having an outlet formed\n\fCase: 19-1684     Document: 53     Page: 8    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                SANDBOX LOGISTICS LLC   v.

Independent claim 13 of the \u2019626 patent, from\n which asserted claim 17 depends, likewise recites a \u201cfirst\n container having . . . a first outlet in a first bottom\u201d and a\n \u201csecond container . . . having a second outlet in a second\n bottom[.]\u201d Id. col. 11 ll. 4\u20137, 13\u201317. Finally, independent\n claim 1 of the \u2019929 patent, from which asserted claim 4 de-\n pends, and independent claim 7 of the \u2019929 patent, both re-\n cite, in relevant part, limitations materially identical to\n those recited in the \u2019626 patent. See \u2019929 patent col. 9\n ll. 14\u201345, col. 10 ll. 1\u201352.\n      While the claims do not shed much light on the appro-\n priate construction of \u201cbottom,\u201d the claims invariably re-\n quire that the \u201cbottom\u201d has an \u201coutlet\u201d or \u201chatch\u201d formed\n therein. Additionally, the juxtaposition of the terms \u201cbot-\n tom\u201d and \u201csidewalls\u201d throughout the claims indicates that\n \u201cbottom\u201d may refer to something other than a wall. See\n Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314 (\u201cDifferences among claims\n can . . . be a useful guide in understanding the meaning of\n particular claim terms.\u201d); cf. Fuji Photo Film Co. v. Int\u2019l\n Trade Comm\u2019n, 386 F.3d 1095, 1104\u201305 (Fed. Cir. 2004)\n (\u201cThe fact that . . . [a] limitation was included in the first\n step and omitted from the second and third steps provides\n strong textual support for [the] argument that the claim\n should be construed to distinguish between the first step\n and the other two.\u201d). Thus, while not dispositive, the\n claims seem to suggest that \u201cbottom\u201d may refer to a group\n of structures other than walls alone.\n     Turning to the broader specification, see Trs. of Colum-\n bia Univ. v.

SandBox contends, however,\n that \u201cnothing about the term \u2018structural support members\u2019\n requires that the claims\u2019 containers be \u2018ocean freight con-\n tainers.\u2019\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 53. Additionally, SandBox ar-\n gues that \u201c\u2018structural support members\u2019 does not refer\n solely to \u2018structural fortifications to the end walls and side-\n walls\u2019 of a container, much less require adding supports to\n an existing ocean freight container.\u201d Id. at 54. Rather, \u201cthe\n plain and ordinary meaning of \u2018structural support mem-\n bers\u2019 includes features in or of the wall itself[, ]e.g., a cor-\n rugated surface[].\u201d Id. (emphasis omitted). We disagree\n with SandBox.\n     The District Court properly construed the term \u201cstruc-\n tural support members\u201d as recited in the \u2019785 patent as\n \u201cstructural fortifications\u201d provided on an \u201cexisting\u201d con-\n tainer.

Independent claim 16 of the \u2019785 patent,\n from which asserted claims 18, 19, and 21\u201323 depend, re-\n cites materially identical limitations. See id. col. 18 ll. 27\u2013\n 64. That the \u201cstructural support members\u201d are recited sep-\n arately from the \u201cend walls\u201d and \u201cside walls\u201d implies that\n the \u201cstructural support members\u201d are a structurally dis-\n tinct component. See Becton, Dickinson & Co. v. Tyco\n Healthcare Grp., LP, 616 F.3d 1249, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 2010)\n (\u201cWhere a claim lists elements separately, the clear impli-\n cation of the claim language is that those elements are dis-\n tinct components of the patented invention.\u201d (internal\n quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted)); see\n HTC Corp. v. Cellular Commc\u2019ns Equip., LLC, 701 F. App\u2019x\n 978, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\u201cThe strongest evidence for this\n separation is the claim language itself, which plainly re-\n cites two different structures . . . . The separate naming of\n two structures in the claim strongly implies that the named\n entities are not one and the same structure.\u201d). Thus, the\n claim language supports the District Court\u2019s construction.\n      Turning to the broader specification, see Trs. of Colum-\n bia Univ., 811 F.3d at 1363, the \u2019785 patent discloses that\n a \u201cframe . . . provides structural support for the con-\n tainer . . . and generally surrounds the exterior of the con-\n tainer. The frame is formed of a plurality of vertical bars\n that extend so as to form a cage-like configuration around\n the walls[.]\u201d \u2019785 col. 10 ll. 15\u201319. As shown in Figures 1\n and 2 of the \u2019785 patent, the \u201cvertical bars,\u201d i.e., \u201cstructural\n support members,\u201d of the disclosed frame are depicted as\n separate and distinct components vis-\u00e0-vis the walls, even\n extending beyond the walls to the bottom of the container.\n Id., Figs. 1 and 2. Indeed, each embodiment disclosed in\n the \u2019785 patent includes this configuration. Thus, as with\n independent claims 1 and 16, the broader specification sup-\n ports the District Court\u2019s construction.\n     Finally, during prosecution of the \u2019785 patent, SandBox\n disclaimed the construction it now proposes, and limited\n the \u201cstructural support members\u201d to a separate and\n\fCase: 19-1684    Document: 53      Page: 15    Filed: 05/18/2020\n\n\n\n\n SANDBOX LOGISTICS LLC   v.

Specifically, in response to an obvious-\n ness rejection over prior art, including U.S. Publication\n No. 2013/0206415 (\u201cSheesley\u201d), SandBox distinguished\n Sheesley by arguing that the \u201ccontainer . . . [of Sheesley] is\n formed from corrugated metal\u201d in which \u201cthe corrugated\n metal structure is an integral part of the sidewalls used to\n form the structure of the container . . . . As such, the side-\n walls do not include separate, distinct support members as\n recited by [the] independent [c]laims[.]\u201d J.A. 1268\u201369; see\n J.A. 1269 (\u201cAs shown in F[ig]. 9, the sidewalls are stand-\n alone components of the container . . . without any addi-\n tional support members attached thereto.\u201d). This is incon-\n sistent with SandBox\u2019s position on appeal, viz., that the\n same claim language \u201cbroadly encompasses fortifications\n made in the walls themselves, such as internal folds or cor-\n rugations that add strength.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 3. SandBox\n clearly disavowed this subject matter, and cannot be al-\n lowed to recapture it. See Omega Eng\u2019g, Inc, v. Raytek\n Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (\u201cThe doctrine\n of prosecution disclaimer . . . preclud[es] patentees from re-\n capturing through claim interpretation specific meanings\n disclaimed during prosecution.\u201d); see also Aylus Networks,\n Inc. v. Apple Inc., 856 F.3d 1353, 1360 (Fed.

OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge TARANTO.\n Opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part filed by\n                 Circuit Judge NEWMAN.\n TARANTO, Circuit Judge.\n     Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions AB owns U.S. Pa-\n tent No. 7,043,040, which describes and claims a bone-an-\n chored hearing aid that transmits soundwaves\n transcranially from a patient\u2019s deaf side to the patient\u2019s\n non-deaf ear. Oticon Medical AB, Oticon Medical LLC, and\n William Demant Holding A/S (together, Oticon) success-\n fully sought from the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)\n two inter partes reviews of, collectively, all claims of the\n \u2019040 patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 311\u2013319. In those reviews,\n the PTO\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board concluded that\n Oticon proved claims 4\u20136 and 11\u201312 unpatentable, but did\n not prove claims 7\u201310 unpatentable. (Cochlear disclaimed\n claims 1\u20133 and 13.) Cochlear appeals the ruling on claims\n 4\u20136 and 11\u201312, while Oticon cross-appeals the ruling on\n claims 7\u201310. We affirm the Board\u2019s conclusions as to all\n claims except claim 10, as to which we vacate and remand.\n                               I\n                              A\n     The \u2019040 patent describes a hearing aid with several\n parts. One part is a vibration-producing component im-\n planted and mechanically anchored into a patient\u2019s skull\n on the patient\u2019s deaf side. \u2019040 patent, col. 2, lines 16\u201322,\n 48\u201355. An external part of the hearing aid, which includes\n a microphone, picks up sound on the patient\u2019s deaf side,\n processes the sound, and generates vibrations in the im-\n planted part. Id., col. 2, line 44, through col. 3, line 8.\n Those vibrations are transmitted through the patient\u2019s\n skull to the patient\u2019s non-deaf ear, so that the patient\u2019s\n non-deaf ear perceives sound originating from the deaf-ear\n side. Id.\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 3    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED    v. OTICON MEDICAL AB              3\n\n\n\n     Several additional details discussed in the specification\n are relevant to the issues before us. The \u2019040 patent notes\n that high-frequency soundwaves, as they traverse the\n skull, weaken in strength more than do low-frequency\n soundwaves; that is, transcranial attenuation is greater for\n treble than for bass frequencies. Id., col. 2, lines 56\u201362.\n The patent suggests that this differential attenuation may\n be addressed by selectively amplifying treble frequencies\n relative to bass frequencies. Id. In addition, the patent\n describes the following alternative embodiments of the\n hearing aid: one with a battery in the external part that\n powers the internal part through induction, another with a\n battery in the internal part that is recharged through in-\n duction. Id., col. 3, lines 11\u201324.\n      Claim 1 of the \u2019040 patent is the independent claim on\n which all claims now at issue depend, directly or indirectly.\n It recites:\n     1. A bone-conducting bone-anchored hearing aid\n         apparatus for sound transmission from one\n         side of a patient\u2019s head to the patient\u2019s cochlea\n         on another side of the patient\u2019s head for reha-\n         bilitation of unilateral hearing loss, the hear-\n         ing aid apparatus comprising:\n         a vibratory generating part arranged to\n            generate vibrations that are mechani-\n            cally transmitted through the skull\n            bone from a deaf side to the inner ear\n            on the other side of the patient; and\n         an implantable part operative to mechani-\n             cally anchor the vibratory generating\n             part, the implantable part being osse-\n             ointegrated in the patient\u2019s skull bone\n             behind an external ear at the deaf side\n             of a patient.\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53      Page: 4    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4            COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED      v. OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n Id., col. 3, lines 29\u201341. Cochlear statutorily disclaimed in-\n dependent claims 1 and 13 and dependent claims 2\u20133 dur-\n ing the inter partes reviews. The claims addressed by the\n Board and now before us are dependent claims 4\u201312, all of\n which are apparatus claims.\n      Claims 4 and 5 require that the frequency characteris-\n tics of the hearing aid are \u201cspecifically adapted to transmit\n vibrations in the skull bone from one side of the skull to the\n other side\u201d (by incorporation of claim 3) and require that\n treble frequencies are amplified more than bass frequen-\n cies. Id., col. 3, lines 44\u201353. Claim 6, dependent on claim\n 1, requires electronic circuitry \u201cto convert a signal from a\n microphone of the hearing aid to the vibratory generating\n part from an analog signal to a digital signal.\u201d Id., col. 4,\n lines 1\u20135. Claims 7\u20139, dependent on claim 6, all require\n certain \u201cdigital signal processing means\u201d or \u201csignal pro-\n cessing means.\u201d Id., col. 4, lines 7\u201319. Claim 10, depend-\n ent on claim 6, requires \u201cdirectivity means comprising at\n least one directivity dependent microphone and/or signal\n processing means.\u201d Id., col. 4, lines 20\u201324. Claim 11, de-\n pendent on claim 1, specifies that the implanted part and\n the vibration-producing part are included in the internal\n part and that power is transmitted from the external part\n of the hearing aid to the internal part by induction. Id., col.\n 4, lines 26\u201332. Claim 12, dependent on claim 11, adds that\n the internal part includes a rechargeable battery to be\n charged by induction from an external power supply. Id.,\n col. 4, lines 33\u201336.\n                               B\n      Oticon filed two petitions for inter partes reviews, chal-\n lenging all claims of the \u2019040 patent. The Board, acting as\n delegee of the PTO\u2019s Director, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 42.4, 42.108, in-\n itially instituted a review only of claims 1\u20136 and 11\u201313. It\n declined to institute a review of claims 7\u201310 on the ground\n that those claims likely are means-plus-function claims\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53      Page: 5    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v.

Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348 (2018), the Board\n added claims 7\u201310 to the proceedings. It authorized the\n filing of supplemental briefs on those claims. In the sup-\n plemental briefing, the parties agreed to broad construc-\n tions for the means-plus-function limitations, namely that\n the \u201cdigital signal processing means\u201d and \u201csignal pro-\n cessing means\u201d limitations include a \u201cdigital signal proces-\n sor\u201d and the \u201cdirectivity means\u201d limitation includes \u201ca\n directivity dependent microphone (or directional micro-\n phone) and/or a digital signal processor.\u201d J.A. 461\u201363, 476.\n     The Board proceeded to trial on the following invalidity\n grounds: claims 4\u20135 as obvious over Vaneecloo 2 and Carls-\n son; 3 claims 6, 7, and 9 as obvious over Vaneecloo, Carls-\n son, and Leysieffer; 4 claim 8 as obvious over Vaneecloo,\n\n\n\n     1    Because of the filing date of the application that is-\n sued as the \u2019040 patent, the means-plus-function provision\n applicable in this case is 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6, which is now\n codified, without change material to this case, as 35 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 112(f).

The study involved surgically im-\n planting a bone-anchored hearing device on a patient\u2019s deaf\n side that transcranially transmits sound received on the\n deaf side to the patient\u2019s non-deaf ear. J.A. 784. The in-\n vestigators concluded that \u201cthe amplification of the high-\n pitched sounds captured on the anakusis side and per-\n ceived by transcranial route by the contralateral ear al-\n lowed for a significant rise in sound perception thresholds\n of frequencies between 1,000 and 4,000 Hz.\u201d J.A. 788.\n     Carlsson discloses the use of a bone-anchored hearing\n device for the treatment of patients with conductive or sen-\n sorineural hearing loss.

The Board also\n concluded that Oticon had not proven claims 7\u201310 un-\n patentable, reasoning that the means-plus-function limita-\n tions of those claims have no corresponding structure\n disclosed in the specification, so that the Board could not\n \u201cascertain the differences between the claimed invention\n and the asserted prior art\u201d for those claims. J.A. 16\u201330, 89.\n      The Board decided several claim-construction disputes\n relevant to the issues now before us, relying on the broad-\n est-reasonable-interpretation standard, whose applicabil-\n ity to this case is not in dispute. It ruled that claim 1\u2019s\n preamble phrase \u201cfor rehabilitation of unilateral hearing\n loss,\u201d applicable to all claims currently at issue, did not\n limit the scope of the claims. J.A. 33\u201335.

We\n reject this challenge at the first step, agreeing with the\n Board that the phrase is not limiting for the apparatus\n claims at issue.\n      \u201cWe have treated the effect of preamble language as a\n claim-construction issue.\u201d Arctic Cat Inc. v. GEP Power\n Prods., Inc., 919 F.3d 1320, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2019). We have\n stated that \u201cas a general rule preamble language is not\n treated as limiting,\u201d Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. Marchon Eye-\n wear, Inc., 672 F.3d 1335, 1347 (Fed.

Bush Hog, LLC, 703 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir.\n 2012) (quotation marks omitted). We have also explained\n that \u201c[t]hose general formulations have for decades been\n implemented through a number of more concrete and ob-\n jective rules.\u201d Arctic Cat, 919 F.3d at 1327.\n      \u201cIn general, a preamble limits the invention if it recites\n essential structure or steps, or if it is necessary to give life,\n meaning, and vitality to the claim.\u201d Catalina Mktg. Int\u2019l,\n Inc. v. Coolsavings.com, Inc., 289 F.3d 801, 808 (Fed. Cir.\n 2002) (quotation marks omitted).

But \u201cpreamble language merely extolling benefits\n or features of the claimed invention does not limit the claim\n scope without clear reliance on those benefits or features\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53     Page: 10    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10             COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED   v. OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n as patentably significant.\u201d Catalina, 289 F.3d at 809. Fur-\n ther, \u201c[w]e have long ruled that a preamble is not limiting\n where a patentee defines a structurally complete invention\n in the claim body and uses the preamble only to state a\n purpose or intended use for the invention.\u201d Arctic Cat, 919\n F.3d at 1328 (quotation marks omitted); see Georgetown\n Rail Equip. Co. v. Holland L.P., 867 F.3d 1229, 1236 (Fed.\n Cir. 2017); Catalina, 289 F.3d at 808; Rowe v. Dror, 112\n F.3d 473, 478 (Fed. Cir. 1997).\n      The Board in this case correctly held that the preamble\n phrase \u201cfor rehabilitation of unilateral hearing loss\u201d is not\n a limitation on the scope of these apparatus claims. J.A.\n 31\u201335. The preamble\u2019s recitation of \u201cfor rehabilitation of\n unilateral hearing loss\u201d is merely a statement of intended\n use of the claimed hearing aid. It identifies no structure\n for the apparatus claimed. Moreover, this use itself is not\n an inventive or patentably distinct aspect of the claimed\n invention, as \u201crehabilitation of unilateral hearing loss\u201d was\n a conventional use of prior art bone-anchored hearing aids.\n See \u2019040 patent, col. 1, lines 44\u201361; Arctic Cat, 919 F.3d at\n 1329\u201330 (preamble phrase \u201c[a] personal recreational vehi-\n cle\u201d was not limiting because it merely described conven-\n tional, rather than inventive aspects of the claimed\n invention).\n      The bodies of the claims contain the only descriptions\n of the structure for the hearing aid, with no additional\n structure furnished by the preamble phrase at issue. For\n example, the body of independent claim 1 identifies the ori-\n entation and implantation of the device relative to the pa-\n tient\u2019s head. See \u2019040 patent, col. 3, lines 36\u201337 (\u201cfrom a\n deaf side to the inner ear on the other side of the patient\u201d);\n id., col. 3, lines 39\u201341 (\u201cthe implantable part being osseoin-\n tegrated in the patient\u2019s skull bone behind an external ear\n at the deaf side of a patient\u201d). The body of the claim also\n recites the function and position of the implanted \u201cvibra-\n tory generating part.\u201d See id., col. 3, lines 34\u201339 (\u201cgenerate\n vibrations that are mechanically transmitted through the\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 11    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v. OTICON MEDICAL AB            11\n\n\n\n skull\u201d and \u201can implantable part operative to mechanically\n anchor the vibratory generating part\u201d). These descriptions\n offer a complete structure such that \u201cfor rehabilitation of\n unilateral hearing loss\u201d adds nothing to the configuration\n of the claimed device.\n     The phrase \u201cfor rehabilitation of unilateral hearing\n loss\u201d also is not necessary to provide antecedent basis for\n the body of the claims. Although the preamble term \u201ca pa-\n tient\u201d may provide antecedent basis for claim 1\u2019s later rec-\n itation of \u201cthe patient,\u201d that is not the preamble language\n Cochlear argues is limiting. A conclusion that some pre-\n amble language is limiting does not imply that other pre-\n amble language, or the entire preamble, is limiting. See\n TomTom, 790 F.3d at 1322\u201323. The language at issue\n here, which states only an intended use, adds no structural\n element, and provides no antecedent basis for the body of\n the claims, is not limiting.\n                               B\n      Claims 4 and 5, which depend directly or indirectly on\n disclaimed claim 3, require that \u201cthe frequency character-\n istics of the [bone-anchored hearing aid] are specifically\n adapted to transmit vibrations in the skull bone from one\n side of the skull to the other side.\u201d Claim 4 further requires\n that the hearing aid amplifies treble frequencies more than\n bass frequencies. Claim 5 additionally requires that the\n amplified \u201ctreble frequencies have a frequency greater\n than 1 kHz.\u201d\n      Cochlear challenges the Board\u2019s obviousness determi-\n nations for claims 4 and 5 on three grounds. The first ar-\n gument\u2014that Carlsson teaches away from use in patients\n with profound hearing loss\u2014is premised on an incorrect as-\n sumption that the intended-use language of the preamble\n is limiting, an assumption we have rejected above. The sec-\n ond argument\u2014that the \u201cspecifically adapted to\u201d limita-\n tion requires that the frequency characteristics \u201caccount\n for the mechanics of the skull\u201d\u2014and third argument\u2014that\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53     Page: 12    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12             COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED   v. OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n the Board lacked substantial evidence to find that\n Vaneecloo teaches amplifying treble frequencies more than\n bass frequencies\u2014are not persuasive for the reasons we\n now discuss.\n     Cochlear has not persuasively identified an error in the\n Board\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cspecifically adapted to\u201d limita-\n tion has its ordinary meaning, with no additional require-\n ment that adaptions be made to frequency characteristics\n to \u201caccount for the mechanics of the skull.\u201d J.A. 39\u201341. In\n fact, Cochlear has not concretely identified why the Board\u2019s\n ordinary-meaning construction is not the broadest reason-\n able interpretation.\n      To the extent that Cochlear is suggesting that the lan-\n guage requires a particular intent or objective of a hearing-\n aid designer or manufacturer, we reject the suggestion. We\n have previously held that the claim term \u201cadapted to\u201d gen-\n erally means \u201cmade to,\u201d \u201cdesigned to,\u201d or \u201cconfigured to\u201d\n perform the stated function, and we have not introduced a\n subjective element into the construction of the phrase. See\n In re Man Machine Interface Techs. LLC, 822 F.3d 1282,\n 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2016); In re Giannelli, 739 F.3d 1375, 1379\n (Fed. Cir. 2014); Aspex Eyewear, 672 F.3d at 1349. To the\n extent that Cochlear is suggesting an objective character-\n istic of the configuration, it has not shown overbreadth of\n the Board\u2019s ordinary-meaning construction. The claim\n phrase at issue, in its broadest reasonable interpretation,\n covers any frequency-characteristic adaption \u201cto transmit\n vibrations in the skull bone from one side of the skull to the\n other side.\u201d Either Cochlear\u2019s proposal is redundant of that\n language or it is unduly limiting. In neither case is there\n error in the Board\u2019s claim construction.\n     Cochlear\u2019s final challenge to the Board\u2019s conclusion\n about claims 4 and 5 addresses the additional differential-\n amplification limitations of those claims. This challenge\n turns specifically on whether there is substantial evidence\n in the record from which the Board could have determined\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 13    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v. OTICON MEDICAL AB            13\n\n\n\n that Vaneecloo discloses amplifying treble frequencies\n more than bass frequencies. We conclude that the Board\n did have such evidence.\n       The Board relied on Vaneecloo\u2019s disclosure that \u201cthe\n amplification of the high-pitched sounds captured on the\n anakusis side and perceived by transcranial route by the\n contralateral ear allowed for a significant rise in sound per-\n ception thresholds of frequencies between 1,000 Hz and\n 4,000 Hz.\u201d J.A. 59 (citing J.A. 788). Based on that state-\n ment, the Board found that Vaneecloo discloses amplifying\n treble frequencies more than bass frequencies. See J.A.\n 59\u201362. Vaneecloo\u2019s disclosure explicitly states that the\n study involved amplification of treble frequencies. J.A.\n 788. Vaneecloo also notes that \u201chigh-pitched sounds reach\n the ear opposite the source with an attenuation that in-\n creases proportionately with the frequency of the sound,\u201d\n indicating that high-pitched sounds must be amplified\n more than low-pitched sounds. J.A. 783; see J.A. 59. Other\n record evidence further supports the notion that Vaneecloo\n discloses amplifying treble frequencies more than bass fre-\n quencies. The BAHA Classic 300 device available at the\n time of the Vaneecloo study 9 was capable of adjusting tre-\n ble and bass frequencies relative to each other. J.A. 1414\n (\u201cThe low frequency response can be adjusted using the\n tone control . . . . Turn the tone control [counterclockwise]\n to decrease the low frequency sound.\u201d); J.A. 1443 (\u201c[T]he\n low-frequency response can be adjusted in order to increase\n . . . the treble sound relative to the bass.\u201d). The Board,\n therefore, had substantial evidence to conclude that\n Vaneecloo discloses amplifying treble frequencies more\n than bass frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n     9  Cochlear agrees that the BAHA Classic 300 was\n the bone-anchored hearing aid in existence at the time of\n the Vaneecloo study. J.A. 58; J.A. 385.\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53     Page: 14    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14             COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED   v. OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n                               C\n     Claim 6 requires electronic circuitry that converts an\n analog signal to a digital signal, which the Board construed\n as requiring \u201can analog-to-digital converter.\u201d Cochlear\n does not dispute that the combination of Vaneecloo, Carls-\n son, and Leysieffer discloses all limitations of claim 6. But\n Cochlear challenges the Board\u2019s finding that a relevant ar-\n tisan would have been motivated to combine the signal pro-\n cessor disclosed in Leysieffer with the hearing aid disclosed\n by the combination of Vaneecloo and Carlsson.\n     We reject that challenge, concluding that the Board\u2019s\n finding is supported by substantial evidence. Oticon\u2019s ex-\n pert, Dr. Popelka, asserted that a relevant artisan would\n have been motivated to modify the Vaneecloo/Carlsson de-\n vice to include an analog-to-digital converter in order to ob-\n tain the advantages associated with digital processing (e.g.,\n real-time and multi-channel audio signal processing; feed-\n back reduction; more closely matching the needs of the in-\n dividual patient). J.A. 737\u201338. Leysieffer itself discusses\n the benefits of digital signal processing in bone-anchored\n hearing aids, including adapting for patient-specific cir-\n cumstances and updating processing software without re-\n moving the implanted part of the hearing aid. J.A. 921,\n 931. In light of that evidence, and the absence of persua-\n sive contrary evidence that the Board had to credit, the\n Board reasonably found a motivation to combine Leysieffer\n with Vaneecloo and Carlsson. 10\n\n\n\n\n      10 Cochlear additionally argues that the Board did\n not analyze the motivation to combine references in light\n of the claim preamble. As discussed above, however, the\n preamble is not limiting.\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 15     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v.

The\n Board found that Hough\u2019s disclosure of an external electro-\n magnetic coil that generates an alternating current,\n thereby causing the implanted magnet to vibrate, meets\n the induction limitation. J.A. 78\u201381 (citing J.A. 1097\u201398);\n see also J.A. 1098 (\u201cWhen the current is passed through the\n external coil . . . alternating electromagnetic fields cause\n the magnet implanted in the temporal bone to vibrate.\u201d).\n Cochlear challenges the Board\u2019s finding that Hough antic-\n ipates claim 11, arguing that because there is no voltage or\n current generated in the internal part of Hough, it is not\n powered by induction. We reject this challenge.\n      Cochlear does not challenge the Board\u2019s construction of\n \u201cinduction\u201d to mean, without further qualification, \u201celectro-\n magnetic induction.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 29. Although Coch-\n lear earlier disputed the Board\u2019s construction of \u201cpower\u201d\u2014\n which the Board declined to limit to electric power\u2014Coch-\n lear\u2019s argument on appeal focuses only on the construction\n of \u201cinduction.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 29\u201330; J.A. 41\u201345. Cochlear\n does not challenge the Board\u2019s understanding of Hough.\n Instead, Cochlear argues that \u201celectromagnetic induction\u201d\n necessarily requires the generation of voltage or current in\n the internal part, a limitation that the Board specifically\n excluded from its construction of \u201cinduction.\u201d J.A. 44\u201345.\n     We are not persuaded. Cochlear has not established a\n plain meaning of \u201celectromagnetic induction\u201d (or \u201cpower\u201d)\n as requiring a voltage or current on the receiving end. Nor\n does the \u2019040 patent specification require a particular\n structure or the generation of voltage or current in the in-\n ternal part. See, e.g., \u2019040 patent, col. 3, lines 11\u201314. Par-\n ticularly for the vibrator, the \u2019040 patent describes the\n element in only general terms. Id., col. 3, lines 9\u201311; see\n also id., col. 2, lines 50\u201353; id., Fig. 2. We therefore affirm\n the Board\u2019s finding that Hough anticipates claim 11.\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53      Page: 16   Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16             COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED   v. OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n                              E\n     Claim 12, which depends on claim 11, further requires\n the external part of the hearing aid to charge, by induction,\n a rechargeable battery in the internal part. Cochlear does\n not dispute that the combination of Hough and Leysieffer\n teaches every limitation of claim 12. Cochlear argues only\n that the Board did not have substantial evidence to find a\n motivation to combine Hough with Leysieffer because the\n internal part in Hough\u2014a magnet\u2014is not powered by a\n battery.\n      We disagree. The Board had substantial evidence to\n find that moving the battery to an internal part of the hear-\n ing aid would allow for a smaller and more aesthetically\n pleasing external part, a benefit that would have motivated\n a relevant artisan to combine the two references. J.A. 82\u2013\n 85. The prior art specifically notes a patient preference for\n hearing aids with smaller, more discrete external parts,\n which can be achieved by moving external elements of the\n device to the internal part. J.A. 83 (citing J.A. 918\u201319,\n 1343); see also J.A. 918\u201319 (visible external parts \u201cstigma-\n tize the wearer and therefore are not willingly worn,\u201d and\n for these devices, \u201cit now seems to be a good idea to design\n the systems such that they can be completely implanted\u201d).\n Moving the battery to an internal part reduces the size of\n the external part even if the internal part itself does not\n require power, as is the case for Hough.\n     Cochlear lastly argues that Hough teaches away from\n using its disclosed device in patients with profound hearing\n loss. See J.A. 1099. Because the preamble is not limiting,\n and there is therefore no limitation on the type of hearing\n loss to be treated by the claimed hearing aid, this argument\n is not persuasive.\n                              III\n     On cross-appeal, Oticon argues that the Board erred in\n determining that it could not conduct a prior-art analysis\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 17    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v. OTICON MEDICAL AB            17\n\n\n\n for claims 7\u201310 and, on that sole basis, ruling that those\n claims had not been proved unpatentable. The Board con-\n cluded that because these claims contain means-plus-func-\n tion limitations, without a corresponding structure\n disclosed in the specification, it could not construe the\n claims in order to compare the claim requirements with the\n prior art. We hold that the Board did not err as to claims\n 7\u20139, but did err as to claim 10.\n                               A\n     Where a claim contains a requirement that must be\n met by any device or process within its scope, and the\n meaning of that requirement is entirely unknown, the\n claim cannot be compared to the prior art for purposes of\n an invalidity analysis, and so that analysis cannot be con-\n ducted. See Samsung Elecs. America, Inc. v. Prisua Eng\u2019g\n Corp., 948 F.3d 1342, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2020). One such sit-\n uation can occur when a multi-element claim recites as one\n required element a means for performing a function but\n does not recite a structure for performing that function. If\n the claim is in that format, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6, states that\n the claim scope is defined based on what the specification\n sets out as corresponding structures for performing the\n claimed function. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 (claim element de-\n fined to mean those structures and equivalents). If the\n specification fails to recite a corresponding structure, then\n there is a wholly undefined claim element: the claim has\n what amounts to an inkblot as a required element of the\n claim. Such a claim logically cannot be compared to prior\n art, because an essential claim element has no discernible\n meaning.\n     Such a claim is indefinite, Williamson v. Citrix Online,\n LLC, 792 F.3d 1339, 1351\u201352 (Fed. Cir. 2015), but that is\n not the inquiry in an inter partes review, in which the\n Board may not hold a challenged claim of a patent indefi-\n nite. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 311(b); Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC v.\n Lee, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 2141\u201343 (2016); Samsung, 948 F.3d\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53    Page: 18    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18             COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED   v. OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n at 1350\u201353. The crucial point for purposes of an inter\n partes review of issued claims is that, in the situation just\n described, it is impossible to conduct a prior-art analysis\n because there is a required claim element without mean-\n ing. In this situation, the Board should \u201cconclude that it\n could not reach a decision on the merits with respect to\n whether petitioner had established the unpatentability of\n those claims under sections 102 or 103.\u201d Samsung, 948\n F.3d at 1353.\n     The Board here properly did just that for claims 7\u20139.\n Each of those claims plainly contains at least one required\n means-plus-function claim element for which the specifica-\n tion provides no corresponding structure. In this circum-\n stance, the Board\u2019s necessary course of action was to\n conclude that unpatentability of claims 7\u20139 could not be\n shown. We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s ruling as to claims\n 7\u20139.\n     Such a necessary rejection of the petitioner\u2019s prior-art\n challenge rests on a deficiency of the patentee\u2019s making,\n not the petitioner\u2019s. We have accordingly held, and here\n reiterate, that \u201cin cases in which the Board cannot reach a\n final decision as to the patentability of certain claims be-\n cause it cannot ascertain the scope of those claims with rea-\n sonable certainty, the petitioner would not be estopped by\n 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(e) from challenging those claims under sec-\n tions 102 or 103 in other proceedings.\u201d Samsung, 948 F.3d\n at 1353 n.3.\n                              B\n      Claim 10 is different in a crucial respect. It does not\n contain a required claim element in means-plus-function\n form. Claim 10 recites a \u201cdirectivity means comprising at\n least one directivity dependent microphone and/or signal\n processing means in the electronic circuitry.\u201d \u2019040 patent,\n col. 4, lines 20\u201324 (emphasis added). The use of the dis-\n junctive creates three alternative subsets of claim cover-\n age\u2014a directivity dependent microphone only; signal\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53     Page: 19    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED    v. OTICON MEDICAL AB            19\n\n\n\n processing means only; and a directivity dependent micro-\n phone together with signal processing means. The first al-\n ternative is independent of the others, and it has a\n discernible meaning and can be compared to prior art.\n      The Board correctly held that claim 10 invokes means-\n plus-function claiming in part, i.e., insofar as it claims a\n \u201csignal processing means.\u201d The Board also correctly held\n that the specification does not recite a corresponding struc-\n ture for performing the signal processing function. J.A. 25\u2013\n 27. Oticon does not challenge these holdings. But claim\n 10, unlike the other means-plus-function claims, also de-\n scribes a stand-alone alternative to the signal processing\n means: a directivity dependent microphone, which is a\n clear structure for performing the claimed directivity\n means. The Board did not conclude that this alternative\n (which recites structure in the claim) is even subject to 35\n U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6, let alone that it flunks the requirement\n of that provision. Rather, it relied entirely on the presence\n of the signal-processing-means alternatives in the claim to\n deem a prior-art analysis impossible. J.A. 26\u201329. That was\n error.\n     For present purposes, we may assume that claim 10 is\n indefinite because it includes what is tantamount to an\n inkblot as an alternative way of coming within its bounda-\n ries. But Samsung establishes that indefiniteness of a\n claim does not always imply inability to conduct a prior-art\n analysis needed for an inter partes review. See Samsung,\n 948 F.3d at 1352\u201353, 1355 (remanding for the Board to pro-\n ceed despite one kind of indefiniteness, based on mixing\n product and process elements in a claim). The questions\n are different. Here, even if claim 10 is indefinite, such a\n conclusion would not imply that it is incapable of being\n compared to prior art to determine if one of its alternatives\n is anticipated or would have been obvious on the grounds\n asserted.\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53      Page: 20    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 20             COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED    v. OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n      We vacate the Board\u2019s ruling as to claim 10 and re-\n mand. The Board should consider on remand whether the\n directivity-dependent-microphone alternative is outside\n the scope of \u00a7 112, \u00b66, because it recites a structure (the\n directivity dependent microphone) that sufficiently corre-\n sponds to the claimed directivity means. Sage Prods., Inc.\n v. Devon Indus., Inc., 126 F.3d 1420, 1427\u201328 (Fed. Cir.\n 1997) (even if a claim uses the term \u201cmeans,\u201d \u201cwhere a\n claim recites a function, but then goes on to elaborate suf-\n ficient structure, material, or acts within the claim itself to\n perform entirely the recited function, the claim is not in\n means-plus-function format\u201d); see also Williamson, 792\n F.3d at 1349; cf. Media Rights Techs., Inc. v. Capital One\n Fin. Corp., 800 F.3d 1366, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The Board\n also should consider whether any asserted prior-art chal-\n lenges render the directivity-dependent-microphone alter-\n native within claim 10 unpatentable, if considered on its\n own, and whether, if so, claim 10 as a whole is unpatenta-\n ble on that ground. See In re Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC,\n 793 F.3d 1268, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2015); see also In re Klein,\n 987 F.2d 1569, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1993).\n     We emphasize that we go no farther in vacating and\n remanding with respect to claim 10 than to hold that a\n prior-art analysis is not made impossible, in the context of\n the \u201cand/or\u201d claim at issue, by the impossibility of such an\n analysis as to other alternatives in such a disjunctive for-\n mulation.\n                               IV\n     We affirm the Board\u2019s decision that claims 4\u20136 and 11\u2013\n 12 are unpatentable and that claims 7\u20139 have not been\n proven unpatentable.

OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n deafness, or \u201cunilateral hearing loss.\u201d Cochlear Bone An-\n chored Solutions AB (\u201cCochlear\u201d) explains that single-side\n deafness is usually due to damage to one ear such that the\n ear cannot perceive sound, and is not remediable by simply\n increasing amplification to that ear. The experts agreed\n that there was an unmet need for effective remedy. How-\n ever, my colleagues find the system in the \u2019040 patent to be\n obvious, although the system escaped the many persons\n studying the problem and seeking solution, as seen in the\n prior art.\n      In finding the \u2019040 patent\u2019s system obvious, the court\n employs an improper analytic technique. The court first\n removes major limitations from the claims, and then ap-\n plies selected pieces of prior art to the residue. This is\n achieved by holding that the opening clause of all the\n claims is \u201cnot limiting,\u201d whereby the claims are freed of\n critical limitations and are then held to embrace prior art\n that is excluded from the \u2019040 system by the introductory\n statement. My colleagues dispose of these limitations by\n designating the introductory clause as a mere \u201cpreamble\u201d\n that does not limit the claims\u2014although the clause states\n limitations fundamental to the \u2019040 invention. It is incor-\n rect to remove such claim limitations when they describe\n substantive aspects of the invention, and the error is com-\n pounded when, as here, the court then broadens the resi-\n due of the claim into obviousness over prior art that is\n disavowed by the preamble.\n     The claim is viewed as a whole\n     Claims 4\u20136, 11, and 12 all depend from claim 1, and\n start with the following clause:\n     1. A bone-conducting bone-anchored hearing aid\n     apparatus for sound transmission from one side of\n     a patient\u2019s head to the patient\u2019s cochlea on another\n     side of the patient\u2019s head for rehabilitation of uni-\n     lateral hearing loss, . . . .\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 24    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v. OTICON MEDICAL AB             3\n\n\n\n The court rules that this entire clause is \u201cnot limiting,\u201d and\n thereby opens the claims to prior art that is distinct from\n the \u2019040 invention, prior art that is distinguished by the\n limitations in this clause. As stated in In re Bulloch, 604\n F.2d 1362, 1365 (CCPA 1979), the \u201cintroductory claim lan-\n guage . . . is more than a mere statement of purpose; and\n that language is essential to particularly point out the in-\n vention defined by the claims.\u201d\n     This introductory claim language provides the \u201cunder-\n standing of what the inventors actually invented and in-\n tended to encompass by the claim.\u201d Corning Glass Works\n v. Sumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed.\n Cir. 1989). The proper analytic method is to determine ob-\n viousness of the invention as a whole and the claims as a\n whole in light of the prior art as a whole. See In re Gorman,\n 933 F.2d 982, 986 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (\u201c[T]he test is whether\n the teachings of the prior art, taken as a whole, would have\n made obvious the claimed invention.\u201d). It is a distortion to\n hold that the obviousness determination does not include\n consideration of the introductory words of the claim.\n      Claims cannot enlarge what is described in the specifi-\n cation, but neither can the claims be redacted to provide a\n broader focus for prior art. Determination of obviousness\n (and anticipation) is of the invention that is claimed, with\n claims that are viewed in light of the specification. See\n United States v. Adams, 383 U.S. 39, 48\u201349 (1966) (\u201cWhile\n the claims of a patent limit the invention, and specifica-\n tions cannot be utilized to expand the patent monopoly, it\n is fundamental that claims are to be construed in the light\n of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to\n ascertaining the invention.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).\n     The court\u2019s analysis produces major changes in the re-\n lation of the claimed invention to the prior art; as illus-\n trated in the majority opinion at page 14 n.10, where the\n court disposes of the obviousness analysis by stating that\n there is no need to \u201canalyze the motivation to combine\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53     Page: 25     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4              COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED    v.

Corning Glass, 868 F.2d at\n 1257; see \u2019040 patent, col. 1, ll. 5\u201311. The court\u2019s exclusion\n of the \u201cpreamble\u201d from the description of the claimed in-\n vention underlies the court\u2019s entire analysis, and leads to\n the court\u2019s erroneous ruling of invalidity.\n     The invention described and claimed in the\n     \u2019040 patent is not obvious from the prior art\n     The Board recognized that the \u2019040 patent\u2019s hearing de-\n vice is not simply a combination of known elements, and\n stated: \u201cwe do not disagree with Patent Owner\u2019s contention\n that the proposed modification would require \u2018substantially\n modifying the device.\u2019\u201d Board Op. at 85.

That interpretation must be consistent with the\n specification and the prosecution history, and must be the\n reasonable interpretation that would be reached by a per-\n son of skill in the field of the invention.\n     For example, there is dispute about the meaning of \u201cin-\n duction\u201d in claims 11 and 12. Oticon argues that \u201cinduc-\n tion\u201d should be broadly construed to encompass Hough\u2019s\n magnet, although the experts agreed that induction re-\n quires generation of current or voltage in the receiver. The\n Board, and now this court, hold that claim 11 is anticipated\n by the Hough device, although the Board recognized that\n \u201cHough does not include an internal receiving conductor.\u201d\n Board Op. at 84. The Board held that Hough anticipates\n claim 11 even though the experts for both sides agreed that\n Hough\u2019s magnet does not serve as a conductor. The court\n errs in holding that Hough\u2019s different system \u201canticipates\u201d\n the \u2019040 patent claims. See MEHL/Biophile Int\u2019l Corp. v.\n Milgraum, 192 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\u201canticipa-\n tion\u201d requires that the invention is described in a single\n reference disclosing every limitation of the claims).\n     The question of obviousness includes determining\n whether the prior art suggests producing the claimed com-\n bination and with a reasonable expectation of success.\n Here, no prior art suggests the combination that is de-\n scribed and claimed in the \u2019040 patent. It appears undis-\n puted that at the time of this invention, transcranial\n attenuation was not even considered in bone-anchored\n hearing devices. Reply Br. 21\u201322 (citing J.A. 464\u201365 (\u201c[A]t\n the critical date, [hearing devices] were primarily used to\n treat conductive hearing loss (CHL), where sound\n\fCase: 19-1105     Document: 53    Page: 27    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6              COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED   v.

When treating CHL, sound vibrations\n are not being transmitted to the opposite side of the head\n (and thus do not need to travel very far within the skull),\n and therefore TA is not a concern.\u201d); J.A. 2352\u201353, \u00b6 21\n (\u201c[S]ince sound waves are not needed to travel across the\n skull to the cochlea on the other side of the head (in the\n treatment of conductive hearing loss), transcranial attenu-\n ation is not an important consideration.\u201d).\n     In sum, the analysis by the Board, and now by my col-\n leagues, is contrary to the laws of obviousness and antici-\n pation. There is no suggestion in the prior art of this new\n and useful device. See Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil,\n 774 F.2d 1132, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (\u201c[T]here must be\n some reason for the combination other than the hindsight\n gleaned from the invention itself.\u201d). Nonetheless, the court\n here uses the \u2019040 patent\u2019s teachings to select various as-\n pects from the prior art, and then combines these selections\n with the template of the \u2019040 patent, having removed the\n limitations of the claims\u2019 introductory clause. From this\n flawed analysis, and its flawed conclusion, I respectfully\n dissent.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">Case: 19-1105   Document: 53     Page: 1   Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n   United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Federal Circuit\n                 ______________________\n\n  COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED SOLUTIONS AB,\n                 Appellant\n\n                            v.\n\n   OTICON MEDICAL AB, OTICON MEDICAL LLC,\n        WILLIAM DEMANT HOLDING A/S,\n                Cross-Appellants\n             ______________________\n\n                  2019-1105, 2019-1106\n                 ______________________\n\n     Appeals from the United States Patent and Trademark\n Office, Patent Trial and Appeal Board in Nos.

To the\n extent that Cochlear is suggesting an objective character-\n istic of the configuration, it has not shown overbreadth of\n the Board\u2019s ordinary-meaning construction. The claim\n phrase at issue, in its broadest reasonable interpretation,\n covers any frequency-characteristic adaption \u201cto transmit\n vibrations in the skull bone from one side of the skull to the\n other side.\u201d Either Cochlear\u2019s proposal is redundant of that\n language or it is unduly limiting. In neither case is there\n error in the Board\u2019s claim construction.\n     Cochlear\u2019s final challenge to the Board\u2019s conclusion\n about claims 4 and 5 addresses the additional differential-\n amplification limitations of those claims. This challenge\n turns specifically on whether there is substantial evidence\n in the record from which the Board could have determined\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 13    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v. OTICON MEDICAL AB            13\n\n\n\n that Vaneecloo discloses amplifying treble frequencies\n more than bass frequencies. We conclude that the Board\n did have such evidence.\n       The Board relied on Vaneecloo\u2019s disclosure that \u201cthe\n amplification of the high-pitched sounds captured on the\n anakusis side and perceived by transcranial route by the\n contralateral ear allowed for a significant rise in sound per-\n ception thresholds of frequencies between 1,000 Hz and\n 4,000 Hz.\u201d J.A. 59 (citing J.A. 788). Based on that state-\n ment, the Board found that Vaneecloo discloses amplifying\n treble frequencies more than bass frequencies. See J.A.\n 59\u201362. Vaneecloo\u2019s disclosure explicitly states that the\n study involved amplification of treble frequencies. J.A.\n 788. Vaneecloo also notes that \u201chigh-pitched sounds reach\n the ear opposite the source with an attenuation that in-\n creases proportionately with the frequency of the sound,\u201d\n indicating that high-pitched sounds must be amplified\n more than low-pitched sounds. J.A. 783; see J.A. 59. Other\n record evidence further supports the notion that Vaneecloo\n discloses amplifying treble frequencies more than bass fre-\n quencies. The BAHA Classic 300 device available at the\n time of the Vaneecloo study 9 was capable of adjusting tre-\n ble and bass frequencies relative to each other. J.A. 1414\n (\u201cThe low frequency response can be adjusted using the\n tone control . . . . Turn the tone control [counterclockwise]\n to decrease the low frequency sound.\u201d); J.A. 1443 (\u201c[T]he\n low-frequency response can be adjusted in order to increase\n . . . the treble sound relative to the bass.\u201d). The Board,\n therefore, had substantial evidence to conclude that\n Vaneecloo discloses amplifying treble frequencies more\n than bass frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n     9  Cochlear agrees that the BAHA Classic 300 was\n the bone-anchored hearing aid in existence at the time of\n the Vaneecloo study.

OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n                               C\n     Claim 6 requires electronic circuitry that converts an\n analog signal to a digital signal, which the Board construed\n as requiring \u201can analog-to-digital converter.\u201d Cochlear\n does not dispute that the combination of Vaneecloo, Carls-\n son, and Leysieffer discloses all limitations of claim 6. But\n Cochlear challenges the Board\u2019s finding that a relevant ar-\n tisan would have been motivated to combine the signal pro-\n cessor disclosed in Leysieffer with the hearing aid disclosed\n by the combination of Vaneecloo and Carlsson.\n     We reject that challenge, concluding that the Board\u2019s\n finding is supported by substantial evidence. Oticon\u2019s ex-\n pert, Dr. Popelka, asserted that a relevant artisan would\n have been motivated to modify the Vaneecloo/Carlsson de-\n vice to include an analog-to-digital converter in order to ob-\n tain the advantages associated with digital processing (e.g.,\n real-time and multi-channel audio signal processing; feed-\n back reduction; more closely matching the needs of the in-\n dividual patient). J.A. 737\u201338. Leysieffer itself discusses\n the benefits of digital signal processing in bone-anchored\n hearing aids, including adapting for patient-specific cir-\n cumstances and updating processing software without re-\n moving the implanted part of the hearing aid. J.A. 921,\n 931. In light of that evidence, and the absence of persua-\n sive contrary evidence that the Board had to credit, the\n Board reasonably found a motivation to combine Leysieffer\n with Vaneecloo and Carlsson. 10\n\n\n\n\n      10 Cochlear additionally argues that the Board did\n not analyze the motivation to combine references in light\n of the claim preamble. As discussed above, however, the\n preamble is not limiting.\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 15     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v.

The\n Board found that Hough\u2019s disclosure of an external electro-\n magnetic coil that generates an alternating current,\n thereby causing the implanted magnet to vibrate, meets\n the induction limitation. J.A. 78\u201381 (citing J.A. 1097\u201398);\n see also J.A. 1098 (\u201cWhen the current is passed through the\n external coil . . . alternating electromagnetic fields cause\n the magnet implanted in the temporal bone to vibrate.\u201d).\n Cochlear challenges the Board\u2019s finding that Hough antic-\n ipates claim 11, arguing that because there is no voltage or\n current generated in the internal part of Hough, it is not\n powered by induction. We reject this challenge.\n      Cochlear does not challenge the Board\u2019s construction of\n \u201cinduction\u201d to mean, without further qualification, \u201celectro-\n magnetic induction.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 29.

Cochlear\n does not challenge the Board\u2019s understanding of Hough.\n Instead, Cochlear argues that \u201celectromagnetic induction\u201d\n necessarily requires the generation of voltage or current in\n the internal part, a limitation that the Board specifically\n excluded from its construction of \u201cinduction.\u201d J.A. 44\u201345.\n     We are not persuaded. Cochlear has not established a\n plain meaning of \u201celectromagnetic induction\u201d (or \u201cpower\u201d)\n as requiring a voltage or current on the receiving end.

OTICON MEDICAL AB\n\n\n\n                              E\n     Claim 12, which depends on claim 11, further requires\n the external part of the hearing aid to charge, by induction,\n a rechargeable battery in the internal part. Cochlear does\n not dispute that the combination of Hough and Leysieffer\n teaches every limitation of claim 12. Cochlear argues only\n that the Board did not have substantial evidence to find a\n motivation to combine Hough with Leysieffer because the\n internal part in Hough\u2014a magnet\u2014is not powered by a\n battery.\n      We disagree. The Board had substantial evidence to\n find that moving the battery to an internal part of the hear-\n ing aid would allow for a smaller and more aesthetically\n pleasing external part, a benefit that would have motivated\n a relevant artisan to combine the two references. J.A. 82\u2013\n 85. The prior art specifically notes a patient preference for\n hearing aids with smaller, more discrete external parts,\n which can be achieved by moving external elements of the\n device to the internal part. J.A. 83 (citing J.A. 918\u201319,\n 1343); see also J.A. 918\u201319 (visible external parts \u201cstigma-\n tize the wearer and therefore are not willingly worn,\u201d and\n for these devices, \u201cit now seems to be a good idea to design\n the systems such that they can be completely implanted\u201d).\n Moving the battery to an internal part reduces the size of\n the external part even if the internal part itself does not\n require power, as is the case for Hough.\n     Cochlear lastly argues that Hough teaches away from\n using its disclosed device in patients with profound hearing\n loss. See J.A. 1099. Because the preamble is not limiting,\n and there is therefore no limitation on the type of hearing\n loss to be treated by the claimed hearing aid, this argument\n is not persuasive.\n                              III\n     On cross-appeal, Oticon argues that the Board erred in\n determining that it could not conduct a prior-art analysis\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 17    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v.

The first al-\n ternative is independent of the others, and it has a\n discernible meaning and can be compared to prior art.\n      The Board correctly held that claim 10 invokes means-\n plus-function claiming in part, i.e., insofar as it claims a\n \u201csignal processing means.\u201d The Board also correctly held\n that the specification does not recite a corresponding struc-\n ture for performing the signal processing function. J.A. 25\u2013\n 27. Oticon does not challenge these holdings. But claim\n 10, unlike the other means-plus-function claims, also de-\n scribes a stand-alone alternative to the signal processing\n means: a directivity dependent microphone, which is a\n clear structure for performing the claimed directivity\n means. The Board did not conclude that this alternative\n (which recites structure in the claim) is even subject to 35\n U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6, let alone that it flunks the requirement\n of that provision. Rather, it relied entirely on the presence\n of the signal-processing-means alternatives in the claim to\n deem a prior-art analysis impossible. J.A. 26\u201329. That was\n error.\n     For present purposes, we may assume that claim 10 is\n indefinite because it includes what is tantamount to an\n inkblot as an alternative way of coming within its bounda-\n ries.

The experts agreed\n that there was an unmet need for effective remedy. How-\n ever, my colleagues find the system in the \u2019040 patent to be\n obvious, although the system escaped the many persons\n studying the problem and seeking solution, as seen in the\n prior art.\n      In finding the \u2019040 patent\u2019s system obvious, the court\n employs an improper analytic technique. The court first\n removes major limitations from the claims, and then ap-\n plies selected pieces of prior art to the residue. This is\n achieved by holding that the opening clause of all the\n claims is \u201cnot limiting,\u201d whereby the claims are freed of\n critical limitations and are then held to embrace prior art\n that is excluded from the \u2019040 system by the introductory\n statement. My colleagues dispose of these limitations by\n designating the introductory clause as a mere \u201cpreamble\u201d\n that does not limit the claims\u2014although the clause states\n limitations fundamental to the \u2019040 invention. It is incor-\n rect to remove such claim limitations when they describe\n substantive aspects of the invention, and the error is com-\n pounded when, as here, the court then broadens the resi-\n due of the claim into obviousness over prior art that is\n disavowed by the preamble.\n     The claim is viewed as a whole\n     Claims 4\u20136, 11, and 12 all depend from claim 1, and\n start with the following clause:\n     1. A bone-conducting bone-anchored hearing aid\n     apparatus for sound transmission from one side of\n     a patient\u2019s head to the patient\u2019s cochlea on another\n     side of the patient\u2019s head for rehabilitation of uni-\n     lateral hearing loss, . . . .\n\fCase: 19-1105    Document: 53      Page: 24    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n COCHLEAR BONE ANCHORED     v.

See Ex Parte Publicover et al., No. 2018\u2013005362,\n 2019 WL 1453980 (P.T.A.B. Mar. 8, 2019). For the reasons\n explained below, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision.\n                        BACKGROUND\n                   I. The \u2019273 Application\n     The \u2019273 Application relates generally to methods of\n tracking eye movements in a graphical user interface envi-\n ronment such as wearable virtual- or augmented-reality\n display devices, using those movements to determine the\n user\u2019s intent, and performing an action based on that in-\n tent. \u2019273 Application \u00b6\u00b6 17\u201321. The eye-tracking technol-\n ogy thereby enables the user to interact with and control\n the device with his or her eye movements, rather than us-\n ing traditional tools such as a computer mouse, joystick, or\n touch-sensitive displays. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4\u20136. According to Pub-\n licover, the purported invention seeks to solve certain\n unique challenges associated with discerning user intent\n based on eye movements. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4 (citing \u2019273\n Application \u00b6 6).\n     One such challenge, and stated goal of the purported\n invention, is to accurately discern user intent by distin-\n guishing the user\u2019s involuntary movements from voluntary\n movements intended to interact with, and control, the de-\n vice. \u2019273 Application \u00b6\u00b6 6, 87. Two types of \u201c[v]oluntary\n movements that may [be used to] convey purposeful intent\u201d\n are saccadic eye movements and voluntary head move-\n ments that produce vestibulo-ocular eye movements. Id.\n \u00b6\u00b6 89, 115.\n\fCase: 19-1883     Document: 46     Page: 3    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: PUBLICOVER                                           3\n\n\n\n     The appealed claims rely on identifying vestibulo-ocu-\n lar eye movements to discern user intent. 1 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 89, 98,\n 179. Vestibulo-ocular eye movements are \u201cgenerally ac-\n cepted\u201d as one of \u201cfour fundamental types of eye move-\n ments.\u201d Id. \u00b6 115. In order for a person\u2019s eyes to remain\n focused on a particular target while his or her head is mov-\n ing, vestibulo-ocular eye movements \u201ccompensate for head\n movements by\u201d rapidly and reflexively \u201cmoving the eye[s]\n through the same angle as a head rotation, but in the op-\n posite direction.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 116, 222. The eye and head move-\n ments \u201ccorrespond\u201d \u201capproximate[ly] . . . in movement\n magnitudes.\u201d Id. \u00b6 224, Fig. 4. \u201cThis has the effect of\u201d\n keeping the eyes on a fixation point and \u201cstabilizing an im-\n age of the external world.\u201d Id. \u00b6 116. Although the head\n movements that produce the vestibulo-ocular movement\n are generally voluntary, \u201cthe vestibulo-ocular [eye] move-\n ment itself is involuntary.\u201d Id. \u00b6 182.\n     Vestibulo-ocular movements can occur in conjunction\n with another fundamental type of eye movement, saccadic\n eye movements. \u201cSaccadic eye movements are rapid move-\n ments that abruptly change the fixation point of the\n eye[s].\u201d Id. \u00b6 119; see also id. \u00b6\u00b6 217\u201318. After a person\n performs a saccadic eye movement, he or she may naturally\n rotate the head to align it with the new fixation point of the\n eyes. As the specification explains, \u201cany shift in gaze\n greater than about 20\u00b0 . . . is usually associated with a head\n movement.\u201d Id. \u00b6 179. If the eyes were to remain still as\n the head moves, the head would carry the eyes off target.\n The involuntary vestibulo-ocular reflex of the eyes keeps\n the eyes on target by moving the eyes in the opposite direc-\n tion of the head rotation. Id. \u00b6 116.\n\n\n\n\n     1    The Board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of all\n pending claims, claims 31\u201339, 41\u201356, and 58\u201361, but Pub-\n licover\u2019s appeal is limited to claims 43\u201351.\n\fCase: 19-1883    Document: 46     Page: 4    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                          IN RE: PUBLICOVER\n\n\n\n\n                   II. Procedural History\n     The examiner rejected claims 43 and 46\u201351 of the \u2019273\n Application as obvious over the combination of U.S.\n 2014/0380230 A1 (Venable) and U.S. 2012/0081666 A1 (Ki-\n derman). J.A. 1147\u201350. Additionally, the examiner re-\n jected claims 44\u201345 as obvious over the combination of\n Venable, Kiderman, and U.S. 6,932,090 (Reschke).\n J.A. 1161\u201363. Publicover appealed to the Board, which af-\n firmed the examiner\u2019s rejections.\n     On appeal before us, Publicover directs its argument\n solely to independent claim 43, from which claims 44\u201351\n depend. Claim 43 recites a method for using a graphical\n user interface to determine a user\u2019s intent by detecting\n when there has been a vestibulo-ocular eye movement as-\n sociated with a head movement, and then performing an\n action related to a viewed object or its location:\n     43.

Randall Mfg. v. Rea, 733 F.3d 1355, 1362\n (Fed. Cir. 2013). The factual findings include, inter alia,\n \u201cthe scope and content of the prior art\u201d and \u201cdifferences be-\n tween the prior art and the claims at issue.\u201d Id. (cit-\n ing KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406 (2007)).\n     This court reviews the Board\u2019s legal determinations de\n novo, and the Board\u2019s factual findings underlying those de-\n terminations for substantial evidence. Belden Inc. v. Berk-\n Tek LLC, 805 F.3d 1064, 1073 (Fed. Cir. 2015). A finding\n is supported by substantial evidence if a reasonable mind\n might accept the evidence to support the finding. Consol.\n Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).\n     Publicover argues that the Board erred in finding that\n the prior art teaches the claim limitation of \u201cidentifying . . .\n a vestibulo-ocular movement.\u201d Publicover contends that\n neither Kiderman alone nor the combination of Venable\n and Kiderman teach this limitation.

Ve-\n nable is directed to \u201can eye tracking system . . . configured\n to produce a periodically updated position signal based\n upon a determined location of a user\u2019s gaze on a . . . user\n interface\u201d element. Venable \u00b6 19. Venable discloses that\n some embodiments rely on identifying saccadic eye move-\n ments to determine the user\u2019s intent to select the user in-\n terface element.      Id. \u00b6 26.    Once Venable\u2019s system\n \u201cdetermin[es] that the user has selected the U[ser ]I[nter-\n face] element,\u201d it will perform an action such as, for exam-\n ple, \u201claunching a program represented by the element.\u201d Id.\n \u00b6 37.\n      As shown in Venable\u2019s figures, the eye tracking system\n is integrated with \u201ca head-mounted display . . . configured\n to display augmented reality images.\u201d Id. \u00b6 15; see also id.\n Figs. 1A\u2013C, 4A\u2013C, 5A\u2013D, 6. Venable states that its system\n may comprise not only an eye tracking system but also\n \u201cmay include . . . motion sensors . . . and/or . . . image sen-\n sors\u201d that may be \u201cincorporated into [the] head-mounted\n display.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 19\u201320. Venable contemplates using sev-\n eral different types of components alone or together, in-\n cluding \u201ca head tracker, eye tracker, accelerometer, and/or\n gyroscope for motion detection and/or intent recognition.\u201d\n Id. \u00b6 51. Based on Venable\u2019s disclosure of the \u201chead\n tracker, eye tracker, accelerometer, and/or gyroscope for\n motion detection and/or intent recognition,\u201d the Board and\n examiner reasonably found that Venable teaches concur-\n rently tracking eye movements and head movements, and\n is not limited \u201cto head-fixed saccades\u201d for discerning user\n intent. J.A. 1501; Publicover, 2019 WL 1453980, at *8. We\n disagree with Publicover\u2019s arguments to the contrary.\n     Kiderman is directed to a head mounted goggle based\n video oculography system for recording and evaluating sac-\n cadic eye movements \u201cfor assisting in the diagnosis of\u201d\n\fCase: 19-1883     Document: 46      Page: 7    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: PUBLICOVER                                            7\n\n\n\n certain brain injuries and disorders \u201cthat cause highly sac-\n cadic results.\u201d Kiderman \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5, 18. Importantly, with\n regard to vestibulo-ocular movements, Kiderman discloses\n that they occur in conjunction with saccadic eye move-\n ments. Id. \u00b6 12. In the background of the invention, Ki-\n derman explains that \u201c[d]uring . . . saccades\u201d with \u201cshift[s]\n in gaze larger than about 20\u00b0,\u201d \u201cfirst the eye produces a\n saccade to get gaze on target, whereas the head follows\n more slowly and the vestibulo-ocular reflex causes the eyes\n to roll back in the head to keep gaze on the target.\u201d Id.\n Kiderman further explains that \u201c[t]he vestibular system\n stabilizes vision with head movement . . . , sensing the di-\n rection and speed of head acceleration and moving the eyes\n accordingly.\u201d Id. \u00b6 7.\n     The examiner reasoned that the basis to combine Ki-\n derman\u2019s disclosure of vestibulo-ocular movement with Ve-\n nable\u2019s system for tracking saccadic eye movements to\n \u201cidentify[]. . . a vestibulo-ocular movement\u201d was to \u201cim-\n prove[] on the accuracy of\u201d Venable\u2019s system \u201cby consider-\n ing the effect of head movement on the saccade.\u201d\n J.A. 1501\u201302; see also J.A. 1141. This is particularly so\n given Kiderman\u2019s teaching that vestibulo-ocular eye move-\n ments are commonly associated with and naturally follow\n from saccadic eye movements and Venable\u2019s disclosure of\n embodiments that already track both eye and head move-\n ments. Kiderman \u00b6 12; Venable \u00b6 51.\n     Before the Board, Publicover argued that Kiderman\n taken individually does not teach the \u201cidentifying . . . a ves-\n tibulo-ocular movement\u201d limitation.           J.A. 1477\u201378;\n J.A. 1588. The Board rejected that argument, noting that\n \u201cKiderman only is relied upon to teach that vestibulo-ocu-\n lar movement, such as that recited in claim 43, is one\n known type of head movement.\u201d Publicover, 2019 WL\n 1453980, at *9 (citing Kiderman \u00b6 12). The Board found\n that \u201cthe eye tracking system of Venable may be combined\n with . . . Kiderman[\u2019s]\u201d disclosure of vestibulo-ocular move-\n ment. Id. Like the examiner, whose Answer the Board\n\fCase: 19-1883    Document: 46      Page: 8    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                           IN RE: PUBLICOVER\n\n\n\n\n adopted as its own, the Board found that the accuracy of\n Venable\u2019s system which tracks both eye and head move-\n ments would be improved by identifying vestibulo-ocular\n movements in addition to saccadic eye movements. Pub-\n licover, 2019 WL 1453980, at *3, *9. Substantial evidence\n supports this finding, despite Publicover\u2019s arguments to\n the contrary.\n      Before this court, Publicover presents additional argu-\n ments that were not previously presented to the Board.\n For example, Publicover contends that neither reference,\n taken individually or together, disclose \u201cidentifying\u201d that\n \u201cthe head velocity and eye velocity occur[] concurrently\u201d\n during \u201ca vestibulo-ocular movement,\u201d as the claims re-\n quire. \u2019273 Application at claim 43 (emphasis added); Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 5\u20136. Because Publicover did not raise\n these arguments to the Board, we conclude that they are\n waived. See In re Watts, 354 F.3d 1362, 1368 (Fed. Cir.\n 2004) (\u201cdeclin[ing] to consider the appellant\u2019s new argu-\n ment regarding the scope of [the prior art] raised for the\n first time on appeal\u201d). Moreover, contrary to Publicover\u2019s\n argument, Kiderman teaches that the head velocity and\n eye velocity occur concurrently during vestibulo-ocular\n movement, as the claims require. Kiderman discloses that\n when the head moves, \u201cthe vestibulo-ocular reflex causes\n the eyes to\u201d move \u201cto keep the gaze on the target.\u201d Kider-\n man \u00b6 12; see also id. \u00b6 7 (\u201cThe vestibular system stabilizes\n vision with head movement,\u201d as opposed to allowing vision\n to \u201cshift\u201d \u201cduring head movement,\u201d by \u201csensing the direc-\n tion and speed of head acceleration and moving the eyes\n accordingly.\u201d). In order \u201cto keep the gaze on the target,\u201d as\n Kiderman discloses, the head and eyes must be moving\n concurrently in opposite directions with roughly the same\n movement magnitudes. 2\n\n\n\n     2   Kiderman \u201cincorporated . . . by reference\u201d certain\n related patent application publications \u201cin their entirety\u201d:\n\fCase: 19-1883     Document: 46       Page: 9     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: PUBLICOVER                                               9\n\n\n\n     We also note the examiner\u2019s finding, which was\n adopted by the Board, that Publicover\u2019s written description\n with respect to the \u201cidentifying . . . a vestibulo-ocular move-\n ment\u201d limitation is rather thin in detail as to how the ap-\n plicant\u2019s system identifies vestibulo-ocular movement. J.A.\n 1501; Publicover, 2019 WL 1453980, at *3, *8. The exam-\n iner explained that the limitation \u201cis merely supported\u201d by\n \u201cparagraph [224]\u201d of Publicover\u2019s specification, which pro-\n vides the \u201cwell-known\u201d definition of vestibulo-ocular move-\n ment.      J.A. 1501.     Paragraph 224 of Publicover\u2019s\n specification states:\n     If the right and left eye move in the same direction\n     . . . and this direction is opposite the direction of the\n     head . . . with an approximate correspondence in\n     movement magnitudes, then the eye movement is\n     classified as vestibulo-ocular . . . .\n \u2019273 Application \u00b6 224; see also id. \u00b6 116 (providing a simi-\n lar description of how vestibulo-ocular movement occurs).\n     Publicover argues that Venable and Kiderman\u2019s disclo-\n sures are too sparse to adequately explain to a skilled arti-\n san how to modify Venable\u2019s system to identify vestibulo-\n ocular movement. But as the examiner and Board correctly\n found, Publicover\u2019s specification is just as sparse on how a\n system would identify this type of eye movement. Under\n the circumstances, we find this attorney argument as to the\n capabilities of a skilled artisan unpersuasive. See Uber\n Techn., Inc. v. X One, Inc., No. 19-1164, 2020 WL 2123399,\n at *5 (Fed. Cir.

AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.      3\n\n\n\n in two inter partes review proceedings, IPR2017-01495 and\n IPR2017-01538, 1 challenging claims 24\u201327 of U.S. Patent\n No. 7,928,348 (\u201cthe \u2019348 patent\u201d). Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd.,\n Toyota Motor Corporation, and American Honda Motor\n Co., Inc. (collectively, \u201cAisin\u201d) were the petitioners in\n IPR2017-01538, whereas Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd. and Toyota\n Motor Corporation initiated IPR2017-01495. The Board\n found the challenged claims unpatentable as obvious over\n several combinations of prior art references. For the rea-\n sons stated below, we affirm.\n                       I. BACKGROUND\n     Resolution of this appeal does not require a detailed\n recitation of the various prior art references and grounds\n of unpatentability addressed in the Board\u2019s decisions. Ac-\n cordingly, only the facts relevant to this appeal are dis-\n cussed below.\n                     A. The \u2019348 Patent\n     The \u2019348 patent, titled \u201cElectromagnetic Device with\n Integrated Fluid Flow Path,\u201d issued on April 19, 2011. It\n discloses fluid-cooled electromagnetic devices that contain\n parts that are substantially encapsulated in a monolithic\n body of a phase change polymer and include heat-exchange\n mechanisms. In particular, the patent relates to motors,\n generators, and transformers cooled by a fluid coolant. By\n preventing cooling liquids from contacting portions of the\n device directly, corrosion of, or damage to, parts of the de-\n vice is avoided. \u2019348 patent, col. 2 ll. 6\u201337. The disclosed\n devices include a magnetically inducible core, at least one\n electrical conductor, a monolithic body, a fluid pathway at\n least partially embedded in the monolithic body, and inlets\n\n\n\n\n     1    This proceeding was consolidated with IPR2018-\n 00443.\n\fCase: 19-1718      Document: 77    Page: 4     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4        INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v. AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.\n\n\n\n and outlets in the fluid pathway. Id., col. 25 ll. 5\u201314. Claim\n 24, the only independent claim at issue, recites:\n     24. A fluid conveying mechanism comprising:\n         a) an electromagnetic field-functioning de-\n         vice having a magnetically inducible core\n         and at least one electrical conductor that\n         creates a magnetic field in the core when\n         electrical current is conducted through the\n         conductor;\n         b) a monolithic body of injection molded\n         thermoplastic material substantially en-\n         capsulating the at least one conductor; and\n         c) a fluid pathway at least partially embed-\n         ded in and integral with the monolithic\n         body, with a least one of a fluid inlet into\n         the pathway and a fluid outlet from the\n         pathway being formed in the body of injec-\n         tion molded thermoplastic, and the path-\n         way through the body being confined\n         within the body.\n \u2019348 patent, col. 25 l. 3\u2013col. 26 l. 3. Dependent claim 27\n recites:\n     27.

The\n polymer then cools and solidifies into a shape that has con-\n formed to the shape of the mold. Id., col. 12 ll. 58\u201364;\n col. 16 ll. 27\u201346. Additionally, the patent teaches that the\n monolithic body is made from thermoplastic.

Kon-\n ishi also discloses additional synthetic or thermoplastic\n resins that can be used to seal the stator core, such as pol-\n yphenylene sulfide and syndiotactic polystyrene.\n J.A. 3195, \u00b6\u00b6 29\u201333.\n                  C. The Board\u2019s Decisions\n     On December 12, 2018, the Board issued its final writ-\n ten decisions. In IPR2017-01538, the Board found that Ai-\n sin had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that\n claims 24\u201327 of the \u2019348 are unpatentable as obvious over\n Konishi. Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd. v. Intellectual Ventures II\n LLC, No. IPR2017-01538, 2018 WL 6584583, at *14\n (P.T.A.B. Dec. 12, 2018).\n      The Board construed the term \u201cmonolithic body\u201d as \u201ca\n body formed as a single piece.\u201d Id. at *4. The Board con-\n cluded that this does not exclude a body formed by \u201cunitiz-\n ing multiple pieces.\u201d Id. The Board construed the term \u201ca\n fluid pathway at least partially embedded in and integral\n with the monolithic body\u201d as \u201ca fluid pathway at least par-\n tially (i) fixed within and formed by the material of the\n monolithic body or (ii) formed by a conduit fixed within and\n integrally surrounded by the material of the monolithic\n body.\u201d Id. As to the term \u201cplumbing fitting,\u201d the Board\n found that it \u201crefer[s] to a connector that couples conduits\n together in a fluid-tight manner.\u201d Id. at *6.\n     As relevant to this appeal, the Board found that Kon-\n ishi discloses, or renders obvious, the independent claim 24\n limitation \u201ca monolithic body of injection molded thermo-\n plastic material substantially encapsulating the at least\n one conductor.\u201d Id. at *9\u201312. According to the Board, Kon-\n ishi discloses that stator molded portion 5 and stator can\n 51 are formed as a single unit, and accordingly, \u201cthe stator\n molded portion 5/stator can 51 is a monolithic body that\n entirely surrounds windings 33, as permitted by [its] con-\n struction of the phrase.\u201d Id. at *10. The Board also found\n\fCase: 19-1718     Document: 77     Page: 7      Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v. AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.      7\n\n\n\n that Konishi teaches the use of injection-molded thermo-\n plastic to make the monolithic body. Id. at *11\u201312. Accord-\n ing to the Board, Konishi expressly teaches a molded stator\n made from polydicyclopentadiene, and expressly states\n that thermoplastic is suitable for sealing the stator core.\n Id. The Board rejected Intellectual Ventures\u2019 argument\n that a person of skill in the art (\u201cPOSA\u201d) would not use\n thermoplastic in Konishi\u2019s motor due to the risk of melting\n in the vicinity of the windings 33. Id. at *13. In doing so,\n the Board noted that Konishi itself discloses the possibility\n of utilizing thermoplastics and would not have made such\n a disclosure if it did not account for the heat generated by\n windings 33. Id. As a result, the Board found that Konishi\n teaches this limitation.\n      As to the dependent claims, Intellectual Ventures did\n not dispute that Konishi teaches the additional limitations\n of dependent claims 25 and 26. Id. With respect to claim\n 27, the Board found the limitation \u201csaid at least one of a\n fluid inlet and a fluid outlet is in the form of a plumbing\n fitting\u201d obvious in light of Konishi. Id. According to the\n Board, Konishi explains that working fluid is drawn into\n and flows out of flow paths 52, and fluid is confined in these\n paths \u201cin a fluid-tight manner to achieve its heat removal\n function.\u201d Id. at *14. Accordingly, the Board found that\n Aisin had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that\n claims 24\u201327 would have been obvious over the teachings\n of Konishi. Id.\n      Intellectual Ventures filed requests for rehearing pur-\n suant to 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.71(d), which the Board denied on\n February 4, 2019. J.A. 715\u201324; J.A. 2951\u201360. This appeal\n followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1295(a)(4) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141.\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n     The scope of our review in an appeal from the Board is\n limited. We review the Board\u2019s factual findings for sub-\n stantial evidence and the Board\u2019s legal conclusions de novo.\n\fCase: 19-1718    Document: 77      Page: 8    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8       INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v. AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.\n\n\n\n Microsoft Corp. v. Proxyconn, Inc., 789 F.3d 1292, 1297\n (Fed. Cir. 2015). \u201cSubstantial evidence . . . means such rel-\n evant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as ade-\n quate to support a conclusion.\u201d Consol. Edison Co. v.\n NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938). Obviousness is a question\n of law based on underlying facts. Apple Inc. v. Samsung\n Elecs. Co., 839 F.3d 1034, 1047 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (en banc).\n What the prior art teaches, whether a person of ordinary\n skill in the art would have been motivated to combine ref-\n erences, and whether a reference teaches away from the\n claimed invention are all questions of fact. Id. at 1047\u201348;\n In re Mouttet, 686 F.3d 1322, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n     On appeal, Intellectual Ventures argues that the chal-\n lenged claims are not obvious over the various asserted\n grounds of unpatentability. As to obviousness in light of\n Konishi, Intellectual Ventures challenges the Board\u2019s con-\n clusion on just one theory: it argues that the Board\u2019s find-\n ings are not supported by substantial evidence because the\n claims require \u201cinjection molded thermoplastic,\u201d and it\n would not have been obvious or feasible to make Konishi\u2019s\n stator can from thermoplastic. Appellant\u2019s Br. 61.\n     As it did before the Board, Intellectual Ventures argues\n that a POSA would have been dissuaded from using ther-\n moplastic material to form Konishi\u2019s monolithic body be-\n cause of concerns regarding the high temperature\n environment of Konishi\u2019s stator can. Id. at 62\u201366. 2 Accord-\n ing to Intellectual Ventures, in the preferred embodiment\n of Konishi, the monolithic body is made up of specially en-\n gineered thermoset material polydicyclopentadiene\u2014dis-\n tinguishable from thermoplastic in that it can retain its\n mechanical strength upon reheating. Id. at 13, 61.\n\n\n     2    Intellectual Ventures does not dispute that using\n injection molded thermoplastic to form Konishi\u2019s mono-\n lithic body would result in a structure that meets all the\n claim limitations. Appellant\u2019s Br. 61\u201367.\n\fCase: 19-1718     Document: 77      Page: 9     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v. AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.      9\n\n\n\n Intellectual Ventures maintains that this distinction is im-\n portant because exposure to heat causes thermoplastic to\n soften or melt, and consequently lose its desired shape. Id.\n at 13\u201314. By contrast, thermoset materials can withstand\n high temperatures. Intellectual Ventures relies on por-\n tions of its expert declaration to argue that it would not\n have been obvious or even feasible to make the stator can\n of Konishi from thermoplastic. Appellant\u2019s Br. 62\u201365.\n     At bottom, Intellectual Ventures\u2019 arguments are an at-\n tempt to differentiate between the stator can 51 and the\n stator molded portion 5. Intellectual Ventures agrees that\n Konishi teaches (1) that thermoplastics may be used to\n form the stator molded portion 5; and (2) the stator molded\n portion 5 and stator can 51 may be formed as a single unit.\n Appellant\u2019s Br. 62; Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 1. But it insists\n that it does not follow that the stator can 51 may be made\n of thermoplastic.\n      The government responds that the Board considered\n this same argument, weighed the testimony of Intellectual\n Ventures\u2019 expert, and rejected it. Appellee\u2019s Br. 28. In the\n government\u2019s view, the Board\u2019s factual determinations re-\n garding what Konishi would teach a POSA are supported\n by substantial evidence. The government argues that In-\n tellectual Ventures \u201cturns a blind eye\u201d to Konishi\u2019s disclo-\n sure that it is possible to seal the stator core using a stator\n can formed of materials including \u201csynthetic resin,\u201d and\n such resins include thermoplastics. Id. at 29 (citing J.A.\n 3195, \u00b6 30). According to the government, this disclosure,\n combined with Konishi\u2019s teaching that \u201c[w]hen sealing as\n described above, the stator can . . . can also form a single\n unit with the stator mold,\u201d provides substantial evidence\n support for the Board\u2019s decision. Id. at 30 (citing J.A. 3195,\n \u00b6 38). We agree with the government.\n     The Board considered similar arguments regarding\n Konishi, and\u2014based on the disclosures of Konishi and the\n testimony of Aisin\u2019s expert\u2014found that it would have been\n\fCase: 19-1718     Document: 77     Page: 10     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10       INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v. AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.\n\n\n\n obvious to utilize injection molded thermoplastic to form\n Konishi\u2019s monolithic body (made up of the stator molded\n portion 5 and the stator can 51). Aisin Seiki, 2018 WL\n 6584583, at *11. Specifically, the Board found that Konishi\n discloses that the stator molded portion 5 and stator can 51\n are formed as a \u201csingle unit\u201d (thereby making up the mon-\n olithic body) and that injection molding is an exemplary\n method of sealing the stator core. Id. (citing J.A. 3194,\n \u00b6 16; J.A. 3195, \u00b6\u00b6 30\u201331, 37\u201338). Indeed, Konishi ex-\n pressly discloses that \u201cthermoplastic resins\u201d are types of\n synthetic resins that can be used to seal the stator core,\n and provides a list of various thermoplastic materials suit-\n able for such use. J.A. 3195, \u00b6\u00b6 30\u201331. Konishi also\n teaches that:\n      Examples of methods used in sealing the stator\n      core, etc., include RIM, resin transfer molding, re-\n      active molding, casting molding, injection molding,\n      and so on. Of these methods, reactive injection\n      molding is particularly preferable, since only little\n      force is required to close the mold, and the method\n      is suitable to molding large, complex shapes like\n      the stators of canned motor pumps.\n J.A. 3195, \u00b6 37. As the Board noted, Aisin\u2019s expert Dr.\n Trumper described Konishi\u2019s disclosures as follows:\n      [B]ecause thermoplastics were well known to have\n      properties well-suited for use in these environ-\n      ments, such as high heat conductivity allowing\n      heat to be easily transferred away from the motor,\n      a POSITA would have easily chosen a thermo-\n      plastic for use in sealing the stator core via injec-\n      tion molding. Alternatively, it would have been\n      obvious to a POSITA to mold the stator mold 5 and\n      stator can 51 as a single piece . . . in view of Kon-\n      ishi\u2019s description of integrally forming the stator\n      mold 5 with the stator can 51.\n J.A. 3110, \u00b6\u00b6 87\u201388 (citing J.A. 3194\u201395, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 28, 38).\n\fCase: 19-1718    Document: 77      Page: 11     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v. AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.    11\n\n\n\n     The Board also considered the testimony of Intellectual\n Ventures\u2019 expert Dr. Garris\u2014stating that a POSA would\n not use thermoplastic because of the expectation that the\n material would soften or melt because of heat from the\n windings 33\u2014and found that this testimony was incon-\n sistent with Konishi\u2019s express disclosures. Aisin Seiki,\n 2018 WL 6584583, at *11. Specifically, the Board found\n Dr. Garris\u2019s assertions unpersuasive in light of Konishi\u2019s\n teachings that (1) heat produced by windings/coils 33 is \u201cre-\n moved to the outside by the working fluid that passes\n through the inside of heat transfer pipes 1\u201d; and (2) heat\n produced by the stator core 3 and the stator coil 33 is re-\n moved to the outside by the working fluid that passes\n through the flow paths 52. Id. (citing J.A. 3194, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22).\n We defer to the Board\u2019s credibility determinations regard-\n ing expert testimony.\n     We also reject Intellectual Ventures\u2019 arguments that\n the Board\u2019s findings are not based on any expert testimony\n and should be rejected. First, the Board noted that it was\n \u201cpersuaded by Dr. Trumper\u2019s testimony that such materi-\n als were suitable, as taught by Konishi, and provided well-\n known benefits, e.g., high heat conductivity.\u201d Id. (citing\n J.A. 3110, \u00b6\u00b6 86\u201387). That Intellectual Ventures disagrees\n with the Board\u2019s reading of Dr. Trumper\u2019s testimony is of\n no moment. See Appellant\u2019s Br. 62 (\u201cThis statement [re-\n garding Konishi\u2019s teachings] by Petitioners\u2019 expert is a non\n sequitur at best.\u201d). Second, as the government correctly\n notes, in appropriate circumstances, the Board can make\n findings without expert testimony. See Appellee\u2019s Br.\n 33\u201334 (citing Belden Inc. v. Berk-Tek LLC, 805 F.3d 1064,\n 1079 (Fed. Cir. 2015)). Intellectual Ventures\u2019 attempts to\n distinguish Belden are unpersuasive. See Appellant\u2019s Re-\n ply Br. 2\u20133. Belden makes clear that, depending on the\n complexity of the art, Board members may be able to easily\n understand and \u201csoundly explain\u201d the prior art without\n help from experts. Belden, 805 F.3d at 1079 (Fed. Cir.\n 2015); see also VirnetX Inc. v. Apple Inc., 665 F. App\u2019x 880,\n\fCase: 19-1718   Document: 77     Page: 12      Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12      INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v. AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.\n\n\n\n 884 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (unpublished) (\u201c[T]o the extent that\n [Patent Owner] contends that the PTAB must consider ex-\n pert testimony, no authority supports that proposition.\u201d).\n Here, the Board considered expert testimony in addition to\n the disclosures of Konishi itself. It weighed this evidence\n and chose not to credit the testimony of Intellectual Ven-\n tures\u2019 expert. Given the art at issue, we do not view the\n Board\u2019s findings as \u201cread[ing] into Konishi that which is\n not there.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 3.\n     Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence\n supports the Board\u2019s findings that Konishi discloses the\n use of injection molded thermoplastic in its motor. The\n Board\u2019s conclusion that claims 24\u201327 of the \u2019348 patent are\n unpatentable as obvious is not erroneous.\n                      III.

As to obviousness in light of\n Konishi, Intellectual Ventures challenges the Board\u2019s con-\n clusion on just one theory: it argues that the Board\u2019s find-\n ings are not supported by substantial evidence because the\n claims require \u201cinjection molded thermoplastic,\u201d and it\n would not have been obvious or feasible to make Konishi\u2019s\n stator can from thermoplastic. Appellant\u2019s Br. 61.\n     As it did before the Board, Intellectual Ventures argues\n that a POSA would have been dissuaded from using ther-\n moplastic material to form Konishi\u2019s monolithic body be-\n cause of concerns regarding the high temperature\n environment of Konishi\u2019s stator can.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 62\u201366. </span><pre class=\"inline\">2 Accord-\n ing to Intellectual Ventures, in the preferred embodiment\n of Konishi, the monolithic body is made up of specially en-\n gineered thermoset material polydicyclopentadiene\u2014dis-\n tinguishable from thermoplastic in that it can retain its\n mechanical strength upon reheating.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 13, </span><pre class=\"inline\">61.\n\n\n     2    Intellectual Ventures does not dispute that using\n injection molded thermoplastic to form Konishi\u2019s mono-\n lithic body would result in a structure that meets all the\n claim limitations.

AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD.      9\n\n\n\n Intellectual Ventures maintains that this distinction is im-\n portant because exposure to heat causes thermoplastic to\n soften or melt, and consequently lose its desired shape.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n at 13\u201314. </span><pre class=\"inline\">By contrast, thermoset materials can withstand\n high temperatures. Intellectual Ventures relies on por-\n tions of its expert declaration to argue that it would not\n have been obvious or even feasible to make the stator can\n of Konishi from thermoplastic. Appellant\u2019s Br. 62\u201365.\n     At bottom, Intellectual Ventures\u2019 arguments are an at-\n tempt to differentiate between the stator can 51 and the\n stator molded portion 5. Intellectual Ventures agrees that\n Konishi teaches (1) that thermoplastics may be used to\n form the stator molded portion 5; and (2) the stator molded\n portion 5 and stator can 51 may be formed as a single unit.\n Appellant\u2019s Br. 62; Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 1. But it insists\n that it does not follow that the stator can 51 may be made\n of thermoplastic.\n      The government responds that the Board considered\n this same argument, weighed the testimony of Intellectual\n Ventures\u2019 expert, and rejected it. Appellee\u2019s Br. 28. In the\n government\u2019s view, the Board\u2019s factual determinations re-\n garding what Konishi would teach a POSA are supported\n by substantial evidence. The government argues that In-\n tellectual Ventures \u201cturns a blind eye\u201d to Konishi\u2019s disclo-\n sure that it is possible to seal the stator core using a stator\n can formed of materials including \u201csynthetic resin,\u201d and\n such resins include thermoplastics.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 29 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(citing J.A.\n 3195, \u00b6 30). According to the government, this disclosure,\n combined with Konishi\u2019s teaching that \u201c[w]hen sealing as\n described above, the stator can . . . can also form a single\n unit with the stator mold,\u201d provides substantial evidence\n support for the Board\u2019s decision.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 30 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(citing J.A. 3195,\n \u00b6 38). We agree with the government.\n     The Board considered similar arguments regarding\n Konishi, and\u2014based on the disclosures of Konishi and the\n testimony of Aisin\u2019s expert\u2014found that it would have been\n\fCase: 19-1718     Document: 77     Page: 10     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10       INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v.

Specifically, the Board found that Konishi\n discloses that the stator molded portion 5 and stator can 51\n are formed as a \u201csingle unit\u201d (thereby making up the mon-\n olithic body) and that injection molding is an exemplary\n method of sealing the stator core.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span></span> (citing J.A. </span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">3194,\n \u00b6 16; J.A. 3195, \u00b6\u00b6 30\u201331, 37\u201338). Indeed, Konishi ex-\n pressly discloses that \u201cthermoplastic resins\u201d are types of\n synthetic resins that can be used to seal the stator core,\n and provides a list of various thermoplastic materials suit-\n able for such use. J.A. 3195, \u00b6\u00b6 30\u201331. Konishi also\n teaches that:\n      Examples of methods used in sealing the stator\n      core, etc., include RIM, resin transfer molding, re-\n      active molding, casting molding, injection molding,\n      and so on. Of these methods, reactive injection\n      molding is particularly preferable, since only little\n      force is required to close the mold, and the method\n      is suitable to molding large, complex shapes like\n      the stators of canned motor pumps.\n J.A. 3195, \u00b6 37. As the Board noted, Aisin\u2019s expert Dr.\n Trumper described Konishi\u2019s disclosures as follows:\n      [B]ecause thermoplastics were well known to have\n      properties well-suited for use in these environ-\n      ments, such as high heat conductivity allowing\n      heat to be easily transferred away from the motor,\n      a POSITA would have easily chosen a thermo-\n      plastic for use in sealing the stator core via injec-\n      tion molding. Alternatively, it would have been\n      obvious to a POSITA to mold the stator mold 5 and\n      stator can 51 as a single piece . . . in view of Kon-\n      ishi\u2019s description of integrally forming the stator\n      mold 5 with the stator can 51.\n J.A. 3110, \u00b6\u00b6 87\u201388 (citing J.A. 3194\u201395, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 28, 38).\n\fCase: 19-1718    Document: 77      Page: 11     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n INTELLECTUAL VENTURES II LLC   v.

UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n     Before PROST, Chief Judge, O\u2019MALLEY and TARANTO,\n                      Circuit Judges.\n TARANTO, Circuit Judge.\n      Buddy and Donna Taylor allege that, after they pur-\n chased land near a United States Air Force base in New\n Mexico, the Air Force began flying training missions low\n over the land. Several years later, the Taylors entered into\n an agreement with Wind Energy Prototypes, LLC, giving\n the company an exclusive option to obtain an easement it\n could use to build and operate structures to collect energy\n from wind. The Taylors allege that during the term of the\n option, employees of the Air Force informally advised Wind\n Energy that the Federal Aviation Administration would\n not issue a No Hazard designation for such structures on\n the land. Thereafter, Wind Energy, rather than exercising\n the option, terminated the contract with the Taylors, a de-\n cision that the Taylors acknowledge was permitted by their\n contract with Wind Energy.\n     The Taylors sued the federal government in the Court\n of Federal Claims. The complaint is properly understood\n as making essentially two claims\u2014that the Air Force\u2019s in-\n formal advice to Wind Energy effected a regulatory taking\n of the Taylors\u2019 property interest in their contract with\n Wind Energy, and that the Air Force\u2019s flyovers effected a\n physical taking of their property interest in their land and\n associated air space. The trial court dismissed the com-\n plaint, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over the regu-\n latory-taking claim and, on the merits, that both taking\n claims failed to state a claim on which relief could be\n granted. We reverse the jurisdictional ruling but affirm\n the dismissal on the merits.\n                               I\n    The complaint alleges that in 1999 the Taylors pur-\n chased a large plot of land near a United States Air Force\n base in New Mexico. They use the land to raise stocker\n\fCase: 19-1901     Document: 40     Page: 3    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES                                  3\n\n\n\n calves. After the purchase, the complaint says, the Air\n Force began flying training missions over the land, some-\n times \u201cno more than 20 feet . . . off the deck.\u201d J.A. 28.\n     In October 2008, the Taylors entered into an agree-\n ment with Wind Energy. The agreement, which is at-\n tached to the complaint, granted Wind Energy an exclusive\n option for an easement, into and on the Taylors\u2019 property,\n for \u201cwind resource evaluation, wind energy development,\n energy transmission and related wind energy development\n uses.\u201d J.A. 38\u201362. The agreement provided Wind Energy\n five years (the \u201coption term\u201d) to exercise the easement op-\n tion, during which Wind Energy could terminate the agree-\n ment without fee, upon giving the Taylors appropriate\n notice. J.A. 38, 49.\n     In mid-2012, according to the complaint, employees of\n the Air Force on the nearby base suggested to Wind Energy\n that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would not\n issue a \u201cNo Hazard\u201d designation for the air space above the\n Taylors\u2019 land. J.A. 29\u201330. The absence of such a designa-\n tion, the complaint alleges, is \u201cfatal to the construction of\n planned wind turbines because other regulatory agencies\n will withhold permits for construction\u201d and \u201cfinancing be-\n comes impracticable.\u201d J.A. 29. On September 11, 2012,\n within the option term, Wind Energy exercised its contrac-\n tual right to terminate the agreement. J.A. 65. 1\n\n\n\n\n     1    Although the complaint contains a passing refer-\n ence to \u201cbreach\u201d by Wind Energy, J.A. 32, the Taylors ex-\n plained during oral argument in this court that they were\n not alleging that Wind Energy breached the contract\u2014\n which, by its terms, gave Wind Energy a right to terminate\n when and as it did, J.A. 49. Oral Argument at 6:40\u20137:18;\n see also J.A. 49. We read the complaint in accordance with\n that acknowledgment.\n\fCase: 19-1901    Document: 40      Page: 4    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                   TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n      On July 25, 2018, the Taylors sued the United States\n in the Court of Federal Claims. Fairly read, and as under-\n stood in the trial court, the complaint makes two claims:\n (1) the government effected a regulatory taking of the Tay-\n lors\u2019 property interest in its contract with Wind Energy\n when Air Force personnel led Wind Energy to terminate\n the contract by suggesting that the FAA would not issue a\n \u201cNo Hazard\u201d designation; (2) the Air Force\u2019s flyovers ef-\n fected a physical taking of their property interest in the\n land and associated air space. The government filed a mo-\n tion to dismiss under Court of Federal Claims Rule 12(b)(1)\n for \u201clack of subject-matter jurisdiction\u201d and under Rule\n 12(b)(6) for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can\n be granted.\u201d The trial court granted the motion and dis-\n missed the complaint. Taylor v. United States, 142 Fed. Cl.\n 464 (2019). The trial court dismissed the regulatory-taking\n claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and also for\n failure to state a claim.

UNITED STATES                                  5\n\n\n\n pleaded factual allegations as true.     Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).\n                              A\n     At the outset, we reject the trial court\u2019s holding that\n the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the Tay-\n lors\u2019 regulatory-taking claim. Taylor, 142 Fed. Cl. at 470\u2013\n 72. The Tucker Act gives the Court of Federal Claims \u201cju-\n risdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the\n United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any\n Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive depart-\n ment, or upon any express or implied contract with the\n United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in\n cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). The\n trial court held that it lacked jurisdiction, despite the ex-\n press allegation of a claim founded on the Takings Clause\n of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, because the\n complaint also describes the Air Force actions at issue as\n meeting the elements of a state-law tort. Taylor, 142 Fed.\n Cl. at 470\u201372. But we have rejected such a rationale for\n denying Tucker Act jurisdiction.\n     As a substantive-law matter, we have recognized that\n \u201cthe same operative facts may give rise to both a taking and\n a tort.\u201d Moden v. United States, 404 F.3d 1335, 1339 n.1\n (Fed. Cir. 2005) (relying on City of Monterey v. Del Monte\n Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 717 (1999), and\n other cases). And in El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries\n Co. v. United States, we specifically held that Tucker Act\n jurisdiction existed over a complaint that asserted a taking\n claim notwithstanding that the complaint also character-\n ized the same government conduct as tortious. 378 F.3d\n 1346, 1353\u201354 (Fed. Cir. 2004). We noted that the com-\n plaint invoked the Takings Clause and sought a remedy\n under that clause, and we concluded: \u201cThat the complaint\n suggests the United States may have acted tortiously to-\n wards the appellants does not remove it from the jurisdic-\n tion of the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d Id. at 1353. We\n\fCase: 19-1901     Document: 40     Page: 6     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                    TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n explained that, even if the complaint\u2019s tort characterization\n made the complaint a \u201cmultipurpose\u201d one, \u201c[t]he multipur-\n pose nature of the complaint did not deprive the Court of\n Federal Claims of jurisdiction to entertain the takings\n claim alleged therein.\u201d Id. at 1354. In so ruling, we applied\n to a tort-taking overlap the dual-wrong rationale of Del-Rio\n Drilling Programs, Inc. v. United States, 146 F.3d 1358,\n 1363\u201364 (Fed. Cir. 1998), and Rith Energy, Inc. v. United\n States, 247 F.3d 1355, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001).\n     That precedent applies to this case. The Taylors chose\n to challenge the alleged Air Force action as a Fifth Amend-\n ment taking of their property interest in the Wind Energy\n contract. There is \u201cample precedent for acknowledging a\n property interest in contract rights under the Fifth Amend-\n ment.\u201d Cienega Gardens v. United States, 331 F.3d 1319,\n 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Lynch v. United States,\n 292 U.S. 571, 579 (1934) (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment com-\n mands that property be not taken without making just\n compensation. Valid contracts are property, whether the\n obligor be a private individual, a municipality, a state, or\n the United States.\u201d). That the complaint also indicates\n that the Air Force action constituted tortious interference\n with a contract does not remove the taking claim from the\n jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the\n Tucker Act. 2\n\n\n\n\n     2   This case does not involve a situation in which the\n conduct alleged is a tort that, as a matter of law, is not a\n taking. In this respect, the case differs from the allegations\n of patent infringement against the federal government at\n issue in Schillinger v. United States, 155 U.S. 163 (1894).\n See Golden v. United States, 955 F.3d 981, 986\u201388\n (Fed. Cir. 2020).\n\fCase: 19-1901     Document: 40     Page: 7    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES                                  7\n\n\n\n                              B\n      The Taylors\u2019 regulatory-taking claim nevertheless fails\n on the merits as a matter of law. The Taylors invoke the\n standards for a regulatory taking that call for \u201cad hoc, fac-\n tual inquiries into the circumstances of each particular\n case.\u201d Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 475 U.S.\n 211, 224 (1986). In Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City\n of New York, the Supreme Court considered three factors:\n (1) \u201c[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claim-\n ant\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to which the regulation has interfered\n with distinct investment-backed expectations\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe\n character of the government action.\u201d 438 U.S. 104, 124\n (1978); see also Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986,\n 1005 (1984) (considering \u201creasonable investment-backed\n expectations\u201d). We conclude that the Taylors\u2019 regulatory-\n taking claim cannot pass muster under those standards,\n even without further factual inquiry.\n                              1\n     The first factor, the economic impact of the regulation\n on the Taylors, weighs so strongly against finding a regu-\n latory taking that it might be decisive on its own\u2014some-\n thing we need not decide because the full three-factor\n analysis leads to the same conclusion. As we have noted,\n the Taylors acknowledge that Wind Energy\u2019s termination\n was not a breach of the agreement it had with the Taylors.\n The Taylors thus have not identified Fifth Amendment\n property in the form of \u201ccontract rights\u201d against their con-\n tract counterparty (Wind Energy) that have been taken\n from them. Cienega Gardens, 331 F.3d at 1329 (emphasis\n added). And they have not identified any takings law that\n treats as a protected form of \u201cproperty\u201d a person\u2019s interest\n in the benefits of a contract that the counterparty may\n freely terminate (and, here, terminated without any plau-\n sible allegation of government coercion). At a minimum, in\n resting their regulatory-taking claim entirely on alleged\n harm to their contractual relationship, the Taylors\u2019\n\fCase: 19-1901    Document: 40      Page: 8    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                   TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n complaint contains no allegation of any material harm to a\n constitutionally protected aspect of that relationship. 3\n                              2\n      The second factor, the extent to which the regulation\n interferes with the Taylors\u2019 distinct, reasonable invest-\n ment-backed expectations, also weighs against finding a\n regulatory taking. Although the regulatory-taking claim is\n focused entirely on the loss of the hoped-for benefits of the\n 2008 Wind Energy contract, the complaint states no facts\n indicating that the Taylors made any investment specifi-\n cally related to that contract. The only investment re-\n flected in the complaint is the purchase of the land in 1999.\n And even as to that, the complaint does not allege that the\n purchase was made with any expectation as to use of the\n property for harvesting wind energy. There are no mate-\n rial \u201cdistinct investment-backed expectation[s].\u201d Penn\n Central, 438 U.S. at 124.\n      Besides lacking support for an inference of investment-\n backed expectations regarding wind energy, the Taylors\u2019\n claim supports no inference of reasonable expectations as\n to freedom from regulatory actions that might adversely af-\n fect use of the land for harvesting wind energy. We have\n\n\n\n     3    The Takings Clause\u2019s focus on particular property\n interests is reflected in the longstanding rule that the\n clause does not provide for compensation for \u201cconsequential\n losses.\u201d United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S.\n 373, 379\u201380 (1945) (\u201cThe rule in [a takings] case is that\n compensation for that [property] interest does not include\n . . . consequential losses.\u201d); see Mitchell v. United States,\n 267 U.S. 341, 345 (1925) (\u201cThe settled rules of law however,\n precluded his considering in that determination conse-\n quential damages for losses to their business, or for its de-\n struction.\u201d); cf. Monongahela Navigation Corp. v. United\n States, 148 U.S. 312, 326 (1893).\n\fCase: 19-1901      Document: 40      Page: 9     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES                                       9\n\n\n\n articulated three considerations relevant to that issue:\n (a) \u201cwhether the plaintiff operated in a \u2018highly regulated\n industry\u2019\u201d; (b) \u201cwhether the plaintiff was aware of the prob-\n lem that spawned the regulation at the time it purchased\n the allegedly taken property\u201d; and (c) \u201cwhether the plaintiff\n could have \u2018reasonably anticipated\u2019 the possibility of such\n regulation in light of the \u2018regulatory environment\u2019 at the\n time of purchase.\u201d Appolo Fuels, Inc. v. United States,\n 381 F.3d 1338, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting Common-\n wealth Edison Co. v. United States, 271 F.3d 1327, 1348\n (Fed. Cir. 2001) (en banc)); see Reoforce, Inc. v. United\n States, 853 F.3d 1249, 1270 (Fed. Cir. 2017). All three con-\n siderations weigh against the Taylors.\n     Airspace used for aircraft is highly regulated. See\n 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40103(b)(1) (The FAA \u201cshall develop plans and\n policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by\n regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to en-\n sure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of air-\n space.\u201d); see also 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44718(a)(1) (\u201c[T]he Secretary\n of Transportation shall require a person to give adequate\n public notice . . . of the construction . . . of a structure . . .\n when the notice will promote . . . safety in air commerce.\u201d).\n Such strict regulation weighs against the Taylors\u2019 claim,\n although \u201c[a] property owner does not automatically relin-\n quish her Fifth Amendment rights by entering a highly\n regulated industry,\u201d Reoforce, 853 F.3d at 1270; see Ruckel-\n shaus, 467 U.S. at 990 (finding regulatory taking in an in-\n dustry \u201cregulated . . . for nearly 75 years.\u201d). Moreover, at\n the time the Taylors contracted with Wind Energy in 2008,\n they knew that the Air Force flew \u201ctraining missions, some-\n times no more than 20 feet . . . off the deck.\u201d J.A. 28 \u00b6 12.\n The FAA regulations regarding hazard designations were\n also in place long before the Taylors purchased the prop-\n erty in 1999. See, e.g., Flowers Mill Assoc. v. United States,\n 23 Cl. Ct. 182, 186 (1991) (discussion of FAA No Hazard\n designations). When buying the land at issue, located near\n an Air Force base, the Taylors should have \u201creasonably\n\fCase: 19-1901    Document: 40     Page: 10     Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                  TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n anticipated\u201d that the FAA might not issue a No Hazard\n designation for their land. Thus, the Taylors\u2019 distinct in-\n vestment-backed expectations weigh against finding a reg-\n ulatory taking.\n                              3\n     The third Penn Central factor, the character of the gov-\n ernment action, also weighs against finding a regulatory\n taking here. The action at issue is not the denial of a No\n Hazard designation. Rather, it is Air Force employees\u2019 giv-\n ing of information and advice to Wind Energy suggesting\n that the FAA would not issue a No Hazard designation. See\n J.A. 18, 29\u201330; see also Oral Argument at 8:52\u20139:02 (\u201cIt\u2019s\n not that the FAA gave some sort of presumption of\n [whether a No Hazard designation would issue], it\u2019s that\n the Air Force said [that] this is not going to be forthcom-\n ing.\u201d).\n     That action falls into no category of government action\n we have recognized as supporting a regulatory-taking\n claim. It is not even the action of the FAA, which was not\n asked by Wind Energy or the Taylors for a No Hazard des-\n ignation. The challenged action by Air Force personnel did\n not have a \u201clegal effect or impose a direct legal obligation\n on any party.\u201d Dimare Fresh, Inc. v. United States,\n 808 F.3d 1301, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2015). It was not a form of\n coercive government action at all, but at most a form of\n \u201cpersuasion,\u201d convincing Wind Energy of something assert-\n edly relevant to its prospects for having air clearance for\n contemplated wind towers. A&D Auto Sales, Inc. v. United\n States, 748 F.3d 1142, 1154 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\u201cThe line be-\n tween coercion (which may create takings liability) and\n persuasion (which does not create takings liability) is\n highly fact-specific and hardly simple to determine.\u201d). And\n there is no issue here of a withholding of specifically prom-\n ised government approval after large investments were\n made on the basis of the promise. See United Nuclear Corp.\n v. United States, 912 F.2d 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1990).\n\fCase: 19-1901     Document: 40      Page: 11   Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAYLOR   v. UNITED STATES                                 11\n\n\n\n      The character of the government action counts against\n finding a taking. The Taylors cannot deny that the action\n was within the \u201cauthority\u201d of those who took it; such a de-\n nial would defeat their taking claim. 4 The dissemination\n of information is a legitimate agency function, especially in\n the context of public safety. See Dimare Fresh, 808 F.3d\n at 1311. And we have already held that there are good rea-\n sons for caution about subjecting agency information dis-\n closures, even informal disclosures, to the risk of takings\n liability, especially when there are alternative means of\n checking harmful disclosures. Id. at 1309\u201312.\n     In sum, each of the Penn Central factors weighs\n strongly against finding a regulatory taking. Together\n they mean that the Taylors\u2019 claim, on the allegations of\n their complaint, cannot succeed as a matter of law.\n                              III\n                              A\n     The complaint in this case also alleges that the govern-\n ment\u2019s overflights have effected a physical taking of the\n Taylors\u2019 \u201ccompensable property interests in the air space\n above their fee property.\u201d J.A. 31 \u00b6 29. The trial court con-\n cluded that the complaint provides legally insufficient\n\n\n     4   A government action cannot be a taking if \u201cthe ad-\n ministrative agency lacked the authority to regulate the\n property it \u2018appropriated,\u2019\u201d Dimare Fresh, 808 F.3d at 1308,\n or, more generally, if the government actors lacked the \u201cau-\n thority\u201d to take the action, Del-Rio Drilling, 146 F.3d\n at 1362 (explaining nature of \u201cauthority\u201d rule). See United\n States v. N. American Transp. & Trading Co., 253 U.S. 330,\n 333 (1920) (\u201cIn order that the government shall be liable it\n must appear that the officer who has physically taken pos-\n session of the property was duly authorized so to do.\u201d); Fla.\n Rock Indus., Inc. v.

UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n factual support to survive a motion to dismiss the asserted\n physical-taking claim. Taylor, 142 Fed. Cl. at 473. We\n agree.\n     Under United States v. Causby, \u201c[f]lights over private\n land are not a taking, unless they are so low and so fre-\n quent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the\n enjoyment and use of the land.\u201d 328 U.S. 256, 266 (1946).\n In applying that standard for finding an imposition of an\n \u201cavigation easement,\u201d we have considered (1) whether the\n planes flew directly over the claimant\u2019s land; (2) whether\n the flights were low and frequent; and (3) whether the\n flights directly, immediately, and substantially interfered\n with the claimant\u2019s enjoyment and use of the land. Brown\n v. United States, 73 F.3d 1100, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The\n Taylors\u2019 complaint sufficiently alleges the first factor, but\n not the others.\n     The Taylors allege that \u201cmilitary aircraft regularly fly\n training routes at altitudes below . . . 500 feet [above\n ground level] over [the Taylors\u2019] property.\u201d J.A. 30 \u00b6 22.\n The trial court determined that the Taylors did not \u201callege\n that the flights were frequent enough to state a claim for\n an avigation easement.\u201d Taylor, 142 Fed. Cl. at 473. In the\n absence of greater specificity, \u201cregularly\u201d is not a factual\n allegation that can support an inference of the required fre-\n quency. There are no further allegations of how often\n flights occur.\n      Nor have the Taylors provided any factual allegations\n of how the flights \u201cdirectly, immediately, and substantially\n interfere\u201d with their quiet enjoyment and use of the land.\n The complaint describes the Taylors\u2019 ranch operations as\n the \u201cbuying and straightening out [of] stocker calves\u201d but\n fails to allege how the overflights affect those operations.\n J.A. 28 \u00b6 8. The complaint simply pleads that the Air Force\n \u201cengage[s] in conduct and actions to inversely condemn the\n Taylor[s\u2019] compensable property interest in the air space\n above their private property and the quiet enjoyment of the\n\fCase: 19-1901     Document: 40      Page: 13    Filed: 05/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n TAYLOR   v.

Therefore, the Taylors\n failed to state a claim for a physical taking.\n                                B\n     The trial court dismissed the Taylors\u2019 physical-taking\n claim. Taylor, 142 Fed. Cl. at 474 (\u201c[T]he Court grants the\n Government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss as to all [the Taylors\u2019]\n claims.\u201d (capitalization altered)). The Taylors argue that\n we should vacate the dismissal and remand to allow them\n to amend their complaint. The trial court, however, did not\n abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint.\n       Court of Federal Claims Rule 15(a)\u2014which is identical\n in all material respects to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n 15(a)\u2014prescribes when a party may amend its pleadings\n before trial.

Several years later, the Taylors entered into\n an agreement with Wind Energy Prototypes, LLC, giving\n the company an exclusive option to obtain an easement it\n could use to build and operate structures to collect energy\n from wind. The Taylors allege that during the term of the\n option, employees of the Air Force informally advised Wind\n Energy that the Federal Aviation Administration would\n not issue a No Hazard designation for such structures on\n the land. Thereafter, Wind Energy, rather than exercising\n the option, terminated the contract with the Taylors, a de-\n cision that the Taylors acknowledge was permitted by their\n contract with Wind Energy.\n     The Taylors sued the federal government in the Court\n of Federal Claims. The complaint is properly understood\n as making essentially two claims\u2014that the Air Force\u2019s in-\n formal advice to Wind Energy effected a regulatory taking\n of the Taylors\u2019 property interest in their contract with\n Wind Energy, and that the Air Force\u2019s flyovers effected a\n physical taking of their property interest in their land and\n associated air space. The trial court dismissed the com-\n plaint, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over the regu-\n latory-taking claim and, on the merits, that both taking\n claims failed to state a claim on which relief could be\n granted. We reverse the jurisdictional ruling but affirm\n the dismissal on the merits.\n                               I\n    The complaint alleges that in 1999 the Taylors pur-\n chased a large plot of land near a United States Air Force\n base in New Mexico.

The agreement, which is at-\n tached to the complaint, granted Wind Energy an exclusive\n option for an easement, into and on the Taylors\u2019 property,\n for \u201cwind resource evaluation, wind energy development,\n energy transmission and related wind energy development\n uses.\u201d J.A. 38\u201362. The agreement provided Wind Energy\n five years (the \u201coption term\u201d) to exercise the easement op-\n tion, during which Wind Energy could terminate the agree-\n ment without fee, upon giving the Taylors appropriate\n notice. J.A. 38, 49.\n     In mid-2012, according to the complaint, employees of\n the Air Force on the nearby base suggested to Wind Energy\n that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would not\n issue a \u201cNo Hazard\u201d designation for the air space above the\n Taylors\u2019 land. J.A. 29\u201330. The absence of such a designa-\n tion, the complaint alleges, is \u201cfatal to the construction of\n planned wind turbines because other regulatory agencies\n will withhold permits for construction\u201d and \u201cfinancing be-\n comes impracticable.\u201d J.A. 29.
