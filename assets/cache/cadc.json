Martens Jr.,\nSpecial Assistant U.S. Attorney, entered an appearance.\n\n    Before: TATEL, PILLARD, and WILKINS, Circuit Judges.\n\n    Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge PILLARD.\n\n     PILLARD , Circuit Judge: Lieutenant Christopher Code\nasked the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records\n(the Board or ABCMR) to expunge or amend Army\ninvestigators\u2019 determinations recorded in his military files.\nThe records at issue stated that credible information and\nprobable cause existed to believe that Code committed the\ncriminal offenses of making a false official statement with\nintent to deceive and obtaining services under false pretenses.\nThe allegedly false statement was the expiration date of Code\u2019s\ncurrent military orders, which he wrote in a blank on the 2007-\n2008 school year registration form to re-enroll his three\nchildren at the Fort Buchanan base school that they had\nattended since 2005. The Secretary of the Army claims Code\u2019s\nprovision of that date was a false pretense that he used to obtain\nan additional year of schooling for his children when, the Army\nalleges, Code knew they were not entitled to that service.\n\n     When Code filled out the school form on April 30, 2007,\nhe was under orders assigning him to Fort Buchanan for three\nyears, from July 2005 to July 2008. Where the school\nregistration form stated \u201cI am active duty and my current orders\nwill expire on _____,\u201d Code filled in \u201cJuly 2008.\u201d Army\ninvestigators apparently at first believed Code\u2019s assignment\nwas for two years, not three; they opened a fraud investigation\non that premise. It is by now undisputed, however, that the\nassignment was for three years. The investigation did not lead\nto any criminal prosecution or military discipline. Yet, when\nCode sought to have the allegations and charges removed from\n\f                                3\nhis military records, the Board denied his application and the\ndistrict court sustained its decision. Because a basic mistake of\nfact renders the Board\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious, we\nreverse.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\n\nA. Legal Context\n\n     The U.S. Department of Defense operates elementary and\nsecondary schools to serve families of individuals who live\nand/or work on military installations where appropriate local\nfree public education is not available to their dependents. See\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2164(a)(1)-(2); Department of Defense Instruction\n(DoDI) 1342.26 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6.2 (1997). The children of active duty\nmilitary members, including those who live outside such an\ninstallation, may receive \u201ctuition-free education at an\ninstallation.\u201d DoDI 1342.26 \u00b6\u00b6 6.2.1.1, 6.2.2.1. Eligibility for\ntuition-free education is \u201cbased upon the permanent duty\nstation to which the military sponsor [e.g., the parent] is\nassigned by official orders.\u201d Id. \u00b6 6.3.3. Anticipating possible\nchanges in a sponsor\u2019s duty station, the governing statute and\npolicy provide that, \u201c[i]f the status of the sponsor of a currently\nenrolled student changes so that the child would no longer be\neligible for enrollment\u201d at the military installation\u2019s school,\n\u201cenrollment may continue for the remainder of the school\nyear.\u201d Id. \u00b6 6.3.7; see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2164(h)(1) (\u201cThe Secretary\nof Defense shall permit a dependent of a member of the armed\nforces . . . to continue enrollment in an educational program\nprovided by the Secretary . . . for the remainder of a school year\nnotwithstanding a change during such school year in the status\nof the member . . . that, except for this paragraph, would\notherwise terminate the eligibility of the dependent to be\nenrolled in the program.\u201d).\n\f                               4\n     Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), a\nperson commits the offense of making a false official statement\nwhen he, \u201cwith intent to deceive[,] (1) signs any false record,\nreturn, regulation, order, or other official document, knowing\nit to be false; or (2) makes any other false official statement\nknowing it to be false.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 907(a). A person commits\nlarceny under the UCMJ when he \u201cwrongfully takes, obtains,\nor withholds, by any means, from the possession of the owner\nor of any other person any money, personal property, or article\nof value . . . with intent permanently to deprive or defraud\nanother person of the use and benefit of property or to\nappropriate it\u201d for his own use or use by another. Id.\n\u00a7 921(a)(1). The UCMJ also makes it a criminal offense to,\n\u201cwith intent to defraud, knowingly use[] false pretenses to\nobtain services.\u201d Id. \u00a7 921b. As relevant here, all three\noffenses require proof of wrongful intent, and both false\nstatement and false pretenses specifically require intent to\ndefraud.\n\n      As soon as a Department of Defense Criminal\nInvestigative Organization has \u201ccredible information that\u201d the\nsubject of an investigation \u201ccommitted a criminal offense,\u201d it\nmust place the subject\u2019s name and identifying information in\nthe title block of an investigative report\u2014a step known as\n\u201ctitling.\u201d DoDI 5505.7 \u00b6\u00b6 6.1, 6.5 (2003). The Department of\nDefense defines credible information as \u201c[i]nformation\ndisclosed or obtained by a criminal investigator that,\nconsidering the source and nature of the information and the\ntotality of the circumstances, is sufficiently believable to lead\na trained investigator to presume that the fact or facts in\nquestion are true.\u201d Id. \u00b6 E1.1.1. Concurrent with titling, the\ninvestigative organization must list the subject\u2019s name in the\nDefense Central Index of Investigations (DCII), a searchable\ndatabase used by the Department of Defense\u2019s security and\ninvestigative agencies and selected other federal agencies \u201cto\n\f                                5\ndetermine security clearance status and the existence/physical\nlocation of criminal and personnel security investigative files.\u201d\nId. \u00b6 E1.1.3.

If\ninvestigators determine that no crime was committed, the\noffense is reported as \u201cunfounded.\u201d See Army Regulation\n190-45 Glossary \u00a7 II, \u201cUnfounded offense.\u201d\n\n     Individuals who believe their military file contains an error\nmay request that the Secretary of the military department that\ncreated the record make corrections to it. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552.\nSecretaries generally rely on civilian boards to review and act\non requests for correction. Id. \u00a7 1552(a)(1). The Secretary of\nthe Army reviews correction applications through the Army\nBoard for the Correction of Military Records, a board of\ncivilians \u201cvested with broad authority to \u2018correct any military\nrecord when it considers it necessary to correct an error or\nremove an injustice.\u2019\u201d Wolfe v.

Factual Record\n\n     Christopher Code was an officer in the U.S. Navy and is\nnow a member of the Navy Reserve. On July 25, 2005, Code\nbegan a three-year tour of duty at Fort Buchanan Army Base in\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico. See Navy Personnel Command,\nOfficial Change Duty Orders for Lt Christopher John Code\n(Jan. 24, 2005) (J.A. 421); Memorandum from the Dep\u2019t of\nDef., San Juan Military Entrance Processing Station, to Fort\nBuchanan Family Hous. (July 25, 2005) (J.A. 471); Code v.\nEsper, 285 F. Supp. 3d 58, 61-62 (D.D.C. 2017); Appellee\u2019s\nBr. 10. During that tour of duty, Code and his family lived in\noff-base housing and his three children attended the\nDepartment of Defense school at the Fort Buchanan base.\n\n     Sometime between January and March of 2007, Code\nlearned that he was likely to receive new \u201cpermanent change of\nstation\u201d orders assigning him somewhere else before his\ncurrent orders assigning him to Puerto Rico expired in July\n2008. Fla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army CID, Agent\u2019s\nInvestigation Report (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 405); Code Decl. \u00b6 6\n(J.A. 455). Because his elderly father had only recently moved\nto live with Code\u2019s family in Puerto Rico, Code\u2019s preference\n\f                               7\nwas to remain at Fort Buchanan for the full three years if\npossible. With the support of his superiors, Code applied on\nMarch 12, 2007, for a one-month extension of his then-current\norders which, if granted, would keep him at Fort Buchanan\nthrough August 2008.\n\n     In a letter dated Thursday, April 26, 2007, the Navy\u2019s\ndepartment of human resources denied the extension request,\ndescribing it as a request for a \u201cthirteen-month extension.\u201d\nLetter from Head, Human Res. Cmty., to Lt. Christopher Code\n(Apr. 26, 2007) (J.A. 430). Code asserts, and the Secretary\ndoes not dispute, that he did not receive the denial letter until\nTuesday, May 8, 2007, as evidenced by a faxed copy of the\nletter with a heading showing the date of May 8, 2007.\n\n     Meanwhile, Code\u2019s three children were attending the Fort\nBuchanan school, where they had been enrolled since Code\u2019s\ntour in Puerto Rico began in 2005. Registration for the\nupcoming school year was in progress. See Oral Arg. Rec.\n22:13-37; see also DoDI 1342.26 \u00b6 6.3.4.3 (referencing May\nenrollment deadline). On Monday, April 30, 2007, Code\nsubmitted an application to reenroll the children for the 2007-\n2008 school year. Where the enrollment form stated: \u201cI am\nactive duty and my current orders will expire on _____,\u201d Code\nfilled in \u201cJuly 2008,\u201d as he presumably had done each of the\nprior two years. Suppl. DoDEA Form 600 \u2013 School Year\n2007-2008 (Apr. 30, 2007) (J.A. 223). The form also stated\nthat \u201cif my orders change/terminate before the start of the SY\n2007-2008, I will notify the registrar immediately.\u201d Id.\nAlthough Code did not sign his name on the line appearing next\nto that statement, he signed the bottom of the form, under a\nstatement averring the veracity of information provided.\n\n    As Code later explained under oath, \u201c[a]t the time I\nsubmitted the paperwork, I did not yet know that my request\n\f                               8\nfor extension had been denied and still believed that my\nextension request would be granted.\u201d Code Decl. \u00b6 7 (J.A.\n456). But school enrollment forms were due, and there is no\ncontention that the Code family was rushing to submit theirs\nearly. See Oral Arg. Rec. 22:13-37. As of April\u2014the same\ntime of year the Code family had applied the prior year\u2014the\nschool was urging parents of currently enrolled children to\nsubmit any 2007 reenrollment forms. Code\u2019s wife told the\nschool\u2019s Registrar of the possibility that Code would receive\nearly change orders, in advance of his current orders\u2019 July 2008\nexpiration date. Code attests that the Registrar \u201cadvised my\nwife that my children\u2019s eligibility to attend the [Fort] Buchanan\nschool for the 2007-2008 term was tied to my current orders,\nwhich at that point still had me stationed in San Juan through\nJuly 2008.\u201d Code Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A. 456).\n\n     On May 23, 2007, Code received change-of-station orders\ndirecting him to report for duty in Kingsville, Texas, in June\n2007. Code attests that, \u201c[i]mmediately upon receipt\u201d of his\nnew orders, he notified the Registrar, who assured him that the\nchildren could stay at the Fort Buchanan school, because\n\u201celigibility was based on my Orders at the time of enrollment.\u201d\nId. \u00b6 9; Suppl. Code Decl. \u00b6 2 (J.A. 497). Pursuant to his\norders, Code reported to Kingsville in June 2007. His wife and\nchildren, together with Code\u2019s father, remained in Puerto Rico\nfor the time being, and the children attended the Fort Buchanan\nschool during the 2007-2008 school year.\n\n     In November 2007, base police in Puerto Rico became\naware that the Code children were attending the Fort Buchanan\nschool while Code was stationed elsewhere. In January 2008,\nthe Florida Fraud Resident Agency of the U.S. Army Criminal\nInvestigation Command (known as the \u201cCID\u201d because it was\nformerly called the Criminal Investigation Division) opened an\ninvestigation into whether Code\u2019s children were fraudulently\n\f                                 9\nenrolled in the Fort Buchanan school. The Army CID first\ninterviewed an unnamed First Sergeant at the Military Entrance\nand Processing Station at Fort Buchanan. The First Sergeant\nerroneously informed the CID that the orders assigning Code\nto Fort Buchanan, which were in effect when Code completed\nthe school enrollment form, expired \u201csometime during the\nsummer months\u201d of 2007. Fla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army\nCID, Agent\u2019s Investigation Report (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 405).\nAs noted above, it is undisputed that Code\u2019s current orders at\nthe time he submitted the form assigned him to Fort Buchanan\nuntil July 2008.\n\n     Without yet having contacted Code, the Army CID\ninterviewed the Fort Buchanan school Registrar on January 25,\n2008. There is no record whether the investigator asked about\nthe Registrar\u2019s actual conversations with Code or his wife. The\ninterview report reflects only that the Army CID presented to\nthe Registrar hypothetically \u201cthe scenario involving Lt. Code.\u201d\nFla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army CID, Agent\u2019s Investigation\nReport (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 404). The Registrar responded\nwith her then-current understanding that (in retrospect) she\nbelieved Code\u2019s children would have been ineligible to register\nfor or attend the school \u201csince the sponsor, Lt. Code was no\nlonger assigned or stationed in Puerto Rico.\u201d Id. She then\nstated that Code did not fit any applicable exceptions, including\nan exception that she described as allowing children to \u201cfinish\nthe school year, if the school year was in progress (Sep[tember]\nthrough May)\u201d when the sponsor received new orders. Id. She\nappears to have been referring to the rule providing that \u201c[i]f\nthe status of the sponsor of a currently enrolled student changes\nso that the child would no longer be eligible for enrollment . . . ,\nenrollment may continue for the remainder of the school year.\u201d\nDoDI 1342.26 \u00b6 6.3.7; see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2164(h)(1).\n\f                               10\n     In late July 2009, the Army CID also queried by email the\nNavy human resources officer who had sent Code the April 26,\n2007, letter notifying him that his extension request had been\ndenied. The Army CID wished to know \u201cthe date Lt. Code\nreceived the letter of denial,\u201d given \u201cthe closeness on the dates\nof the false statement (30 Apr 07) and the date of the letter of\ndenial of extension (26 Apr 07).\u201d Fla. Fraud Resident Agency,\nArmy CID, Agent\u2019s Investigation Report (July 30, 2009) (J.A.\n441). The officer responded:\n\n    If you are trying to prove that he intentionally\n    defrauded the local school by saying he thought his\n    extension was approved, I can affirm with absolute\n    confidence that I personally told him otherwise\n    within no more than a few days after the date on\n    letter, and certainly we issued him transfer orders,\n    which presumably he executed, which once again\n    would indicate that he knew he was no longer\n    eligible to use the school.\n\nId. (J.A. 441-42).\n\n     At some point during the investigation, the Army CID\nobtained a copy of Code\u2019s orders assigning him to Fort\nBuchanan in July 2005. Those orders, as confirmed by Code\u2019s\ncommanding officer when he signed in for duty, authoritatively\nestablished that Code was assigned to Fort Buchanan from July\n25, 2005, until July 25, 2008. See Navy Personnel Command,\nOfficial Change Duty Orders for Lt Christopher John Code\n(Jan. 24, 2005) (J.A. 421); Memorandum from the Dep\u2019t of\nDef., San Juan Military Entrance Processing Station, to Fort\nBuchanan Family Hous. (July 25, 2005) (J.A. 471) (copy of\nmemorandum from Code\u2019s commanding officer certifying that\nCode\u2019s \u201ctour is from July 25, 2005, to July 25, 2008\u201d). The\ndistrict court found that that the Army CID\u2019s description of\n\f                               11\nCode\u2019s tour as a \u201ctwenty-four month tour, ending in the\nsummer of 2007 . . . does not appear to have been an accurate\ndescription of [Code\u2019s] orders\u201d because his \u201ctour in Puerto\nRico was initially scheduled to last for three years, concluding\nin the summer of 2008,\u201d and specifically noted that Code\u2019s\norders expired in July 2008. Code, 285 F. Supp. 3d at 62. The\nSecretary\u2019s own brief tells us that Code\u2019s \u201ctour of duty in\nPuerto Rico was to be from August 2005 until July 2008\u201d and\nthat Navy personnel advised Code he would receive new\nchange of station orders before his \u201ccurrent orders expired in\nJuly 2008.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 10 (quoting J.A. 471). At oral\nargument, counsel for the Secretary confirmed that Code\u2019s\norders \u201cexpired on [their] face, by [their] terms . . . in 2008,\u201d\nand that the Secretary did not \u201ccontest[] that, in fact, Lt. Code\nwas given orders to be at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, initially\n. . . [until] 2008.\u201d Oral Arg. Rec. 16:26-35, 17:27-42. Those\nwere Code\u2019s \u201ccurrent orders\u201d until his tour of duty was cut\nshort by issuance on May 23, 2007, of Permanent Change of\nStation orders sending him to the Naval Air Station at\nKingsville, Texas.\n\n     Nonetheless, as the Army CID later summed up its\nreasoning, \u201cMr. Code was aware, or should have been aware\nthat his dependents were not authorized [sic] the services,\nwhich is why he would have provided the false date to ensure\nhis dependents could enroll.\u201d Memorandum from the Army\nCID to Director, Army Review Bds. Agency, at 2 (May 26,\n2016) (J.A. 314). The Army CID stressed that this was \u201cre-\niterated\u201d by the CID at its February 2008 interview with Code.\nId.\n\n    The children openly attended the Fort Buchanan school\nthroughout the 2007-2008 school year. The school is run by\nthe Department of Defense, which manages its enrollment\naccording to priorities established by Department of Defense\n\f                               12\nregulation. See DoDI 1342.26 \u00b6 6.2.2. The February 2008\ninterview was the first that Code learned about any potential\nproblem with his children\u2019s enrollment. See Code Decl. \u00b6 10\n(J.A. 456). There is no evidence that the school at any point\u2014\neither before or after the CID\u2019s February 2008 interview with\nCode\u2014asked the family to remove the children from the school\nor otherwise took steps to exclude them.\n\n     In its earliest report in the record, the Army CID stated on\nJuly 30, 2009, that it had what it believed was both \u201ccredible\ninformation\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that Code made\na false statement on April 30, 2007, when he submitted the\napplication form to the Fort Buchanan school for his three\nchildren for the 2007-2008 school year. Based on Domestic\nDependent Elementary and Secondary School (DDESS)-\nPuerto Rico tuition rates, the Army CID calculated that the\n\u201cmonetary loss to the U.S. Government [was] $44,200.\u201d Army\nCID, Report of Investigation - 3rd Status, at 2 (July 30, 2009)\n(J.A. 227). The investigators referred the putative debt to the\nDefense Finance and Accounting Service for collection. On\nSeptember 30, 2010, the Accounting Service initiated debt\ncollection against Code.\n\n    The Army CID concluded its investigation on January 12,\n2011, issuing a final report that determined there was\n\n    [p]robable cause to believe Lt. Code committed the\n    offense of False Official Statement and Larceny\n    when he falsified documentation by registering his\n    three children in the DDESS for a year while he was\n    not assigned to the geographic area. Lt. Code\n    knowingly falsified these DDESS documents 4 days\n    after his Permanent Change of Station (PCS),\n    extension request was denied, transferring him from\n    Puerto Rico to Kingsville, TX.\n\f                               13\nArmy CID, Report of Investigation - Final, at 2 (Jan. 12, 2011)\n(J.A. 398-99). The Army CID noted that it had referred the\ncase to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in San Juan but that the U.S.\nAttorney had declined to prosecute, leaving to the Department\nof Defense and Code\u2019s chain of command whether to take any\naction against him. Defense Department personnel declined to\ntake any prosecutorial or disciplinary action.\n\nC. Procedural History\n\n     Code applied first to the Army CID itself, then to the Army\nBoard for Correction of Military Records, for expungement or\ncorrection of the Report of Investigation\u2014that is, to vacate the\nCID\u2019s titling and probable-cause determinations. Code\nexplained that he could not have made a false official statement\nbecause the registration form asked specifically and\nexclusively for the date of expiration of his \u201ccurrent orders,\u201d\nwhich, when he signed the registration form, he accurately\nstated were set to expire in July 2008.\n\n     The Army CID and Board nonetheless denied relief, and\nCode timely sought review in district court. The district court\nidentified several inadequacies in the Board\u2019s decision,\nincluding the Board\u2019s application of the wrong regulation to\ndetermine the eligibility of Code\u2019s children and its failure to\naddress Code\u2019s challenge to the Army CID\u2019s referral of the\ninvestigative report to the Defense Finance and Accounting\nService to initiate collection. Over Code\u2019s objection, the\ndistrict court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for voluntary\nremand to allow the Board to \u201caddress the inadequacies\u201d raised\nby Code\u2019s complaint. Code v. McHugh, 139 F. Supp. 3d 465,\n472 (D.D.C. 2015).\n\n    The Board issued a second decision reinstating and\nbolstering its initial decision of almost three years earlier. The\nBoard denied any relief in Code\u2019s favor, instead taking the\n\f                               14\noccasion to recommend that the Army CID amend the Report\nof Investigation to substitute a charge of obtaining services\nunder false pretenses for the inapposite larceny charge. See\nABCMR, Record of Proceedings (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 110).\nThe Board determined that, while the behavior the CID\nascribed to Code did not amount to larceny, Code could instead\nbe re-titled with, and have founded against him, an offense of\nobtaining     services under false pretenses, which\n\u201ccontemplate[s] the wrongful obtaining of services rather than\ntangible property.\u201d Id. \u00b6 19 (J.A. 141).\n\n     Code returned to the district court to pursue his claim that\nthe Board\u2019s denial of relief from the titling and probable-cause\ndeterminations was arbitrary and capricious. He continued to\ncontend that the Army CID lacked any evidence of a false\nstatement, given that \u201cthe information [Code] submitted on the\napplication was completely true and accurate.\u201d Am. Compl.\n\u00b6 2, Code v. Speer, No. 15-cv-31 (D.D.C. Apr. 13, 2017), ECF\nNo. 17.\n\n     Ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the\ndistrict court held \u201cthat there was nothing arbitrary, capricious\nor contrary to law about the [Board]\u2019s conclusion that there was\nsufficient evidence to support the CID\u2019s decision to title [Code]\nwith the charges of Obtaining Services under False Pretenses\nand Making a False Official Statement.\u201d Code, 285 F. Supp.\n3d at 61. The district court emphasized that both the CID and\nthe Board had concluded that Code\u2019s statement \u201cthat \u2018I am\nactive duty and my current orders will expire on July 2008\u2019\u201d\nwas \u201ca purposeful misrepresentation of the true nature of\n[Code\u2019s] orders because, at the time he made this statement,\n[Code] knew that his \u2018current orders\u2019 were actually going to\n\u2018expire\u2019 in the near future, and that he was going to be required\nto leave Puerto Rico long before 2008.\u201d Id. at 67. The district\n\f                               15\ncourt did not separately address Code\u2019s challenge to the\nprobable-cause determination.\n\n     On appeal, Code renews his contention that he made no\nfalse statement because, at the time he filled out and signed the\nschool enrollment form asking him for the date his \u201ccurrent\norders will expire,\u201d his current orders assigned him to Fort\nBuchanan until July 2008. He contends that the Board\u2019s failure\nto expunge or amend the titling, indexing, and probable-cause\nfinding was therefore arbitrary and capricious under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA).              See 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n                        DISCUSSION\n\n     Three principles control our review. First, \u201c[o]n review of\na district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in connection\nwith the appeal of a decision of the ABCMR [Army Board for\nCorrection of Military Records], we review the ABCMR\u2019s\ndecision de novo, applying the same standards as the district\ncourt\u201d and with \u201cno particular deference to the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\u201d Coburn v. McHugh, 679 F.3d 924, 929 (D.C.\nCir. 2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Second, \u201cunder section 706(2) of the [APA], this court\nshall \u2018set aside\u2019 the ABCMR\u2019s \u2018action, findings, and\nconclusions\u2019 regarding the correction of military records if they\nare \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\nnot in accordance with law.\u2019\u201d Haselwander v. McHugh, 774\nF.3d 990, 996 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)).\nThe Secretary\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion in administering the\ncorrection of military records\u201d does not obviate the APA\u2019s\nrequirement that administrative actions \u201cbe supported by\n\u2018reasoned decisionmaking.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Allentown Mack\nSales & Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998)); see\n\f                                16\nalso Kreis v. Sec\u2019y of the Air Force, 866 F.2d 1508, 1514 (D.C.\nCir. 1989).\n\n     Third, we have recognized that, \u201cwhen a military records\ncorrection board fails to correct an injustice clearly presented\nin the record before it, it is acting in violation of its statutory\nmandate under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552. And such a violation,\ncontrary to the evidence, is arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\nHaselwander, 774 F.3d at 996 (alterations omitted) (quoting\nYee v. United States, 512 F.2d 1383, 1387 (Ct. Cl. 1975)).\n\n     We also have noted that \u201c[a] Correction Board can only\nexercise its discretion for the benefit of the individual\nmember.\u201d Wolfe, 835 F.2d at 358. In view of that constraint,\nit is not clear that the Board acted within the scope of its\nauthority when it suggested that Code could be re-titled with a\nnew offense. But because Code does not press that argument,\nsee Oral Arg. Rec. 10:42-58, and prevails on other grounds, we\ndo not resolve it now.\n\nA. Probable Cause\n\n     The Secretary has forfeited any defense of the Army CID\u2019s\nprobable-cause determination. In neither its initial review nor\nits review on remand from the district court did the Board\nseparately address Code\u2019s contentions that the CID lacked\nprobable cause to conclude that he had committed fraud.\nRather than account for the Board\u2019s omissions, counsel for the\nSecretary asserts that it was Code who failed to preserve his\nchallenge to probable cause on summary judgment in the\ndistrict court. Oral Arg. Rec. 12:57-13:29. That is wrong. Not\nonly at summary judgment, but also at every other opportunity,\nCode has asked for the probable cause determination to be\nreversed or expunged\u2014and has challenged as arbitrary and\ncapricious the Board\u2019s failure to do so. See Appellant\u2019s\n\f                              17\nBr. 33-34; Pl.\u2019s Req. for Recons. at 1, Code v. Speer, No. 15-\ncv-31 (D.D.C.

Wible, Cohen Mohr LLP,\nto U.S. Army Crime Records Ctr., at 1 (Jan. 24, 2013) (J.A.\n389). We reverse the district court\u2019s decision insofar as it\ndeclines to hold arbitrary and capricious the Board\u2019s failure to\nengage with Code\u2019s challenge to the probable-cause\ndetermination.\n\n    In any case, for essentially the same reasons explained\nbelow in connection with the titling and indexing decision, the\nBoard\u2019s determination of probable cause to believe that Code\ndefrauded the Department of Defense cannot stand.\n\nB. Titling and Indexing\n\n     We hold arbitrary and capricious the Board\u2019s decision\naffirming the Army CID\u2019s titling and indexing decision.\n\n     1. Review of a titling and indexing decision is unusual,\nbut it is called for here by several circumstances particular to\nthis case.\n\n      First, the case appears before us without a record that\nseparately identifies whatever initial, presumably limited, body\nof evidence the Army CID relied on to decide to title and index\nCode for criminal fraud. Applicable regulations suggest that\ntitling is akin to a threshold reason-to-believe or reasonable-\nsuspicion standard, typically made at the very outset of an\n\f                               18\ninvestigation. As Department of Defense rules explain,\n\u201c[t]itling and indexing . . . shall be done as early in the\ninvestigation as it is determined that credible information exists\nthat the subject committed a criminal offense.\u201d DoDI 5505.7\n\u00b6 6.1. The earliest determination in the record before us,\nhowever, is reflected in the July 30, 2009, Report of\nInvestigation, in which the titling and probable cause\ndeterminations are merged. That Report was \u201cgenerated to\ncorrect identifying on the subject [sic], change the offenses\nfrom U.S. Code to UCMJ, and list the offenses as founded.\u201d\nArmy CID, Report of Investigation - 3rd Status, at 2 (July 30,\n2009) (J.A. 225). We have no record of any threshold titling\nand indexing determination apart from and in advance of the\nReport that also found probable cause, nor has the Secretary\nexplained how we might otherwise isolate the information that\nwas available to the investigators at the investigative threshold.\nIn fact, we lack any distinct evidentiary record underpinning\nthe 2009 titling, indexing, or founding decisions; this appeal\ncame to us on the record supporting the 2011 final Report of\nInvestigation. See Army CID, Report of Investigation - Final\n(Jan. 12, 2011) (J.A. 398-445).\n\n     Another unusual twist in this case is that the decision\nappears to be having an impermissible continuing effect on\nCode. As conceded by the Secretary and reflected in the\nrecord, the Army appears to be relying exclusively on the\nchallenged titling decision to seek to collect from him the value\nof the education that it asserts Code obtained for his children\nunder false pretenses. Ordinarily, a titling decision is\nsuperseded and largely mooted by a finding of probable cause.\nReporting an offense as \u201cfounded\u201d reflects that investigation\nhas \u201cadequately substantiated\u201d the charge, giving law\nenforcement \u201cprobable cause supported by corroborating\nevidence\u201d to believe the crime was committed. If the\ninvestigation yields a determination of no probable cause to\n\f                               19\nbelieve that a crime was committed, the offense is reported as\n\u201cunfounded.\u201d See Army Regulation 190-45, \u00b6 4-3(a); id.\nGlossary \u00a7 II (defining \u201cFounded offense\u201d and \u201cUnfounded\noffense\u201d). Titling and indexing, on the other hand, \u201care\nadministrative procedures and shall not connote any degree of\nguilt or innocence.\u201d DoDI 5505.7 \u00b6 6.5. Department of\nDefense policy therefore confines the use of titling and\nindexing to \u201claw enforcement or security purposes\u201d and forbids\n\u201c[j]udicial or adverse administrative actions . . . against\nindividuals or entities based solely on the fact that they have\nbeen titled or indexed due to a criminal investigation.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 6.2, 6.5.2.\n\n      Notwithstanding the prohibition against sole reliance on a\ntitling decision as grounds for \u201cadverse administrative actions,\u201d\ncounsel for the Secretary asserts that the Defense Finance and\nAccounting Service may continue to seek to collect from Code\nthe cost of his three children\u2019s year of schooling at Fort\nBuchanan based on the titling decision alone. See Oral Arg.\nRec. 36:55-37:37 (counsel for the Secretary stating that \u201c[t]he\ntitling decision would still be adequate\u201d to support the\nDepartment\u2019s claim of entitlement to recoup tuition costs from\nCode), 38:36-57; see also Def. Fin. & Accounting Serv.,\nAdvisory Opinion: Department of Defense Education Activity\n(DoDEA) Debt Situation Involving Navy Lt Code, at 3 (Oct.\n13, 2016) (J.A. 213) (\u201cThe fact that [Code] was not charged\nwith a crime does not negate this debt to the US\nGovernment.\u201d). The record suggests that the Department of\nDefense does indeed plan to continue to seek to collect in\nexcess of $40,000 from Code based on the mere suspicion that\nhe obtained those services by fraud. The Defense Finance and\nAccounting Service notified Code of the putative tuition debt\nonly because the Army CID forwarded to the Accounting\nService the Report of Investigation reflecting both the titling\nand probable cause determinations. See ABCMR, Record of\n\f                                20\nProceedings \u00b6 6 (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 112). The Accounting\nService did not distinguish between titling and probable cause\nwhen it insisted that it would not cancel the debt or cease efforts\nto recoup it unless the Army CID \u201coverturned\u201d its prior\ndetermination. Letter from Bridgette Chrisman, Customer\nCare Representative, Def. Fin. & Accounting Serv., to\nChristopher J. Code (Apr. 20, 2012) (J.A. 201); see also Def.\nFin. & Accounting Serv., Advisory Opinion: Department of\nDefense Education Activity (DoDEA) Debt Situation\nInvolving Navy Lt Code, at 1 (Oct. 13, 2016) (J.A. 211); Email\nfrom Leonard Cooley, Def. Fin. & Accounting Serv., to Maria\nSanchez, Army Review Bds. Agency (May 3, 2016, 12:21\nEDT) (J.A. 244); but see Memorandum from the Army CID to\nDirector, Army Review Bds. Agency, at 1 (May 26, 2016) (J.A.\n313) (stating that the Defense Finance and Accounting Service,\n\u201cnot CID, is the determining body responsible for recouping\nfunds\u201d).\n\n     2. Because of the evident continuing harm to Code from\nthe Board\u2019s refusal to correct the record titling and indexing\nhim for crimes of making a false official statement and\nprocuring services under false pretenses, we review those\ndecisions and hold that they were arbitrary and capricious. The\nrecord of titling and indexing presented to the Board and\nreviewed by the district court did not credibly suggest that\nCode falsified the Fort Buchanan school enrollment form, nor\nthat he did so as a ruse to get his children school access they\ndid not deserve. We therefore cannot agree with the district\ncourt that the Board \u201cprovided a reasoned explanation of its\ndecision that is rationally related to the evidence before it\u201d\nwhen it held that credible information supported the Army\nCID\u2019s titling and indexing determinations that Code knowingly\nsubmitted a false enrollment form, thereby committing crimes\nof fraud and obtaining services by false pretenses. Code, 285\nF. Supp. 3d at 68.\n\f                              21\n     The record submitted in support of titling and indexing\nreflects the Army CID\u2019s determination that Code fraudulently\n\u201ccertified his date of departure\u201d as July 2008 on the enrollment\nform, and that it rested those threshold determinations on\ninterviews and \u201cexamination of records and military orders\u201d\nshowing that Code \u201cwas assigned\u201d to his post at the Fort\nBuchanan Military Entrance and Processing Station (MEPS)\non August 3, 2005, and \u201cthe tour at MEPS was twenty-four\nmonths.\u201d Army CID, Report of Investigation - 3rd Status, at\n3-4 (July 30, 2009) (J.A. 226-27). Investigators purported to\nhave determined that, \u201c[a]t the time Lt. Code signed the\nDoDEA Form 600 on 30 Apr 07, he knew that his P[ermanent]\nC[hange of] S[tation] was in June 07, and as such his dependent\nchildren were not eligible for attendance at the DOD school on\n[Fort] Buchanan.\u201d Id. at 4 (J.A. 227). The Army CID\u2019s final\nreport likewise announced that \u201cCode falsified documentation\nby registering his three children in the DDESS for a year while\nhe was not assigned to the geographic area,\u201d basing its\ninference of fraudulent intent on its conclusion that Code did\nso \u201c4 days after his Permanent Change of Station (PCS)[]\nextension request was denied, transferring him from Puerto\nRico to Kingsville, TX.\u201d Army CID, Report of Investigation -\nFinal, at 2 (Jan. 12, 2011) (J.A. 399).\n\n     The Army CID\u2019s investigators made a simple but\nconsequential mistake at the outset and then compounded their\nerror when they should have corrected course. It is apparently\nnot unusual for a tour of duty at the Military Entrance and\nProcessing Station to last only two years. The Army CID\u2019s\nfirst error was to accept\u2014apparently without checking the\nrecords\u2014the statement of the First Sergeant at the Military\nEntrance and Processing Station that Code\u2019s 2005 assignment\nto Fort Buchanan was due to expire in the summer of 2007. See\nFla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army CID, Agent\u2019s Investigation\nReport (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 405). Accepting the First\n\f                                 22\nSergeant\u2019s accusation, the Army CID concluded that Code was\nseeking at the tail end of his assignment to enroll his children\nin the Fort Buchanan School for an additional year\u2014a year\nduring which he already knew (according to the Army CID) he\nwould no longer be assigned to Fort Buchanan. Second, failing\nto discern that, even without extension, Code\u2019s then-current\norders lasted until July 2008, not July 2007, the Army CID\njumped to further erroneous conclusions: that Code already\nknew when he submitted the school enrollment form that his\nrequest for extension had been denied, and that he also knew,\neven before his reassignment to Texas, that he would have to\nleave Fort Buchanan in 2007.\n\n      At the time of their initial titling and indexing decision, the\nArmy CID investigators presumably had it within their power\nto verify the premise of their fraud theory. The record of the\ntitling and indexing decisions includes Code\u2019s official orders.\nIt is uncontested that Code\u2019s orders assigned him to Fort\nBuchanan from 2005 to 2008.                    The Secretary now\nacknowledges that official records authoritatively contradict\nany information that might have led the Army CID to think that\nCode\u2019s assignment to Puerto Rico was for only 24 months. See\nOral Arg. Rec. 16:10-38. Code never denied that the\nassignment was subject to change. But the Secretary also does\nnot contest that Code\u2019s superiors supported his application to\nserve out\u2014and even slightly extend\u2014his assignment at Fort\nBuchanan through August 2008, giving Code grounds for\noptimism that he might stay. In any event, it is clear and\nundisputed that no changed orders had yet issued when Code\nfilled out the school\u2019s application form in April 2007.\nTherefore, the only factually accurate way for Code to fill out\nthe form when he did was to write \u201cJuly 2008\u201d in the blank\nwhere the form states \u201cMy current orders will expire on\n_______.\u201d         Suppl. DoDEA Form 600 \u2013 School Year\n2007-2008 (Apr. 30, 2007) (J.A. 223). Code\u2019s request for\n\f                               23\ncorrection of the titling decision is therefore \u201csupported by\nuncontested, creditable evidence,\u201d and the Board\u2019s decision\notherwise \u201cdefies reason and is devoid of any evidentiary\nsupport.\u201d Haselwander, 774 F.3d at 992-93.\n\n     Code has consistently acknowledged that, at the time he\nsigned the application, he had heard that his orders were likely\nto be changed. Indeed, by Code\u2019s uncontradicted account, the\nfamily informed the school\u2019s Registrar in April that Code\nanticipated early reassignment elsewhere, and, after his\nPermanent Change of Station order came through in late May,\nCode contacted the Registrar again to verify the children\u2019s\neligibility. See Code Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9 (J.A. 456). The Registrar\nassured him, Code attested, that the children could stay at the\nFort Buchanan school, because \u201celigibility was based on my\nOrders at the time of enrollment.\u201d Suppl. Code. Decl. \u00b6 2 (J.A.\n497). The way the application form is worded is not to the\ncontrary.\n\n     The Board did not deem Code\u2019s account unworthy of\nbelief for any reason, but rejected it for want of corroboration,\n\u201csuch as a statement from the Registrar,\u201d which, the Board\nopined, \u201cwould appear to be easily obtained.\u201d ABCMR,\nRecord of Proceedings \u00b6 4 (Aug. 12, 2014) (J.A. 364). But it\nis not at all apparent how Code could have obtained such a\nstatement. Tellingly, the Army CID\u2019s own interview of the\nRegistrar\u2014at which the investigator in 2008 hypothetically\nposed to her the \u201csituation\u201d involving Code\u2019s children\u2014failed\nto contradict Code\u2019s account of his actual conversation with her\nin 2007.

If she had told\nCode that children are ineligible once their parent is reassigned\nelsewhere, or if the Codes had in fact never asked her about\ntheir children\u2019s eligibility, one would expect the Registrar to\nhave said so. The omission from the Army CID\u2019s interview\n\f                               24\nreport of any statement on the Registrar\u2019s part regarding her\nactual communications\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with the Code\nfamily tends to corroborate Code\u2019s declaration.\n\nC. The Alternative, Failure-to-Disenroll Theory\n\n     The Secretary has fleetingly suggested that the charged\noffense of obtaining services under false pretenses is separately\nsupported by Code\u2019s action in keeping the children enrolled in\nschool at Fort Buchanan after his Permanent Change of Station\norders sent him to Texas. Oral Arg. Rec. 30:05-31:06; see also\nABCMR, Record of Proceedings \u00b6 19 (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A.\n141). But the only falsehood or fraud the Army CID identified\nwas that Code submitted a school application for the 2007-\n2008 school year listing July 2008 as the date his assignment\nto Fort Buchanan was due to expire. The Board itself described\nthe sole issue before it as whether to expunge records of the\nCID investigators\u2019 determination that \u201cthere was credible\nevidence to believe [Code] fraudulently obtained education\nservices from the government and did so by means of a false\nofficial statement.\u201d ABCMR, Record of Proceedings \u00b6 28\n(Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 144). We cannot sustain the Board\u2019s\ndecision on a different ground, neither charged nor litigated in\nthis case.\n\n     As explained above, the sole falsehood anywhere in the\nrecord of the Army CID\u2019s investigation was the statement Code\nmade on the school application form on April 30, 2007, that his\n\u201ccurrent orders\u201d expired on \u201cJuly 2008.\u201d In its interim and\nfinal titling decisions, the CID found that Code \u201cfalsely listed\nhis [order expiry date] of July 2008,\u201d Army CID, Report of\nInvestigation - 3rd Status, at 2 (July 30, 2009) (J.A. 225), and\nconcluded that there was \u201cprobable cause to believe Lt. Code\ncommitted the offense of False Official Statement and Larceny\nwhen he falsified documentation by registering his three\n\f                               25\nchildren in the DDESS for a year while he was not assigned to\nthe geographic area,\u201d Army CID, Report of Investigation -\nFinal, at 2 (Jan. 12, 2011) (J.A. 399).\n\n      Even if the Army had made, the Board upheld, and\nbriefing preserved a charge of fraudulent failure to disenroll, a\ntitling and indexing decision made on that theory must fail\nbecause it is unsupported by any credible information that\nCode acted with fraudulent intent when he persisted in sending\nhis children to the Fort Buchanan school. This alternative\ntheory assumes that the application itself was not fraudulent\nand that the children were permissibly re-registered at the Fort\nBuchanan school, but that Code knew that his children became\nineligible once his new Permanent Change of Station orders\ncame through yet failed at that time to withdraw them from the\nschool.\n\n     Because state of mind is what differentiates mere error\nfrom criminal fraud, a charge of fraudulent failure to withdraw\ncould not be made without credible information that the suspect\nacted with fraudulent intent. See generally United States v.\nProject on Gov\u2019t Oversight, 616 F.3d 544, 552 & n.9 (D.C. Cir.\n2010) (collecting cases). But the Army CID never identified\nany credible information on which to conclude that Code knew\nthat his children lost their school eligibility simultaneously\nwith his change of orders, and hence that he knowingly violated\nan obligation to take them out of school. The Board only gets\npart of the way with its contention that Code\u2019s \u201cchange of\nstation orders taking him to Texas had the obvious effect of\nmaking him and his family ineligible for tuition-free education\nat the Fort Buchanan school.\u201d           ABCMR, Record of\nProceedings \u00b6 27 (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 144). We assume that\nthe Board is correct that, under Department of Defense policy,\nCode\u2019s reassignment rendered his children ineligible. But that\ndoes not mean Code knew they were ineligible. And, contrary\n\f                                26\nto the Board\u2019s characterization, the eligibility rules for children\nof a servicemember who moves are far from \u201cobvious.\u201d Id.\n\n    Department of Defense law and rules tying eligibility to\nwhere the servicemember is stationed include an exception\nallowing \u201ccurrently enrolled students\u201d to remain throughout a\nschool year, even after their parent-sponsor has been assigned\nelsewhere. The statute states that\n\n      [t]he Secretary of Defense shall permit a dependent\n      of a member of the armed forces . . . to continue\n      enrollment in an educational program provided by\n      the Secretary . . . for the remainder of a school year\n      notwithstanding a change during such school year\n      in the status of the member . . . that, except for this\n      paragraph, would otherwise terminate the eligibility\n      of the dependent to be enrolled in the program.\n\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2164(h)(1). In similar terms, the implementing\nrule provides that, \u201c[i]f the status of the sponsor of a currently\nenrolled student changes so that the child would no longer be\neligible for enrollment,\u201d the student\u2019s enrollment nonetheless\n\u201cmay continue for the remainder of the school year.\u201d DoDI\n1342.26 \u00b6 6.3.7.\n\n      The record contains no credible information that Code\nknew no such exception applied to his children. Indeed, Code\u2019s\nunrebutted declaration attests to the contrary: When Code\ninformed the Fort Buchanan school Registrar that he had been\nreassigned to Texas, she assured him that the children could\ncomplete the year at the Fort Buchanan school because they\nhad validly enrolled based on his prior assignment. See Suppl.\nCode Decl. \u00b6 2 (J.A. 497). Even if that view misapprehends\nthe relevant rule, as the Secretary now argues and we assume,\nit is entirely plausible that the Registrar so understood it when\nshe spoke to Code.\n\f                               27\n     Indeed, the plausibility of Code\u2019s account of his\nunderstanding based on his exchange with the Registrar gains\npowerful support from the Army\u2019s own inconsistent usage of\nthe term \u201cenrolled.\u201d The Secretary now argues that children\nare only \u201cenrolled\u201d within the meaning of the currently-\nenrolled-student exception once classes are underway in the\ncorresponding school year, whereas Code was reassigned\nduring the summer before school had resumed for the fall term,\nmaking his children ineligible to \u201ccontinue enrollment\u201d under\nthe exception. Appellee\u2019s Br. 42; see Oral Arg. Rec. 31:07-35.\nThe Registrar\u2019s post-hoc response to the hypothetical posed by\nthe Army CID also narrowly construed enrollment to refer only\nto attendance while \u201cthe school year was in progress\n(Sep[tember] through May).\u201d Fla. Fraud Resident Agency,\nArmy CID, Agent\u2019s Investigation Report (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A.\n404). But the Board and counsel for the Secretary on this\nappeal themselves all repeatedly used the term \u201cenrollment\u201d to\nrefer to registration, without regard to whether classes were yet\nunderway. See, e.g., Memorandum from the Army CID to\nDirector, U.S. Army Crime Records Ctr. (Apr. 4, 2013)\n(J.A. 383) (\u201cCode committed the offenses [of] False Official\nStatement and Larceny when he enrolled his children prior to\nthe start of the 2007-2008 school year . . . .\u201d); ABCMR, Record\nof Proceedings \u00b6\u00b6 19, 27 (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 141) (noting that\nCode \u201cis accused of fraudulently enrolling his children into the\nFort Buchanan school\u201d); Appellee\u2019s Br. 9, 11; Oral Arg. Rec.\n30:48-54 (\u201cThey had only been enrolled. So they hadn\u2019t\nactually started school.\u201d) (all emphases added). The Board\u2019s\nand government counsel\u2019s equation of registration and\nenrollment is inconsistent with the Department of Defense\u2019s\nreading of its own rule, but it reinforces the plausibility of\nCode\u2019s understanding, avowedly on the Registrar\u2019s advice, that\ndespite his reassignment his children were \u201cenrolled\u201d and so\neligible to remain at the Fort Buchanan School under the\nexception for currently enrolled students.\n\f                               28\n     Ultimately, the Secretary\u2019s case for fraudulent failure-to-\ndisenroll rests on the \u201cpresumption of administrative\nregularity\u201d the ABCMR accords official actions. 32 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 581.3(e)(2); see Appellee\u2019s Br. 43-44 (citing Roberts v.\nUnited States, 741 F.3d 152, 158 (D.C. Cir. 2014)). The\nSecretary contends that a presumption that government\npersonnel \u201cproperly discharge[] their official duties\u201d\nestablishes that, had Code or his wife called the Registrar, she\nnecessarily would have informed them of their children\u2019s\nineligibility. Roberts, 741 F.3d at 158 (quoting 32 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 723.3(e)(2)); Army Board for Correction of Military\nRecords, Record of Proceedings (Aug. 12, 2014) (J.A. 365).\nThe Secretary reasons that Code\u2019s affidavits cannot overcome\nsuch a presumption without \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d\u2014in\nparticular, a signed statement from the Registrar affirming\nCode\u2019s own declarations that she told him his children could\nremain at the school through the 2007-2008 school year.\nAppellee\u2019s Br. 43; see also ABCMR, Record of Proceedings\n\u00b6\u00b6 4, 8 (Aug. 12, 2014) (J.A. 364-65). To the contrary, once\nCode identified the absence of evidence supporting the Army\nCID\u2019s actions, it was not his obligation to disprove fraudulent\nintent. Rather, the issue was that the Army investigators had\nnever met their burden to show it\u2014first with \u201ccredible\ninformation\u201d for titling and indexing, and then with probable\ncause to deem the charge \u201cfounded.\u201d Neither the Army CID,\nthe Board, nor counsel for the Secretary have pointed to any\nevidence that Code intended to defraud the government\u2014\nwhether when he submitted the enrollment form accurately\nstating the expiration date of his current orders, or when, after\nhis orders changed, his children continued to attend the Fort\nBuchanan school where they were enrolled. We reject the\nextraordinary position that a background presumption of\nregularity can alone prove criminal intent to defraud, and that\na suspect\u2019s statement to the contrary under oath cannot rebut\nsuch \u201cproof\u201d unless independently corroborated by the very\n\f                              29\nofficial benefiting from the presumption\u2014especially where, as\nhere, the administrative process does not appear to provide for\nany opportunity to question or obtain a statement from the\nofficial under oath. See 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 581.3(c)(2)(iii), (f).\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n\n     We reverse the judgment of the district court, vacate the\ndecision of the Army Board for the Correction of Military\nRecords, and remand the case to the district court with\ninstructions to remand to the Board for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   So ordered.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued January 30, 2020                 Decided May 26, 2020\n\n                         No. 18-5122\n\n                    CHRISTOPHER J.

Martens Jr.,\nSpecial Assistant U.S. Attorney, entered an appearance.\n\n    Before: TATEL, PILLARD, and WILKINS, Circuit Judges.\n\n    Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge PILLARD.\n\n     PILLARD , Circuit Judge: Lieutenant Christopher Code\nasked the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records\n(the Board or ABCMR) to expunge or amend Army\ninvestigators\u2019 determinations recorded in his military files.\nThe records at issue stated that credible information and\nprobable cause existed to believe that Code committed the\ncriminal offenses of making a false official statement with\nintent to deceive and obtaining services under false pretenses.\nThe allegedly false statement was the expiration date of Code\u2019s\ncurrent military orders, which he wrote in a blank on the 2007-\n2008 school year registration form to re-enroll his three\nchildren at the Fort Buchanan base school that they had\nattended since 2005. The Secretary of the Army claims Code\u2019s\nprovision of that date was a false pretense that he used to obtain\nan additional year of schooling for his children when, the Army\nalleges, Code knew they were not entitled to that service.\n\n     When Code filled out the school form on April 30, 2007,\nhe was under orders assigning him to Fort Buchanan for three\nyears, from July 2005 to July 2008. Where the school\nregistration form stated \u201cI am active duty and my current orders\nwill expire on _____,\u201d Code filled in \u201cJuly 2008.\u201d Army\ninvestigators apparently at first believed Code\u2019s assignment\nwas for two years, not three; they opened a fraud investigation\non that premise. It is by now undisputed, however, that the\nassignment was for three years. The investigation did not lead\nto any criminal prosecution or military discipline. Yet, when\nCode sought to have the allegations and charges removed from\n\f                                3\nhis military records, the Board denied his application and the\ndistrict court sustained its decision. Because a basic mistake of\nfact renders the Board\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious, we\nreverse.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\n\nA.

During that tour of duty, Code and his family lived in\noff-base housing and his three children attended the\nDepartment of Defense school at the Fort Buchanan base.\n\n     Sometime between January and March of 2007, Code\nlearned that he was likely to receive new \u201cpermanent change of\nstation\u201d orders assigning him somewhere else before his\ncurrent orders assigning him to Puerto Rico expired in July\n2008. Fla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army CID, Agent\u2019s\nInvestigation Report (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 405); Code Decl. \u00b6 6\n(J.A. 455). Because his elderly father had only recently moved\nto live with Code\u2019s family in Puerto Rico, Code\u2019s preference\n\f                               7\nwas to remain at Fort Buchanan for the full three years if\npossible. With the support of his superiors, Code applied on\nMarch 12, 2007, for a one-month extension of his then-current\norders which, if granted, would keep him at Fort Buchanan\nthrough August 2008.\n\n     In a letter dated Thursday, April 26, 2007, the Navy\u2019s\ndepartment of human resources denied the extension request,\ndescribing it as a request for a \u201cthirteen-month extension.\u201d\nLetter from Head, Human Res. Cmty., to Lt. Christopher Code\n(Apr. 26, 2007) (J.A. 430). Code asserts, and the Secretary\ndoes not dispute, that he did not receive the denial letter until\nTuesday, May 8, 2007, as evidenced by a faxed copy of the\nletter with a heading showing the date of May 8, 2007.\n\n     Meanwhile, Code\u2019s three children were attending the Fort\nBuchanan school, where they had been enrolled since Code\u2019s\ntour in Puerto Rico began in 2005. Registration for the\nupcoming school year was in progress. See Oral Arg. Rec.\n22:13-37; see also DoDI 1342.26 \u00b6 6.3.4.3 (referencing May\nenrollment deadline). On Monday, April 30, 2007, Code\nsubmitted an application to reenroll the children for the 2007-\n2008 school year. Where the enrollment form stated: \u201cI am\nactive duty and my current orders will expire on _____,\u201d Code\nfilled in \u201cJuly 2008,\u201d as he presumably had done each of the\nprior two years.

But school enrollment forms were due, and there is no\ncontention that the Code family was rushing to submit theirs\nearly. See Oral Arg. Rec. 22:13-37. As of April\u2014the same\ntime of year the Code family had applied the prior year\u2014the\nschool was urging parents of currently enrolled children to\nsubmit any 2007 reenrollment forms. Code\u2019s wife told the\nschool\u2019s Registrar of the possibility that Code would receive\nearly change orders, in advance of his current orders\u2019 July 2008\nexpiration date. Code attests that the Registrar \u201cadvised my\nwife that my children\u2019s eligibility to attend the [Fort] Buchanan\nschool for the 2007-2008 term was tied to my current orders,\nwhich at that point still had me stationed in San Juan through\nJuly 2008.\u201d Code Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A. 456).\n\n     On May 23, 2007, Code received change-of-station orders\ndirecting him to report for duty in Kingsville, Texas, in June\n2007. Code attests that, \u201c[i]mmediately upon receipt\u201d of his\nnew orders, he notified the Registrar, who assured him that the\nchildren could stay at the Fort Buchanan school, because\n\u201celigibility was based on my Orders at the time of enrollment.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n<span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> \u00b6 9; </span><pre class=\"inline\">Suppl. Code Decl. \u00b6 2 (J.A. 497). Pursuant to his\norders, Code reported to Kingsville in June 2007. His wife and\nchildren, together with Code\u2019s father, remained in Puerto Rico\nfor the time being, and the children attended the Fort Buchanan\nschool during the 2007-2008 school year.\n\n     In November 2007, base police in Puerto Rico became\naware that the Code children were attending the Fort Buchanan\nschool while Code was stationed elsewhere. In January 2008,\nthe Florida Fraud Resident Agency of the U.S. Army Criminal\nInvestigation Command (known as the \u201cCID\u201d because it was\nformerly called the Criminal Investigation Division) opened an\ninvestigation into whether Code\u2019s children were fraudulently\n\f                                 9\nenrolled in the Fort Buchanan school. The Army CID first\ninterviewed an unnamed First Sergeant at the Military Entrance\nand Processing Station at Fort Buchanan. The First Sergeant\nerroneously informed the CID that the orders assigning Code\nto Fort Buchanan, which were in effect when Code completed\nthe school enrollment form, expired \u201csometime during the\nsummer months\u201d of 2007. Fla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army\nCID, Agent\u2019s Investigation Report (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 405).\nAs noted above, it is undisputed that Code\u2019s current orders at\nthe time he submitted the form assigned him to Fort Buchanan\nuntil July 2008.\n\n     Without yet having contacted Code, the Army CID\ninterviewed the Fort Buchanan school Registrar on January 25,\n2008. There is no record whether the investigator asked about\nthe Registrar\u2019s actual conversations with Code or his wife. The\ninterview report reflects only that the Army CID presented to\nthe Registrar hypothetically \u201cthe scenario involving Lt. Code.\u201d\nFla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army CID, Agent\u2019s Investigation\nReport (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 404). The Registrar responded\nwith her then-current understanding that (in retrospect) she\nbelieved Code\u2019s children would have been ineligible to register\nfor or attend the school \u201csince the sponsor, Lt.

The Army CID wished to know \u201cthe date Lt.

The officer responded:\n\n    If you are trying to prove that he intentionally\n    defrauded the local school by saying he thought his\n    extension was approved, I can affirm with absolute\n    confidence that I personally told him otherwise\n    within no more than a few days after the date on\n    letter, and certainly we issued him transfer orders,\n    which presumably he executed, which once again\n    would indicate that he knew he was no longer\n    eligible to use the school.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n\n<span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (J.A. 441-42).\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n     At some point during the investigation, the Army CID\nobtained a copy of Code\u2019s orders assigning him to Fort\nBuchanan in July 2005. Those orders, as confirmed by Code\u2019s\ncommanding officer when he signed in for duty, authoritatively\nestablished that Code was assigned to Fort Buchanan from July\n25, 2005, until July 25, 2008.

The\nSecretary\u2019s own brief tells us that Code\u2019s \u201ctour of duty in\nPuerto Rico was to be from August 2005 until July 2008\u201d and\nthat Navy personnel advised Code he would receive new\nchange of station orders before his \u201ccurrent orders expired in\nJuly 2008.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 10 (quoting J.A. 471).

Agency, at 2 (May 26,\n2016) (J.A. 314). The Army CID stressed that this was \u201cre-\niterated\u201d by the CID at its February 2008 interview with Code.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n<span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\n    The children </span><pre class=\"inline\">openly attended the Fort Buchanan school\nthroughout the 2007-2008 school year. The school is run by\nthe Department of Defense, which manages its enrollment\naccording to priorities established by Department of Defense\n\f                               12\nregulation. See DoDI 1342.26 \u00b6 6.2.2. The February 2008\ninterview was the first that Code learned about any potential\nproblem with his children\u2019s enrollment. See Code Decl. \u00b6 10\n(J.A. 456). There is no evidence that the school at any point\u2014\neither before or after the CID\u2019s February 2008 interview with\nCode\u2014asked the family to remove the children from the school\nor otherwise took steps to exclude them.\n\n     In its earliest report in the record, the Army CID stated on\nJuly 30, 2009, that it had what it believed was both \u201ccredible\ninformation\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that Code made\na false statement on April 30, 2007, when he submitted the\napplication form to the Fort Buchanan school for his three\nchildren for the 2007-2008 school year. Based on Domestic\nDependent Elementary and Secondary School (DDESS)-\nPuerto Rico tuition rates, the Army CID calculated that the\n\u201cmonetary loss to the U.S. Government [was] $44,200.\u201d Army\nCID, Report of Investigation - 3rd Status, at 2 (July 30, 2009)\n(J.A. 227). The investigators referred the putative debt to the\nDefense Finance and Accounting Service for collection. On\nSeptember 30, 2010, the Accounting Service initiated debt\ncollection against Code.\n\n    The Army CID concluded its investigation on January 12,\n2011, issuing a final report that determined there was\n\n    [p]robable cause to believe Lt. Code committed the\n    offense of False Official Statement and Larceny\n    when he falsified documentation by registering his\n    three children in the DDESS for a year while he was\n    not assigned to the geographic area. Lt. Code\n    knowingly falsified these DDESS documents 4 days\n    after his Permanent Change of Station (PCS),\n    extension request was denied, transferring him from\n    Puerto Rico to Kingsville, TX.\n\f                               13\nArmy CID, Report of Investigation - Final, at 2 (Jan. 12, 2011)\n(J.A. 398-99). The Army CID noted that it had referred the\ncase to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in San Juan but that the U.S.\nAttorney had declined to prosecute, leaving to the Department\nof Defense and Code\u2019s chain of command whether to take any\naction against him. Defense Department personnel declined to\ntake any prosecutorial or disciplinary action.\n\nC. Procedural History\n\n     Code applied first to the Army CID itself, then to the Army\nBoard for Correction of Military Records, for expungement or\ncorrection of the Report of Investigation\u2014that is, to vacate the\nCID\u2019s titling and probable-cause determinations. Code\nexplained that he could not have made a false official statement\nbecause the registration form asked specifically and\nexclusively for the date of expiration of his \u201ccurrent orders,\u201d\nwhich, when he signed the registration form, he accurately\nstated were set to expire in July 2008.\n\n     The Army CID and Board nonetheless denied relief, and\nCode timely sought review in district court. The district court\nidentified several inadequacies in the Board\u2019s decision,\nincluding the Board\u2019s application of the wrong regulation to\ndetermine the eligibility of Code\u2019s children and its failure to\naddress Code\u2019s challenge to the Army CID\u2019s referral of the\ninvestigative report to the Defense Finance and Accounting\nService to initiate collection. Over Code\u2019s objection, the\ndistrict court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for voluntary\nremand to allow the Board to \u201caddress the inadequacies\u201d raised\nby Code\u2019s complaint.

The\nBoard denied any relief in Code\u2019s favor, instead taking the\n\f                               14\noccasion to recommend that the Army CID amend the Report\nof Investigation to substitute a charge of obtaining services\nunder false pretenses for the inapposite larceny charge. See\nABCMR, Record of Proceedings (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 110).\nThe Board determined that, while the behavior the CID\nascribed to Code did not amount to larceny, Code could instead\nbe re-titled with, and have founded against him, an offense of\nobtaining     services under false pretenses, which\n\u201ccontemplate[s] the wrongful obtaining of services rather than\ntangible property.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> \u00b6 19 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(J.A. 141).\n\n     Code returned to the district court to pursue his claim that\nthe Board\u2019s denial of relief from the titling and probable-cause\ndeterminations was arbitrary and capricious.

In view of that constraint,\nit is not clear that the Board acted within the scope of its\nauthority when it suggested that Code could be re-titled with a\nnew offense. But because Code does not press that argument,\nsee Oral Arg. Rec. 10:42-58, and prevails on other grounds, we\ndo not resolve it now.\n\nA. Probable Cause\n\n     The Secretary has forfeited any defense of the Army CID\u2019s\nprobable-cause determination. In neither its initial review nor\nits review on remand from the district court did the Board\nseparately address Code\u2019s contentions that the CID lacked\nprobable cause to conclude that he had committed fraud.\nRather than account for the Board\u2019s omissions, counsel for the\nSecretary asserts that it was Code who failed to preserve his\nchallenge to probable cause on summary judgment in the\ndistrict court.

We reverse the district court\u2019s decision insofar as it\ndeclines to hold arbitrary and capricious the Board\u2019s failure to\nengage with Code\u2019s challenge to the probable-cause\ndetermination.\n\n    In any case, for essentially the same reasons explained\nbelow in connection with the titling and indexing decision, the\nBoard\u2019s determination of probable cause to believe that Code\ndefrauded the Department of Defense cannot stand.\n\nB. Titling and Indexing\n\n     We hold arbitrary and capricious the Board\u2019s decision\naffirming the Army CID\u2019s titling and indexing decision.\n\n     1. Review of a titling and indexing decision is unusual,\nbut it is called for here by several circumstances particular to\nthis case.\n\n      First, the case appears before us without a record that\nseparately identifies whatever initial, presumably limited, body\nof evidence the Army CID relied on to decide to title and index\nCode for criminal fraud. Applicable regulations suggest that\ntitling is akin to a threshold reason-to-believe or reasonable-\nsuspicion standard, typically made at the very outset of an\n\f                               18\ninvestigation. As Department of Defense rules explain,\n\u201c[t]itling and indexing . . . shall be done as early in the\ninvestigation as it is determined that credible information exists\nthat the subject committed a criminal offense.\u201d DoDI 5505.7\n\u00b6 6.1. The earliest determination in the record before us,\nhowever, is reflected in the July 30, 2009, Report of\nInvestigation, in which the titling and probable cause\ndeterminations are merged. That Report was \u201cgenerated to\ncorrect identifying on the subject [sic], change the offenses\nfrom U.S. Code to UCMJ, and list the offenses as founded.\u201d\nArmy CID, Report of Investigation - 3rd Status, at 2 (July 30,\n2009) (J.A. 225). We have no record of any threshold titling\nand indexing determination apart from and in advance of the\nReport that also found probable cause, nor has the Secretary\nexplained how we might otherwise isolate the information that\nwas available to the investigators at the investigative threshold.\nIn fact, we lack any distinct evidentiary record underpinning\nthe 2009 titling, indexing, or founding decisions; this appeal\ncame to us on the record supporting the 2011 final Report of\nInvestigation. See Army CID, Report of Investigation - Final\n(Jan. 12, 2011) (J.A. 398-445).\n\n     Another unusual twist in this case is that the decision\nappears to be having an impermissible continuing effect on\nCode. As conceded by the Secretary and reflected in the\nrecord, the Army appears to be relying exclusively on the\nchallenged titling decision to seek to collect from him the value\nof the education that it asserts Code obtained for his children\nunder false pretenses. Ordinarily, a titling decision is\nsuperseded and largely mooted by a finding of probable cause.\nReporting an offense as \u201cfounded\u201d reflects that investigation\nhas \u201cadequately substantiated\u201d the charge, giving law\nenforcement \u201cprobable cause supported by corroborating\nevidence\u201d to believe the crime was committed. If the\ninvestigation yields a determination of no probable cause to\n\f                               19\nbelieve that a crime was committed, the offense is reported as\n\u201cunfounded.\u201d See Army Regulation 190-45, \u00b6 4-3(a);</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498691\"><a href=\"/opinion/498691/barry-w-wolfe-v-john-o-marsh-jr-secretary-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span></span>\nGlossary \u00a7 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">II (defining \u201cFounded offense\u201d and \u201cUnfounded\noffense\u201d).

See Oral Arg.\nRec. 36:55-37:37 (counsel for the Secretary stating that \u201c[t]he\ntitling decision would still be adequate\u201d to support the\nDepartment\u2019s claim of entitlement to recoup tuition costs from\nCode), 38:36-57; see also Def. Fin. & Accounting Serv.,\nAdvisory Opinion: Department of Defense Education Activity\n(DoDEA) Debt Situation Involving Navy Lt Code, at 3 (Oct.\n13, 2016) (J.A. 213) (\u201cThe fact that [Code] was not charged\nwith a crime does not negate this debt to the US\nGovernment.\u201d). The record suggests that the Department of\nDefense does indeed plan to continue to seek to collect in\nexcess of $40,000 from Code based on the mere suspicion that\nhe obtained those services by fraud. The Defense Finance and\nAccounting Service notified Code of the putative tuition debt\nonly because the Army CID forwarded to the Accounting\nService the Report of Investigation reflecting both the titling\nand probable cause determinations. See ABCMR, Record of\n\f                                20\nProceedings \u00b6 6 (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 112). The Accounting\nService did not distinguish between titling and probable cause\nwhen it insisted that it would not cancel the debt or cease efforts\nto recoup it unless the Army CID \u201coverturned\u201d its prior\ndetermination.

Because of the evident continuing harm to Code from\nthe Board\u2019s refusal to correct the record titling and indexing\nhim for crimes of making a false official statement and\nprocuring services under false pretenses, we review those\ndecisions and hold that they were arbitrary and capricious. The\nrecord of titling and indexing presented to the Board and\nreviewed by the district court did not credibly suggest that\nCode falsified the Fort Buchanan school enrollment form, nor\nthat he did so as a ruse to get his children school access they\ndid not deserve. We therefore cannot agree with the district\ncourt that the Board \u201cprovided a reasoned explanation of its\ndecision that is rationally related to the evidence before it\u201d\nwhen it held that credible information supported the Army\nCID\u2019s titling and indexing determinations that Code knowingly\nsubmitted a false enrollment form, thereby committing crimes\nof fraud and obtaining services by false pretenses.

The Army CID\u2019s final\nreport likewise announced that \u201cCode falsified documentation\nby registering his three children in the DDESS for a year while\nhe was not assigned to the geographic area,\u201d basing its\ninference of fraudulent intent on its conclusion that Code did\nso \u201c4 days after his Permanent Change of Station (PCS)[]\nextension request was denied, transferring him from Puerto\nRico to Kingsville, TX.\u201d Army CID, Report of Investigation -\nFinal, at 2 (Jan. 12, 2011) (J.A. 399).\n\n     The Army CID\u2019s investigators made a simple but\nconsequential mistake at the outset and then compounded their\nerror when they should have corrected course. It is apparently\nnot unusual for a tour of duty at the Military Entrance and\nProcessing Station to last only two years. The Army CID\u2019s\nfirst error was to accept\u2014apparently without checking the\nrecords\u2014the statement of the First Sergeant at the Military\nEntrance and Processing Station that Code\u2019s 2005 assignment\nto Fort Buchanan was due to expire in the summer of 2007. See\nFla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army CID, Agent\u2019s Investigation\nReport (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 405). Accepting the First\n\f                                 22\nSergeant\u2019s accusation, the Army CID concluded that Code was\nseeking at the tail end of his assignment to enroll his children\nin the Fort Buchanan School for an additional year\u2014a year\nduring which he already knew (according to the Army CID) he\nwould no longer be assigned to Fort Buchanan. Second, failing\nto discern that, even without extension, Code\u2019s then-current\norders lasted until July 2008, not July 2007, the Army CID\njumped to further erroneous conclusions: that Code already\nknew when he submitted the school enrollment form that his\nrequest for extension had been denied, and that he also knew,\neven before his reassignment to Texas, that he would have to\nleave Fort Buchanan in 2007.\n\n      At the time of their initial titling and indexing decision, the\nArmy CID investigators presumably had it within their power\nto verify the premise of their fraud theory. The record of the\ntitling and indexing decisions includes Code\u2019s official orders.\nIt is uncontested that Code\u2019s orders assigned him to Fort\nBuchanan from 2005 to 2008.                    The Secretary now\nacknowledges that official records authoritatively contradict\nany information that might have led the Army CID to think that\nCode\u2019s assignment to Puerto Rico was for only 24 months. See\nOral Arg. Rec. 16:10-38. Code never denied that the\nassignment was subject to change. But the Secretary also does\nnot contest that Code\u2019s superiors supported his application to\nserve out\u2014and even slightly extend\u2014his assignment at Fort\nBuchanan through August 2008, giving Code grounds for\noptimism that he might stay. In any event, it is clear and\nundisputed that no changed orders had yet issued when Code\nfilled out the school\u2019s application form in April 2007.\nTherefore, the only factually accurate way for Code to fill out\nthe form when he did was to write \u201cJuly 2008\u201d in the blank\nwhere the form states \u201cMy current orders will expire on\n_______.\u201d         Suppl. DoDEA Form 600 \u2013 School Year\n2007-2008 (Apr. 30, 2007) (J.A. 223). Code\u2019s request for\n\f                               23\ncorrection of the titling decision is therefore \u201csupported by\nuncontested, creditable evidence,\u201d and the Board\u2019s decision\notherwise \u201cdefies reason and is devoid of any evidentiary\nsupport.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Haselwander,</span> <span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">992-93</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     Code has consistently acknowledged that, at the time he\nsigned the application, he had heard that his orders were likely\nto be changed. Indeed, by Code\u2019s uncontradicted account, the\nfamily informed the school\u2019s Registrar in April that Code\nanticipated early reassignment elsewhere, and, after his\nPermanent Change of Station order came through in late May,\nCode contacted the Registrar again to verify the children\u2019s\neligibility. See Code Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9 (J.A. 456). The Registrar\nassured him, Code attested, that the children could stay at the\nFort Buchanan school, because \u201celigibility was based on my\nOrders at the time of enrollment.\u201d Suppl. Code. Decl. \u00b6 2 (J.A.\n497). The way the application form is worded is not to the\ncontrary.\n\n     The Board did not deem Code\u2019s account unworthy of\nbelief for any reason, but rejected it for want of corroboration,\n\u201csuch as a statement from the Registrar,\u201d which, the Board\nopined, \u201cwould appear to be easily obtained.\u201d ABCMR,\nRecord of Proceedings \u00b6 4 (Aug. 12, 2014) (J.A. 364). But it\nis not at all apparent how Code could have obtained such a\nstatement. Tellingly, the Army CID\u2019s own interview of the\nRegistrar\u2014at which the investigator in 2008 hypothetically\nposed to her the \u201csituation\u201d involving Code\u2019s children\u2014failed\nto contradict Code\u2019s account of his actual conversation with her\nin 2007. Fla. Fraud Resident Agency, Army CID, Agent\u2019s\nInvestigation Report (Jan. 25, 2008) (J.A. 404). If she had told\nCode that children are ineligible once their parent is reassigned\nelsewhere, or if the Codes had in fact never asked her about\ntheir children\u2019s eligibility, one would expect the Registrar to\nhave said so. The omission from the Army CID\u2019s interview\n\f                               24\nreport of any statement on the Registrar\u2019s part regarding her\nactual communications\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with the Code\nfamily tends to corroborate Code\u2019s declaration.\n\nC. The Alternative, Failure-to-Disenroll Theory\n\n     The Secretary has fleetingly suggested that the charged\noffense of obtaining services under false pretenses is separately\nsupported by Code\u2019s action in keeping the children enrolled in\nschool at Fort Buchanan after his Permanent Change of Station\norders sent him to Texas. Oral Arg. Rec. 30:05-31:06; see also\nABCMR, Record of Proceedings \u00b6 19 (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A.\n141). But the only falsehood or fraud the Army CID identified\nwas that Code submitted a school application for the 2007-\n2008 school year listing July 2008 as the date his assignment\nto Fort Buchanan was due to expire. The Board itself described\nthe sole issue before it as whether to expunge records of the\nCID investigators\u2019 determination that \u201cthere was credible\nevidence to believe [Code] fraudulently obtained education\nservices from the government and did so by means of a false\nofficial statement.\u201d ABCMR, Record of Proceedings \u00b6 28\n(Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 144). We cannot sustain the Board\u2019s\ndecision on a different ground, neither charged nor litigated in\nthis case.\n\n     As explained above, the sole falsehood anywhere in the\nrecord of the Army CID\u2019s investigation was the statement Code\nmade on the school application form on April 30, 2007, that his\n\u201ccurrent orders\u201d expired on \u201cJuly 2008.\u201d In its interim and\nfinal titling decisions, the CID found that Code \u201cfalsely listed\nhis [order expiry date] of July 2008,\u201d Army CID, Report of\nInvestigation - 3rd Status, at 2 (July 30, 2009) (J.A. 225), and\nconcluded that there was \u201cprobable cause to believe Lt. Code\ncommitted the offense of False Official Statement and Larceny\nwhen he falsified documentation by registering his three\n\f                               25\nchildren in the DDESS for a year while he was not assigned to\nthe geographic area,\u201d Army CID, Report of Investigation -\nFinal, at 2 (Jan. 12, 2011) (J.A. 399).\n\n      Even if the Army had made, the Board upheld, and\nbriefing preserved a charge of fraudulent failure to disenroll, a\ntitling and indexing decision made on that theory must fail\nbecause it is unsupported by any credible information that\nCode acted with fraudulent intent when he persisted in sending\nhis children to the Fort Buchanan school. This alternative\ntheory assumes that the application itself was not fraudulent\nand that the children were permissibly re-registered at the Fort\nBuchanan school, but that Code knew that his children became\nineligible once his new Permanent Change of Station orders\ncame through yet failed at that time to withdraw them from the\nschool.\n\n     Because state of mind is what differentiates mere error\nfrom criminal fraud, a charge of fraudulent failure to withdraw\ncould not be made without credible information that the suspect\nacted with fraudulent intent. See generally United States v.\nProject on Gov\u2019t Oversight, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"152168\"><a href=\"/opinion/152168/united-states-v-project-on-government-oversight/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 & n.9 (D.C. Cir.\n2010) (collecting cases). But the Army CID never identified\nany credible information on which to conclude that Code knew\nthat his children lost their school eligibility simultaneously\nwith his change of orders, and hence that he knowingly violated\nan obligation to take them out of school. The Board only gets\npart of the way with its contention that Code\u2019s \u201cchange of\nstation orders taking him to Texas had the obvious effect of\nmaking him and his family ineligible for tuition-free education\nat the Fort Buchanan school.\u201d           ABCMR, Record of\nProceedings \u00b6 27 (Jan. 31, 2017) (J.A. 144). We assume that\nthe Board is correct that, under Department of Defense policy,\nCode\u2019s reassignment rendered his children ineligible. But that\ndoes not mean Code knew they were ineligible. And, contrary\n\f                                26\nto the Board\u2019s characterization, the eligibility rules for children\nof a servicemember who moves are far from \u201cobvious.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"152168\"> <a href=\"/opinion/152168/united-states-v-project-on-government-oversight/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\n    Department of </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Defense law and rules tying eligibility to\nwhere the servicemember is stationed include an exception\nallowing \u201ccurrently enrolled students\u201d to remain throughout a\nschool year, even after their parent-sponsor has been assigned\nelsewhere. The statute states that\n\n      [t]he Secretary of Defense shall permit a dependent\n      of a member of the armed forces . . . to continue\n      enrollment in an educational program provided by\n      the Secretary . . . for the remainder of a school year\n      notwithstanding a change during such school year\n      in the status of the member . . . that, except for this\n      paragraph, would otherwise terminate the eligibility\n      of the dependent to be enrolled in the program.\n\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2164(h)(1). In similar terms, the implementing\nrule provides that, \u201c[i]f the status of the sponsor of a currently\nenrolled student changes so that the child would no longer be\neligible for enrollment,\u201d the student\u2019s enrollment nonetheless\n\u201cmay continue for the remainder of the school year.\u201d DoDI\n1342.26 \u00b6 6.3.7.\n\n      The record contains no credible information that Code\nknew no such exception applied to his children. Indeed, Code\u2019s\nunrebutted declaration attests to the contrary: When Code\ninformed the Fort Buchanan school Registrar that he had been\nreassigned to Texas, she assured him that the children could\ncomplete the year at the Fort Buchanan school because they\nhad validly enrolled based on his prior assignment. See Suppl.\nCode Decl. \u00b6 2 (J.A. 497). Even if that view misapprehends\nthe relevant rule, as the Secretary now argues and we assume,\nit is entirely plausible that the Registrar so understood it when\nshe spoke to Code.\n\f                               27\n     Indeed, the plausibility of Code\u2019s account of his\nunderstanding based on his exchange with the Registrar gains\npowerful support from the Army\u2019s own inconsistent usage of\nthe term \u201cenrolled.\u201d The Secretary now argues that children\nare only \u201cenrolled\u201d within the meaning of the currently-\nenrolled-student exception once classes are underway in the\ncorresponding school year, whereas Code was reassigned\nduring the summer before school had resumed for the fall term,\nmaking his children ineligible to \u201ccontinue enrollment\u201d under\nthe exception.

To the contrary, once\nCode identified the absence of evidence supporting the Army\nCID\u2019s actions, it was not his obligation to disprove fraudulent\nintent.

Id. \u00a7 7410. But\nbecause pollutants are readily transported across large areas,\nwithout regard to state boundaries, upwind emissions can\nimpede downwind states\u2019 attainment of the national standards.\nTo address this unequal burden, section 110 includes a \u201cGood\nNeighbor Provision,\u201d which requires state plans to prohibit\nemissions that will \u201ccontribute significantly\u201d to nonattainment\nin any other state. Id. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The EPA has\ndeveloped a four-step framework to address Good Neighbor\nobligations in this context. At Step One, it identifies downwind\nareas projected to have trouble attaining the relevant air quality\nstandard. At Step Two, the EPA determines which upwind\nstates are \u201clinked\u201d to the downwind nonattainment sites. At\nStep Three, it calculates the optimal level of pollution control,\nconsidering the marginal cost of emission reductions and\nanticipated downwind air quality improvements. The EPA\nthen formulates an emissions budget for each state, accounting\nfor achievable reductions. Finally, at Step Four, the EPA\ntypically promulgates federal implementation plans that\nrequire upwind states\u2019 participation in a regional cap-and-trade\nprogram to bring about compliance with their Good Neighbor\nobligations.\n\n     Separately, Clean Air Act section 126(b) authorizes \u201c[a]ny\nState\u201d to petition the EPA for a finding that an upwind source\n\u201cemits or would emit\u201d in violation of the Good Neighbor\nProvision\u2019s prohibition. Id. \u00a7 7426(b). If the EPA makes the\nrequested finding, the offending source must cease operations\n\f                               4\nunless it complies with federally enforceable emission\nlimitations. In 2016 Maryland and Delaware filed section\n126(b) petitions requesting that the EPA impose additional\nlimitations on certain upwind sources that were purportedly\ncontributing to the two States\u2019 nonattainment of the national\nozone standards. Both States sought to require the optimization\nof existing selective catalytic reduction controls; Maryland also\naddressed the operation of selective non-catalytic reduction\ncontrols at two facilities and Delaware requested that one\nfacility burn only natural gas.\n\n     The EPA denied the petitions on October 5, 2018.\nBecause a section 126(b) petition seeks a finding that the\nupwind source has violated the Good Neighbor provision, the\nEPA applies the same four-step framework it developed in the\nimplementation of section 110. The EPA denied Delaware\u2019s\npetitions at Step One, finding that Delaware had not\ndemonstrated a current or future in-state air quality problem\nand that, under the EPA\u2019s own modeling, no such problem\nwould exist under either the 2008 or 2015 ozone standards.\nAlternatively, the EPA concluded that denial was warranted\nunder Step Three because Delaware failed to identify any\navailable cost-effective controls at the named sources.\nAlthough Maryland survived Steps One and Two, the EPA\ndenied its petition at Step Three. Like Delaware, Maryland\nfailed to identify further cost-effective emission reductions at\nsources operating with catalytic controls. For the remaining\nsources named in Maryland\u2019s petition, the EPA explained that\nnon-catalytic controls were not cost-effective in this context.\nMaryland, Delaware and a coalition of environmental groups\n(Citizen Petitioners) petition for review of the EPA\u2019s denials.\nAlthough we reject some of the EPA\u2019s Step One\ndeterminations, we find, with one exception, that it reasonably\ndenied the petitions at Step Three. We conclude, however, that\nthe EPA\u2019s explanation was inadequate with respect to non-\n\f                                   5\ncatalytic controls. We therefore grant Maryland\u2019s petition for\nreview in part and remand this issue to the EPA. We deny all\nother petitions for review.\n\n                           I. Background\n\nA. Statutory Framework\n\n     The Clean Air Act instructs the EPA to establish a primary\nand secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard\n(NAAQS), see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409, for each air pollutant \u201cwhich\nmay reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or\nwelfare,\u201d id. \u00a7 7408(a)(1)(A). 1 Once established by the EPA,\nthese standards \u201cbecome the centerpiece of a complex statutory\nregime aimed at reducing the pollutant\u2019s atmospheric\nconcentration.\u201d Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. EPA, 283 F.3d\n355, 358\u201359 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The EPA first promulgated the\nNAAQS for ground-level ozone, i.e., smog, in 1979. See\nRevisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for\nPhotochemical Oxidants, 44 Fed. Reg. 8202 (Feb. 8, 1979). In\n1997 it set the ozone NAAQS at a level of 80 parts per billion\n(ppb), measured over an eight-hour period. See National\nAmbient Air Quality Standards for Ozone, 62 Fed. Reg. 38,856\n(July 18, 1997). The EPA subsequently reduced the ozone\nNAAQS to 75 ppb in 2008, see National Ambient Air Quality\nStandards for Ozone, 73 Fed. Reg. 16,436 (Mar. 27, 2008), and,\nin 2015, to 70 ppb, see National Ambient Air Quality Standards\nfor Ozone, 80 Fed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).\n\n\n\n     1\n        A \u201cprimary\u201d NAAQS must specify the level of air quality\n\u201crequisite to protect the public health,\u201d while \u201callowing an adequate\nmargin of safety.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(b)(1). A \u201csecondary\u201d NAAQS,\non the other hand, \u201cspecif[ies] a level of air quality . . . requisite to\nprotect the public welfare.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7409(b)(2).\n\f                               6\n     To promote attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS,\nthe \u201cEPA, in coordination with state governments, divides the\ncountry geographically into \u2018[a]ir quality control region[s].\u2019\u201d\nNRDC v. EPA, 777 F.3d 456, 458 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (alterations\nin original) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407). \u201cSome areas lie within\na single state while others encompass portions of two or more\nstates.\u201d Del. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. & Envtl. Control v. EPA, 895\nF.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 2018). Once the EPA issues a new or\nrevised NAAQS, it \u201cdesignates each area as \u2018attainment,\u2019\n\u2018nonattainment,\u2019 or \u2018unclassifiable\u2019 with respect to the\nNAAQS.\u201d Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A), (B)). An\n\u201cattainment\u201d area meets the NAAQS, that is, the atmospheric\nconcentration of the regulated pollutant is less than the\nallowable level; an \u201cunclassifiable\u201d area, as the name suggests,\ncannot be classified due to the absence of available\ninformation; and a \u201cnonattainment\u201d area exceeds the NAAQS\nor contributes to a violation in a nearby area. 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A)(i)\u2013(iii).    Ozone nonattainment areas are\nfurther classified by operation of law, according to the severity\nof their air quality problems, as marginal, moderate, serious,\nsevere, or extreme. Id. \u00a7 7511(a)(1). These classifications\ndetermine how long the area has in order to attain the primary\nNAAQS. Id. An ozone nonattainment area that misses its\nattainment deadline is generally bumped up to the next highest\nclassification, id. \u00a7 7511(b)(2)(A), which \u201cimpose[s]\nadditional regulatory responsibilities on the states composing\nthat area,\u201d Del. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res., 895 F.3d at 94.\n\n    Following the promulgation of a NAAQS, each state must\nsubmit a state implementation plan (SIP) that \u201cprovides for\nimplementation, maintenance, and enforcement\u201d of the\nNAAQS within that state. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). For states\nin nonattainment areas, \u201cSIPs must show how the areas will\nachieve and maintain the relevant NAAQS.\u201d S. Coast Air\nQuality Mgmt. Dist. v. EPA, 882 F.3d 1138, 1143 (D.C. Cir.\n\f                                 7\n2018). In particular, SIPs for ozone nonattainment areas must\nadopt certain measures, see, e.g., id. at 1143\u201344, intended to\nbring about attainment \u201cas expeditiously as practicable\u201d and\nnot later than specific statutory deadlines, 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7511(a)(1). If a state fails to submit a SIP, or if its submission\nis incomplete or disapproved, the EPA must issue a federal\nimplementation plan (FIP) that requires the state to correct the\nidentified deficiency. Id. \u00a7 7410(c)(1).\n\n     State-level air quality regulation is an inherently\ncomplicated endeavor because \u201c[a]ir pollution is transient,\nheedless of state boundaries. Pollutants generated by upwind\nsources are often transported by air currents, sometimes over\nhundreds of miles, to downwind States.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer\nCity Generation, L.P., 572 U.S. 489, 496 (2014). For example,\nground-level ozone is not emitted directly into air. Rather, it is\nthe product of chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides\n(NOx) and non-methane volatile organic compounds in the\npresence of sunlight. See New York v. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 989\n(7th Cir. 1998). Thus, the upwind emission of ozone\nprecursors can seriously threaten downwind attainment of the\nozone NAAQS. \u201cAs the pollution travels out of state, upwind\nStates are relieved of the associated costs,\u201d which \u201care borne\ninstead by the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and\nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the steady\nstream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d EME Homer City, 572 U.S. at\n496.\n\n    To alleviate this potential inequity, Congress included a\nGood Neighbor Provision in the Clean Air Act. Under the\nGood Neighbor Provision, SIPs must prohibit in-state sources\n\u201cfrom emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will . . .\ncontribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with\nmaintenance by, any other State with respect to any\n[NAAQS].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i). If the SIP is\n\f                                 8\nincomplete or inadequate, a FIP may be necessary to address\nthe state\u2019s Good Neighbor obligations. See id. \u00a7 7410(c)(1).\n\n     Separate from the SIP and FIP process, Clean Air Act\nsection 126(b) authorizes \u201c[a]ny State or political subdivision\u201d\nto petition the EPA \u201cfor a finding that any major source or\ngroup of stationary sources emits or would emit any air\npollutant in violation of\u201d the Good Neighbor Provision. 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b). 2 The EPA must \u201cmake such a finding or\ndeny the petition\u201d within sixty days. Id. In other words, it\n\u201cmust act quickly . . . and not wait the potential several years\nthat it would take for states to fully adopt SIPs implementing\nnew NAAQS.\u201d GenOn REMA, LLC v. EPA, 722 F.3d 513, 520\n(3d Cir. 2013). But the EPA still must determine whether an\nupwind source has violated the Good Neighbor Provision and,\naccordingly, its evaluation of each section 126(b) petition is\ntied to its interpretation and implementation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision. Once a petition is granted, the offending\nsource must cease operations within three months unless it\ncomplies with EPA-mandated \u201cemission limitations.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7426(c).\n\nB. Regulatory History\n\n     In 2011 the EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule\n(CSAPR), which placed emission limitations on upwind states\nthat violated their Good Neighbor obligations with respect to\nthe 1997 and 2006 fine particulate matter NAAQS and the 1997\nozone NAAQS. See Federal Implementation Plans: Interstate\n\n    2\n       Although \u00a7 7426(b) refers to any emission \u201cin violation of the\nprohibition of section 7410(a)(2)(D)(ii),\u201d we have held that this\ncross-reference is a scrivener\u2019s error and should be read to refer to\nthe Good Neighbor Provision in \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i).               See\nAppalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 249 F.3d 1032, 1040\u201344 (D.C. Cir.\n2001) (per curiam).\n\f                                9\nTransport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction\nof SIP Approvals, 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208 (Aug. 8, 2011). To\naccount for the revised ozone NAAQS, the EPA promulgated\nan update to the CSAPR in 2016. See Cross-State Pollution\nRule Update for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS, 81 Fed. Reg. 74,504\n(Oct. 26, 2016) [hereinafter Update Rule]. The Update Rule\nfinalized FIPs to address twenty-two states\u2019 Good Neighbor\nobligations with respect to the more-stringent 2008 ozone\nNAAQS. Substantively, the Update Rule established further\nlimits on ozone season 3 NOx emissions from electric\ngenerating units (EGUs) in those states. Id. at 74,507. To\nquantify the necessary reductions, the EPA applied a four-step\nframework.\n\n     At Step One, the EPA considered current and modeled\nfuture air quality data at downwind monitors (i.e., receptors) to\nidentify areas expected to have trouble attaining or maintaining\nthe 2008 ozone NAAQS. Id. at 74,517. The EPA utilized a\nmonitoring site\u2019s earlier \u201cdesign values\u201d\u2014a three-year\nhistorical average of a receptor\u2019s air quality data\u2014to generate\nmultiple ozone-level projections for 2017. Id. at 74,532. With\nthe 2008 ozone NAAQS of 75 ppb, any receptor with a\nprojected design value of less than 76 ppb was determined to\nbe in attainment. See id. A receptor was designated\nnonattainment if its average projected design value and its most\nrecent monitored design value (2013\u20132015) equaled or\nexceeded 76 ppb. Id. In addition, the EPA defined a\n\u201cmaintenance\u201d receptor as any site that is currently in\n\n    3\n       The ozone season runs May 1 through September 30. See\nUpdate Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 74,507. \u201cOzone levels are generally\nhigher during the summer months\u201d because \u201c[t]he potential for\nground-level ozone formation increases during periods with warmer\ntemperatures and stagnant air masses.\u201d Id. at 74,513. Reducing\nemissions during this timeframe is thus a critical component of the\nEPA\u2019s regulatory approach.\n\f                               10\nattainment but has a projected average design value that\nexceeds the NAAQS, or that has an average design value below\nthe NAAQS but a maximum projected design value of 76 ppb\nor greater. Id.\n\n      At Step Two, the EPA identified the upwind states\n\u201clinked\u201d to nonattainment or maintenance at downwind\nmonitors. Id. at 74,518. First, the EPA calculated each state\u2019s\ncontribution to downwind ozone formation. Next, because the\nGood Neighbor Provision prohibits only those emissions that\n\u201ccontribute significantly to nonattainment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with\nmaintenance,\u201d the EPA screened out upwind states that\ncontributed less than one per cent of the 2008 ozone NAAQS\n(i.e., 0.75 ppb) to ozone formation in a downwind state. Id. at\n74,537. Simply put, only those \u201cStates . . . whose contributions\nto a specific receptor meet or exceed the screening threshold\nare considered linked to that receptor.\u201d Id.\n\n     At Step Three, the EPA applied a multifactor test\u2014\nconsidering cost, NOx reduction potential, and downwind air\nquality impacts\u2014to quantify the magnitude of the emission\nreductions required by the Good Neighbor Provision. Id. at\n74,519. The EPA measured the expected reductions at\ndifferent cost-control levels: $800/ton, $1,400/ton, $3,400/ton,\n$5,000/ton, and $6,400/ton. Id. at 74,540\u201342. \u201cEach level . . .\nrepresents an estimated marginal cost per ton of NOx reduced\nand is characterized by a set of pollution control measures.\u201d Id.\nat 74,540. For each cost-control level, the EPA also estimated\ncorresponding air quality improvements at downwind\nreceptors. It ultimately concluded that a control cost of $1,400\nper ton\u2014which represents turning on and fully operating\nexisting, idled selective catalytic reduction controls\u2014\nconstituted the point \u201cat which incremental EGU NOx\nreduction potential and corresponding downwind ozone air\nquality improvements are maximized with respect to marginal\n\f                              11\ncost.\u201d Id. at 74,550. The EPA then quantified each state\u2019s\nemissions \u201cbudget\u201d by projecting the emissions that would\noccur under $1,400 per ton cost controls. Id. at 74,553.\nEmissions that can be reduced at or below the selected control\nlevel are considered \u201csignificant\u201d for purposes of Good\nNeighbor compliance. See EPA Br. 10.\n\n     Finally, at Step Four, the EPA implemented an allowance\ntrading program to achieve the required emission reductions.\nSee Update Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 74,521. Each state receives\nan allocation of individual allowances authorizing the emission\nof a designated quantity of ozone season NOx. Id. at 74,554.\nThe total allowances equal that state\u2019s emissions budget and\nare allocated among sources in that state. Because allowances\ncan be bought and sold through market transactions, sources\ncan emit more NOx than otherwise permitted by purchasing\nadditional allowances. Id. Each state, however, can emit no\nmore than 121 per cent of its emissions budget. Id.\n\n     Importantly, the Update Rule was promulgated as a partial\nremedy.      Because downwind states with a moderate\nnonattainment classification faced a July 2018 attainment\ndeadline, the EPA focused solely on near-term emission\nreductions. See id. at 74,540 (\u201c[T]he EPA limited its analysis\nof potential NOx reductions in each upwind state to those that\ncould be feasibly implemented for the 2017 ozone season,\nwhich is the last full ozone season prior to the July 20, 2018\nattainment date.\u201d). Accordingly, analysis of further controls\nwas anticipated \u201cin any future action that may be necessary to\naddress upwind states\u2019 full emission reduction obligations with\nrespect to the 2008 ozone standard.\u201d Id. A number of parties\nchallenged the Update Rule and we invalidated it in part. See\nWisconsin v. EPA, 938 F.3d 303, 309 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per\ncuriam). Because upwind states could continue to significantly\ncontribute to downwind air quality beyond the downwind\n\f                               12\nattainment deadline, we concluded the Update Rule was\ninconsistent with the Clean Air Act, which \u201crequire[s] upwind\nStates to eliminate their significant contributions in accordance\nwith the deadline by which downwind States must come into\ncompliance with the NAAQS.\u201d Id. at 313.\n\n     In December 2018, the EPA promulgated the Close-Out\nRule.     See Determination Regarding Good Neighbor\nObligations for the 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality\nStandard, 83 Fed. Reg. 65,878 (Dec. 21, 2018) [hereinafter\nClose-Out Rule]. The Close-Out Rule found that, for the 2008\nozone NAAQS, it was not feasible to implement cost-effective\nemissions controls before 2023\u2014two years after the 2021\nattainment deadline for serious areas\u2014and, moreover, that all\ndownwind states would attain the NAAQS by 2023 even\nwithout further upwind emission reductions. Id. at 65,904\u201305,\n65,917. Due in part to its finding that regionwide NOx\nemissions had declined twenty-one per cent in the Update\nRule\u2019s first year, id. at 65,899, the EPA concluded that the\nUpdate Rule fully resolved the Good Neighbor obligations for\ntwenty upwind states, id. at 65,879. We vacated the Close-Out\nRule because it relied on the same statutory interpretation of\nthe Good Neighbor Provision that Wisconsin rejected. New\nYork v. EPA, 781 F. App\u2019x 4 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam).\n\nC. Procedural History\n\n     In 2016, Maryland and Delaware both filed section 126(b)\npetitions with the EPA. Maryland\u2019s sole petition alleged that\nthirty-six EGUs, in \u201cfive upwind states that EPA ha[d] already\ndetermined are significantly contributing to Maryland\u2019s ozone\nproblem,\u201d were violating the Good Neighbor Provision with\nrespect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Md. Cover Ltr at 1 (J.A.\n48). According to Maryland, 2015 ozone season monitoring\ndata demonstrated that these units either were not optimizing\n\f                               13\ntheir existing controls or had ceased running these controls\nregularly during the ozone season. Md. Pet. at 4\u20135 (J.A. 53\u2013\n54). Contending that the EPA\u2019s regional cap-and-trade\napproach did not prevent sources from emitting above\nachievable limits on particularly bad ozone days, id. at 3 (J.A.\n52), Maryland requested source-specific limitations that would\nrequire the \u201ctargeted EGUs to run their existing NOx control\ntechnology effectively on each day of the ozone season,\u201d id. at\n4 (J.A. 53).\n\n     Delaware submitted four petitions, each addressing a\ndifferent upwind facility. All four petitions requested a finding\nthat EGUs at the named facilities violated the Good Neighbor\nProvision with respect to both the 2008 and 2015 NAAQS.\nDelaware alleged that three of the facilities were not optimizing\ntheir existing controls. The fourth facility\u2014the Brunner Island\npower plant in Pennsylvania (Brunner Island)\u2014did not have\ncatalytic controls installed. It was, however, then in the process\nof adding natural gas capacity. Delaware maintained that\nBrunner Island\u2019s continued ability to burn coal warranted the\nimposition of short-term NOx emission limits and asked the\nEPA to impose an enforceable requirement that Brunner Island\nburn only natural gas. Del. Brunner Island Pet. at 20, 22 (J.A.\n238, 240).\n\n     Although section 126(b) requires the EPA to act within\nsixty days after receipt of a petition, the EPA sought to extend\nits deadline by six months pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(10).\nBut the EPA failed to hold a public hearing or otherwise act on\nMaryland\u2019s petition by the new deadline. Maryland filed suit\nand the United States District Court for the District of\nMaryland ordered the EPA to \u201csign a notice taking final agency\naction on Maryland\u2019s petition on or before September 15,\n2018.\u201d Maryland v. Pruitt, 320 F. Supp. 3d 722, 732 (D. Md.\n2018). The EPA proposed to deny the Maryland and Delaware\n\f                                   14\npetitions on June 8, 2018, see Response to Clean Air Act\nSection 126(b) Petitions from Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed.\nReg. 26,666 (June 8, 2018) and finalized the denials on October\n5, 2018, see Response to Clear Air Act Section 126(b) Petitions\nfrom Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. 50,444 (Oct. 5,\n2018) [hereinafter Response to Delaware and Maryland].\n\n     The EPA, using the same four-step Good Neighbor\nframework it applied in the Update Rule, concluded that neither\nMaryland nor Delaware could establish a Good Neighbor\nviolation. First, the EPA determined that Maryland satisfied\nSteps One and Two because the EPA modeled a 2017\nmaintenance problem at Maryland\u2019s Harford County receptor\nfor the 2008 ozone NAAQS and the upwind states named in\nMaryland\u2019s petition are linked to that receptor according to the\nEPA\u2019s contribution modeling. Id. at 50,464. Maryland\u2019s\npetition failed, however, at Step Three. Maryland requested\nthat EGUs be required to operate and optimize existing\ncatalytic controls.4 But, because this same control strategy was\nalready reflected in the Update Rule\u2019s emissions budgets, the\nEPA determined that \u201call identified cost-effective emission\nreductions have already been implemented for the 2008 ozone\nNAAQS with respect to the\u201d identified sources. Id. This was\nso, the EPA said, based on both \u201ca conceptual case as to why\nthose reductions will be achieved through the [Update Rule\u2019s]\nexisting allowance trading program, and an evidence-based\ncase that reductions based on control optimization [were]\nalready achieved in 2017.\u201d Id. at 50,462.\n\n\n     4\n       Catalytic and non-catalytic controls both involve injecting a\nreagent into an exhaust flue, where it reacts with NOx to produce\nmolecular nitrogen and water. As their names suggest, catalytic\ncontrols facilitate this reaction with a catalyst. Non-catalytic controls\ndo not. See Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 135 F.3d 791, 798 nn.7\u2013\n8 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam).\n\f                               15\n     As for EGUs operating selective non-catalytic reduction\ncontrols, the EPA concluded \u201cthat fully operating with [non-\ncatalytic controls] is not a cost-effective NOx emissions\nreduction strategy for these sources.\u201d Id. at 50,469. Although\nMaryland submitted a comment asking the EPA to assess its\npetition under the 2015 ozone NAAQS, the EPA declined to do\nso, finding that Maryland\u2019s petition had requested a decision\nwith respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS only. Id. at 50,463.\n\n     The EPA denied Delaware\u2019s petitions at Steps One and\nTwo and, in the alternative, at Step Three. First, Delaware\nfailed to satisfy its purported burden under section 126(b) to\ndemonstrate \u201cthat there is a current or future nonattainment or\nmaintenance problem in Delaware based on violations of the\n[2008 or 2015 ozone] NAAQS, []or that the named sources are\nimproperly impacting downwind air quality on days when such\nviolations would be expected.\u201d Id. at 50,457. Delaware\u2019s\nidentification of individual exceedances (i.e., an eight-hour\nmeasurement above the NAAQS) at its own monitors was\ninsufficient because the EPA considers \u201c[v]iolations, rather\nthan exceedances\u201d as \u201cthe relevant metric for identifying\nnonattainment and maintenance problems.\u201d Id. at 50,456. Nor\ndid the fact that areas of Delaware were designated\nnonattainment for the 2008 NAAQS indicate, by itself, that the\nState would have future attainment problems. Id. Under the\nEPA\u2019s interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision, if a\ndownwind state will attain the NAAQS without further upwind\nreductions, there is no air quality problem necessitating\nadditional emission limitations. Otherwise, the EPA would\nover-control upwind states by imposing limitations on\nemissions that do not significantly contribute to downwind\nnonattainment. Id. For this reason, although commenters\nidentified Delaware monitors that were currently exceeding the\n2015 ozone NAAQS, the commenters failed to \u201cidentify any\nprojected air quality violations in a future year associated with\n\f                                16\nthe relevant attainment dates.\u201d Id. Commenters also identified\nmonitors in the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City\nnonattainment area that were violating the 2008 and 2015\nozone NAAQS. Because Delaware\u2019s New Castle County is\nincluded in this multistate area, the commenters argued that\n\u201cDelaware\u2019s attainment of the ozone NAAQS is tied to the\nattainment of the other monitors in the nonattainment area.\u201d Id.\nat 50,460. But the EPA interpreted section 126(b) to authorize\nfindings only with respect to downwind receptors within the\npetitioning state and, accordingly, declined to consider these\ndata. Id.\n\n     Although the EPA found Delaware\u2019s conclusions\nunsupported and technically deficient, id. at 50,456, it\nnevertheless proceeded to analyze independently Delaware\u2019s\npetitions at Step One. Relying on the modeling it conducted in\nconnection with the Update Rule, the EPA determined that\nDelaware was not projected to have any nonattainment or\nmaintenance receptors with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS\nand its most recent design values were not to the contrary. Id.\nat 50,458. And, although the modeling evinced air quality\nproblems in Delaware for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, the EPA\ndeemed upwind control unnecessary because it projected\nDelaware to attain the 2015 ozone NAAQS by 2023. Id. at\n50,459. Even though Delaware is first subject to the 2021\nmarginal nonattainment deadline,5 the EPA determined that\n2023 is in fact the relevant future analytic year because it is the\n\n    5\n       New Castle County was designated as marginal nonattainment\nfor the 2015 ozone NAAQS given its inclusion in the Philadelphia-\nWilmington-Atlantic City multistate nonattainment area.          See\nAdditional Air Quality Designations for the 2015 Ozone National\nAmbient Air Quality Standards, 83 Fed. Reg. 25,776, 25,794 (June\n4, 2018). The three-year attainment deadline for marginal areas runs\nfrom 2018, when the area was designated under the 2015 NAAQS.\nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1); NRDC, 777 F.3d at 464\u201366.\n\f                               17\nlast full year that will inform analysis of the 2024 moderate\nattainment deadline\u2014the first deadline requiring downwind\nstates to implement controls on existing sources. Id. at 50,461.\n\n     Notwithstanding the EPA\u2019s denial of Delaware\u2019s petitions\nat Step One, it found, in the alternative, that Step Three\nconstituted an independent basis for denial. Three of\nDelaware\u2019s petitions pertained to sources with catalytic\ncontrols. As with Maryland\u2019s petition, the EPA determined\nthat emission reductions associated with the operation of\ncatalytic controls were already implemented through the\nUpdate Rule. Id. at 50,465. Delaware\u2019s Brunner Island\npetition also failed to show that the facility \u201cemits or would\nemit in violation\u201d of the Good Neighbor Provision. Id. at\n50,470. Brunner Island primarily burned natural gas during the\n2017 ozone season, achieving emission reductions consistent\nwith Delaware\u2019s proposed control strategy. Id. at 50,470\u201371.\nAccordingly, the EPA concluded that \u201cno additional feasible\nand cost-effective NOx emissions reductions . . . have been\nidentified.\u201d Id. at 50,470. And, because the EPA predicted that\nBrunner Island would continue to burn natural gas for\neconomic reasons, it found that the facility would not emit in\nviolation of its Good Neighbor obligations. Id. at 50,471.\n\n    Maryland, Delaware, and Citizen Petitioners (collectively,\nthe Petitioners) petition for review, challenging the denial of\nDelaware\u2019s petitions at Step One of the Good Neighbor\nframework and the denial of both States\u2019 petitions at Step\nThree. New York, New Jersey, and New York City6 intervened\n\n    6\n        The EPA recently denied a Section 126 petition from New\nYork on substantially similar grounds. See Response to Clean Air\nAct Section 126(b) Petition from New York, 84 Fed. Reg. 56,058\n(Oct. 18, 2019). New York, New Jersey, and New York City have\npetitioned for review of that denial. New York v. EPA, No. 19-1231\n(D.C. Cir. filed Oct. 29, 2019).\n\f                                18\non behalf of the Petitioners and several power companies\nintervened in support of the EPA.\n\n      We have jurisdiction under the Clean Air Act. See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). We may reverse any EPA action found\nto be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\nnot in accordance with law.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7607(d)(9)(A).

EPA, 937 F.3d 559, 574 (D.C.\nCir. 2019) (per curiam).\n\n       II. Denial of Delaware\u2019s Petitions at Step One\n\n     The Petitioners first argue that the EPA arbitrarily denied\nDelaware\u2019s section 126(b) petitions at Step One. They assert\nthat the EPA impermissibly refused to consider data from an\nout-of-state receptor and data regarding nonattainment before\n2023. The EPA contests both points. In addition, it contends\n\f                                19\nthat, regardless of whether its own analysis was flawed,\nDelaware bore the burden of proof and failed to meet it.\n\nA. Burden of Proof\n\n     We first consider whether the EPA permissibly assigned\nthe burden of proof to Delaware. On this question of statutory\nconstruction, we ask only whether the EPA\u2019s position\nreasonably interprets the governing provisions of the Clean Air\nAct. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842\u201344\n(1984).\n\n    We begin with statutory text. Section 126(b) provides that\n\u201c[a]ny State or political subdivision may petition the\nAdministrator for a finding\u201d of a violation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b). Section 126(b)\nmakes clear that the petitioning state must initiate the process.\nAs a general \u201cdefault rule,\u201d the burden of proof falls \u201cupon the\nparty seeking relief.\u201d Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast, 546\nU.S. 49, 57\u201358 (2005) (civil litigation). The same rule governs\nformal proceedings under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 556(d) (\u201c[T]he proponent of a rule or order has the\nburden of proof.\u201d). And the provision of the Clean Air Act\ngoverning section 126(b) proceedings does nothing to displace\nthe default rule. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d). This strongly\nsuggests that the default rule should apply. See Astoria Fed.\nSav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991).\n\n    Statutory context reinforces this conclusion. The Clean\nAir Act requires the EPA to resolve a section 126(b) petition\n\u201c[w]ithin 60 days after receipt . . . and after public hearing,\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b), though the EPA may extend the deadline to\nsix months, id. \u00a7 7607(d)(10). In New York v. EPA, 852 F.2d\n574 (D.C. Cir. 1988), we held that this compressed timeline\nsupports requiring the petitioning state to bear the burden of\n\f                               20\nproof. There, three states argued that section 126(b) required\nthe EPA \u201cto take the investigatory steps necessary to determine\nwhether\u201d there was any violation of the Good Neighbor\nProvision. Id. at 578. We rejected this contention that the EPA\nmust itself \u201cconduct whatever data-gathering and research is\nnecessary to either prove . . . or affirmatively disprove\u201d a\nstate\u2019s allegations. Id. Given the sixty-day deadline, we\nthought it \u201creasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend\nthat the Administrator be required to perform all these duties in\nsuch a short period of time.\u201d Id.\n\n     We recognize that the petitioning states in New York\nsought to compel the EPA to evaluate entire SIPs, whereas\nDelaware seeks only a finding that individual upwind sources\nemit excessively. This distinction makes little difference, for\nany evaluation under the Good Neighbor Provision requires\ntime-intensive research and analysis assessing air quality\nproblems in the petitioning downwind state, the cause of those\nproblems in upwind states, and the cost-effectiveness of\npossible solutions. As we explained in New York, these tasks\nare at odds with a sixty-day deadline. We therefore hold that\nthe EPA reasonably interpreted section 126(b) to require\nDelaware to bear the burden of proof.\n\nB. Consideration of Out-of-State Monitors\n\n     We now address the EPA\u2019s decision not to consider air\nquality data from non-attaining receptors outside Delaware,\n\u201ceven if such monitors are located in a multistate\nnonattainment area that includes [Delaware].\u201d Response to\nDelaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,460. The EPA\nconstrues the \u201cpetition authority\u201d set out in section 126(b) as\n\u201climited to states and political subdivisions seeking to address\ninterstate transport of pollution impacting downwind receptors\nwithin their geographical borders.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\f                                 21\nDelaware and Petitioner-Intervenors assert that section 126(b)\nplainly authorizes Delaware to petition based on out-of-state\nmonitoring data or, alternatively, that the EPA\u2019s statutory\ninterpretation is unreasonable.\n\n     Again, we start with the text. See NRDC v. Browner, 57\nF.3d 1122, 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1995). In relevant part, section\n126(b) provides that \u201c[a]ny State or political subdivision may\npetition the Administrator for a finding that any major source\nor group of stationary sources emits or would emit any air\npollutant in violation of [the Good Neighbor Provision].\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b). Starting with the premise that \u201c[a]ny State\u201d\ncan file a section 126(b) petition, Delaware contends the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation conflicts with the statute\u2019s plain meaning\nbecause the text does not \u201cexplicitly bar[] a state from\npetitioning EPA for a finding that a source is affecting\ndownwind receptors in another state.\u201d Del. Br. 19. Delaware\u2019s\nemphasis is misplaced\u2014a liberal construction of \u201c[a]ny State\u201d\ndoes not mandate a similarly expansive scope for the petition\nitself. 7 In other words, that any state can petition the EPA says\n\n     7\n        The parties\u2019 discussion of Delaware Department of Natural\nResources is largely beside the point. There, we considered whether\nan attainment-date extension, which may be granted \u201c[u]pon\napplication by any State,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(5), required every\nstate in a multistate area to request the extension. Resolving the\nquestion at Chevron step one, we held that \u201c\u2018any State\u2019\nunambiguously permits EPA to consider an application filed by\nfewer than all states in a multistate nonattainment area.\u201d Del. Dep\u2019t\nof Nat. Res., 895 F.3d at 99. Here, there is no dispute that a single\nstate within a multistate nonattainment area can file a section 126(b)\npetition based on air pollution within its own borders. The fact that\n\u201cany State\u201d was given unambiguous meaning in a different context\ndoes not resolve whether \u201cany State\u201d can file a section 126(b)\npetition to determine whether an upwind source is contributing to air\npollution in a different state.\n\f                              22\nnothing about whether the petitioning state can rely on air\nquality data from a different state to support its requested\nfinding that an upwind source violates the Good Neighbor\nProvision. Although Delaware construes this silence in its\nfavor, the fact remains that Congress \u201chas [not] directly spoken\nto the precise question at issue.\u201d Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.\n\n     We turn, therefore, to Chevron step two, where \u201cwe\npresume that when an agency-administered statute is\nambiguous with respect to what it prescribes, Congress has\nempowered the agency to resolve the ambiguity. The question\nfor a reviewing court is whether in doing so the agency has\nacted reasonably and thus has \u2018stayed within the bounds of its\nstatutory authority.\u2019\u201d Util. Air Regulatory Grp., 573 U.S. at\n315 (quoting City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297\n(2013)). Although we defer to a permissible construction of\nthe Clean Air Act, the EPA\u2019s interpretation must be\n\u201creasonable in light of the Act\u2019s text, legislative history, and\npurpose.\u201d Allied Local & Reg\u2019l Mfrs. Caucus, 215 F.3d at 68\n(citation omitted).\n\n     The EPA primarily argues that statutory context dictates a\nnarrow construction for section 126(b) petitions. First, other\nClean Air Act provisions \u201cthat contain petition authority . . .\nexpressly allow for any person to petition the EPA\u201d whereas\nsection 126(b) is limited to states and political subdivisions.\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,460\n(emphasis added); see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7661d(b)(2). But this\nobservation has little bearing on the question before us. \u201cAny\nState\u201d plainly includes Delaware and the fact that the section\n126(b) petition process is comparatively circumscribed does\nnot mean an otherwise qualified petitioner is thereafter subject\nto additional, implicit limitations. Next, the EPA contends that\n\u201cthe context of . . . section 126 as a whole suggests these\nprovisions are meant to moderate interstate transport concerns\n\f                               23\nbetween affected states and upwind sources, not between any\nthird party (even if such party is another state) and upwind\nsources.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg.\nat 50,460 (emphasis added). For example, section 126(a)\nrequires certain upwind sources \u201cto provide written notice to\nall nearby States the air pollution levels of which may be\naffected by such source.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1). The EPA\nimports this language into section 126(b), reading in a\nrequirement that the petitioning state be \u201cdirectly affected by\nupwind pollution.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,460 (emphasis added). And, according to the\nEPA, Delaware is not \u201caffected\u201d because it has provided no\nevidence of an in-state air quality problem.\n\n     The EPA\u2019s position is unavailing. Although Congress, in\nsection 126(a), referred specifically to \u201cStates . . . which may\nbe affected by such [upwind] source,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1),\nit included no analogous limitation in section 126(b).\nMoreover, it is not at all obvious when a state is \u201caffected.\u201d\nIndeed, section 126(a) requires a new or modified source to\nprovide written notice if it \u201cmay significantly contribute to\nlevels of air pollution in excess of the [NAAQS] in any air\nquality control region outside\u201d the source\u2019s own state. Id.\n\u00a7 7426(a)(1)(B). Because \u201cair quality control regions\u201d include\nmultistate areas, id. \u00a7 7407(b)(1), (c), it is unclear whether all\nstates in a shared nonattainment area are \u201caffected\u201d\u2014and are\ntherefore owed written notice\u2014regardless of where in the\nmultistate area the offending air pollution is measured. Thus,\neven accepting the EPA\u2019s proffered interpretation\u2014that only\naffected states may file section 126(b) petitions to protect\nagainst violating upwind sources\u2014the same ambiguity arises.\n\n     Although statutory context, on its own, does not resolve\nmatters, the EPA also found that \u201cthe legislative history for\n[section 126(b)] suggests the provision was meant to address\n\f                                 24\nadverse air impacts only in the petitioning state.\u201d Response to\nDelaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,460. Its brief foray\ninto the legislative history is, at best, unilluminating. It relies\nsolely on the Conference Report accompanying the Clean Air\nAct Amendments of 1977, which added section 126. The\nSenate\u2019s proposed amendment is described in the Report as\ncabining section 126(b)\u2019s petition authority to findings that an\nupwind source \u201cadversely affect[s] the air quality in the\npetitioning State.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 95-564, at 146 (1977) (Conf.\nRep.). This summary language, which the EPA erroneously\nascribes to the amendment itself, see Response to Delaware and\nMaryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,460 n.47, does not appear in the\nenacted text, see Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L.\nNo. 95-95, \u00a7 123, 91 Stat. 685, 724. Nor does the EPA suggest\nthis limitation was considered and debated, beyond its brief\nassertion that \u201c[t]he House concurred with the Senate\u2019s\namendment\u201d and, despite making revisions elsewhere, \u201cdid not\nindicate changes to this sentence.\u201d Response to Delaware and\nMaryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,460 n.47.\n\n     Delaware and Petitioner-Intervenors contend that, even if\na state must be \u201caffected\u201d in order to file a section 126(b)\npetition, \u201cupwind emissions that impact non-attaining\nreceptors within a multistate nonattainment area affect all of the\nincluded states\u2019 air quality . . . , regardless of where the\nparticular non-attaining receptor happens to be located.\u201d Del.\nReply Br. 4. First, because ozone and its precursor pollutants\nare easily transported over large areas, without regard to\npolitical boundaries, selectively placed ozone monitors are\nintended to \u201cserve as proxies for identifying broader air quality\nproblems.\u201d Pet\u2019r-Intervenors Br. 29.8 Consequently, a\n    8\n        The EPA objects that Petitioner-Intervenors\u2019 argument was\nnot raised in the comment period and is therefore forfeited. See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B) (\u201cOnly an objection . . . raised with\nreasonable specificity during the period for public comment . . . may\n\f                                  25\nviolating monitor anywhere in the shared nonattainment area\nsignals that other locations may face similar problems.\n\n     Second, for states in a shared nonattainment area, out-of-\nstate receptors can cause very real regulatory consequences.\nBecause a nonattainment area includes \u201cany area . . . that\ncontributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not\nmeet\u201d the ozone NAAQS, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A)(i), a\nstate\u2019s attainment status is necessarily linked to all other states\ncomprising the multistate area. A non-attaining receptor\nanywhere in the multistate area causes the entire area to be\ndesignated nonattainment and, in turn, the states must\ncoordinate a collective response irrespective of the offending\nmonitor\u2019s location. See id. \u00a7 7511a(j)(1). Thus, Delaware and\nPetitioner-Intervenors attack the EPA\u2019s notion that considering\nmonitoring data from outside the petitioning state would\nimpermissibly \u201callow states to act in the role of citizen\nattorneys general on behalf of other states.\u201d EPA Br. 39. They\nmaintain that, to the contrary, a state acts on its own behalf\nwhen it raises a shared nonattainment problem because its own\n\n\n\n\nbe raised during judicial review.\u201d). \u201cBut the word \u2018reasonable\u2019\ncannot be read out of the statute in favor of a hair-splitting approach.\nIn other words, the Act does not require that precisely the same\nargument that was made before the agency be rehearsed again, word\nfor word, on judicial review.\u201d Appalachian Power Co., 135 F.3d at\n817\u201318. In its comments, Delaware argued that its attainment status\nwas tied to the status of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City\nnonattainment area. See Del. Cmts. at 4 (J.A. 345). This is largely\nthe same argument now offered by Petitioner-Intervenors. And\nbecause the EPA has \u201cconsidered the particular challenge raised on\njudicial review, it is of no import whether that challenge is phrased\nin exactly the same way in each forum.\u201d Appalachian Power Co.,\n135 F.3d at 818.\n\f                              26\nattainment status has been affected by the upwind source. We\nagree.\n\n     The untenability of the EPA\u2019s interpretation is clear when\nwe consider its practical effect on the section 126(b) petition\nprocess. Section 126(b) permits downwind states to petition\nfor a finding that an upwind source is violating the Good\nNeighbor Provision, which prohibits emissions that will\n\u201ccontribute significantly to nonattainment in . . . any other\nState.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). There is no dispute\nthat Delaware could file a section 126(b) petition to address an\nupwind source\u2019s contribution to an in-state non-attaining\nreceptor. But, according to the EPA, Delaware has no recourse\nif its regulatory burden is attributable to a monitor in\nPennsylvania, even though Delaware remains bound by the\ncorresponding nonattainment designation. And, because\nDelaware cannot compel another state to file a section 126(b)\npetition, it is stuck in regulatory limbo, affected by an upwind\nsource yet unable to avail itself of the intended remedy for\naddressing upwind contributions to nonattainment.\n\n     The EPA\u2019s efforts to explain away this incongruity fall\nflat. First, the EPA contends that \u201cconcerns about the impacts\nof upwind pollution on out-of-state monitors in a shared\nmultistate nonattainment area . . . can be addressed under other\nstatutory processes.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,460. But the Clean Air Act creates the section\n126(b) petition process as an alternative to the use of\nimplementation plans. See supra at 8. Indeed, with respect to\nthe requirements of the Good Neighbor Provision and section\n126, \u201cthe EPA has consistently acknowledged that Congress\ncreated these provisions as two independent statutory processes\nto address the problem of interstate pollution transport.\u201d\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,452.\nThe EPA cannot ignore section 126(b)\u2019s standalone remedy\n\f                                27\nsimply because it has other regulatory options at its disposal.\nNext, the EPA asserts that Delaware\u2019s obligations as a member\nof a multistate nonattainment area should have no bearing on\nthe EPA\u2019s interpretation of section 126(b).             Granted,\n\u201c[p]ortions of Delaware were included in the Philadelphia\nnonattainment area because . . . those portions were themselves\ncontributing to the air quality problems in Pennsylvania.\u201d Id.\nat 50,460. But, contrary to the EPA\u2019s characterization,\nDelaware is not trying to \u201crelieve [itself] . . . of the specific\nplanning obligations associated with its inclusion in an area\ndesignated nonattainment.\u201d Id. Rather, it asks merely that\nupwind sources contributing to air quality problems in the\nmultistate nonattainment area shoulder a comparable\nregulatory burden, as the section 126(b) petition process\ncontemplates.\n\n     In sum, states in a multistate nonattainment area share not\nonly a nonattainment designation but also the concomitant\nresponsibility to limit their own emissions. To equalize the\nburdens between upwind and downwind states, the Clean Air\nAct authorizes a state to petition the EPA for a finding that\nupwind emissions significantly contribute to that state\u2019s\nnonattainment of the ozone NAAQS. But, under the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation, a state cannot file a section 126(b) petition if its\nnonattainment status is caused by a receptor outside its political\nboundaries, even as the state remains burdened by the\ncorresponding regulatory obligations. It is arbitrary for the\nEPA to subject states like Delaware to this burden while\ndenying access to the intended remedy. Cf. Catawba Cty., 571\nF.3d at 39 (\u201c[S]tatutory interpretation that is arbitrary and\ncapricious is unreasonable under Chevron step two.\u201d (citing\nNorthpoint Tech., Ltd. v. FCC, 412 F.3d 145, 151 (D.C. Cir.\n2005))). We therefore conclude that the EPA\u2019s interpretation\nof section 126(b) is unreasonable, at least if the petition\ninvolves \u201cmonitors . . . located in a multistate nonattainment\n\f                              28\narea that includes the petitioning state.\u201d Response to Delaware\nand Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. 50,460. Accordingly, the EPA\ncould not ignore Delaware\u2019s evidence of non-attaining\nreceptors in the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City\nnonattainment area.\n\nC. Selection of Year to Measure Air Quality\n\n     We next consider a question of timing: In evaluating a\nsection 126(b) petition at Step One, for what year must the EPA\nassess nonattainment in the downwind state? The Petitioners\nargue that the EPA must focus on current nonattainment or, at\na minimum, nonattainment at the next future attainment\ndeadline applicable to the petitioning downwind state. We\ndisagree with the Petitioners on the first point, but we agree\nwith them on the second.\n\n    1. Current Nonattainment\n\n     The Petitioners contend that current nonattainment is\nenough to satisfy Step One. The EPA responds that section\n126(b), like the Good Neighbor Provision, concerns only\nnonattainment that will last into the future. Again, the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute is reasonable.\n\n     Section 126(b) requires a finding on whether an upwind\nsource \u201cemits or would emit\u201d a pollutant in violation of the\nGood Neighbor Provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b). By cross-\nreferencing the Good Neighbor Provision, \u201cCongress clearly\nhinged the meaning of \u00a7 126 on that of\u201d the Good Neighbor\nProvision. Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 249 F.3d 1032,\n1049\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (per curiam). As a result, \u201cthe\nsubstantive inquiry for decision is the same\u201d under both\nprovisions. Id. at 1047 (quotation marks omitted).\n\f                               29\n     The Good Neighbor Provision requires SIPs to prohibit\nany in-state source \u201cfrom emitting any air pollutant in amounts\nwhich will . . . contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or\ninterfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect to\nany [NAAQS].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i). In determining\nthe temporal scope of this rule, the key word is \u201cwill.\u201d In North\nCarolina v. EPA, 531 F.3d 896 (D.C. Cir.) (per curiam),\nmodified on reh\u2019g in part, 550 F.3d 1176 (D.C. Cir. 2008), we\nheld that the EPA reasonably construed \u201cwill\u201d\u2014which denotes\nthe future tense\u2014to limit the Good Neighbor Provision to\ndownwind air quality problems (of nonattainment or\nmaintenance) that are currently present and will continue into\nthe future. See id at 913\u201314.\n\n     North Carolina resolves the question presented here.\nSection 126(b) requires a finding on whether an emission\ncauses a violation of the Good Neighbor Provision. And an\nupwind source that currently contributes to downwind air\nquality problems, but that will not contribute to these problems\nin the future, does not cause such a violation. Thus, in its Step\nOne analysis, the EPA permissibly excluded downwind areas\nthat are not currently attaining the NAAQS but that will reach\nattainment by a relevant future date.\n\n    The Petitioners press four counterarguments. First, they\ncontend that the EPA\u2019s approach of requiring future\nnonattainment is inconsistent with inclusion of the present\ntense in section 126(b), which covers any major source that\n\u201cemits or would emit\u201d a pollutant in violation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision. But to violate the Good Neighbor\nProvision, as the EPA has permissibly construed it, the source\nmust contribute to both current and future downwind\nnonattainment. See id. at 914. And if no such violation will\nmaterialize, then the fact of current nonattainment is irrelevant.\n\f                               30\n     The Petitioners suggest that the word \u201cwill\u201d must take on\na different meaning as incorporated into section 126(b) than it\ndoes in the Good Neighbor Provision itself, lest the present-\ntense \u201cemits\u201d be entirely collapsed into the future conditional\n\u201cwould emit.\u201d But statutes are not chameleons, acquiring\ndifferent meanings when presented in different contexts. See\nClark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 382 (2005). If present-only\nnonattainment does not trigger a violation of the Good\nNeighbor provision, then it cannot trigger a violation of that\nsame provision as incorporated into section 126(b).\n\n     In any event, the EPA\u2019s interpretation does not turn\n\u201cemits\u201d into surplusage. Sometimes, current emissions do\ncontribute to future nonattainment. For example, the EPA\nevaluates attainment of ozone standards based on certain\nconcentrations averaged over three consecutive years. See\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456.\nThus, to predict air quality for 2023, the EPA looks to actual or\npredicted air quality between 2020 and 2022. So a source that\npollutes right now, in 2020, \u201cemits\u201d pollutants that \u201cwill\ncontribute\u201d to pollution levels\u2014and possibly nonattainment\u2014\nfor 2023. That gives \u201cemits\u201d independent meaning.\n\n     Second, the Petitioners argue that North Carolina itself\nrejected the EPA\u2019s current reading of section 126(b). After\nholding that the EPA could permissibly construe the Good\nNeighbor Provision as focused on future nonattainment, we\nstated that this \u201cdoes not mean that EPA may ignore present-\nday violations for which there may be another remedy, such as\nrelief pursuant to section 126.\u201d 531 F.3d at 914. But North\nCarolina presented no question involving section 126, so our\nstatement about it was dictum. As a consequence, we had no\noccasion to substantively address this interpretive question.\n\f                               31\n     Third, the Petitioner-Intervenors contend that the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation disregards the accelerated enforcement deadlines\nin section 126. Under the Good Neighbor Provision,\nimplementation plans must ensure that upwind states do not\ncontribute significantly to downwind nonattainment at the next\nfuture downwind deadline. See Wisconsin, 938 F.3d at 313\u2013\n20. Those deadlines can be three to twenty years in the future.\nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1). In contrast, section 126 gives\nupwind sources only three months, extendable to three years,\nto eliminate significant contributions after the EPA finds a\nviolation of the Good Neighbor Provision. Id. \u00a7 7426(c). The\npetitioner-intervenors argue that this shortened enforcement\nhorizon reflects heightened concern with current\nnonattainment. They are right that section 126(b) provides for\nfast remediation, but what is remediated must nonetheless be a\nviolation of the Good Neighbor Provision. And as we have\nexplained, its scope does not change depending on whether\nenforcement is sought under section 126(b). See Appalachian\nPower Co., 249 F.3d at 1047.\n\n     Fourth, the Citizen Petitioners invoke a past section 126(b)\nfinding that they say turns entirely on current nonattainment.\nIn 2011, the EPA granted New Jersey\u2019s petition regarding\nsulfur dioxide emissions from a nearby Pennsylvania power\nplant. See Final Response to Petition from New Jersey\nRegarding SO2 Emissions from the Portland Generating\nStation, 76 Fed. Reg. 69,052, 69,053 (Nov. 7, 2011). Although\nthe EPA had promulgated a sulfur dioxide NAAQS in 2010, it\nhad not yet set future attainment deadlines. But the agency\nnonetheless granted the petition because the power plant was\nsignificantly contributing to current nonattainment. See id. at\n69,053, 69,058.\n\n   The Citizen Petitioners are mistaken to suggest that the\nEPA\u2019s present position is inconsistent with agency precedent.\n\f                             32\nFor several decades, the EPA has consistently interpreted the\nGood Neighbor Provision to require future nonattainment. See\nClose-Out Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 65,889 (discussing past agency\nactions), vacated on other grounds, New York, 781 F. App\u2019x at\n4. The agency\u2019s treatment of New Jersey\u2019s petition fit that\npattern. Downwind sulfur dioxide pollution is usually caused\nby one or a few nearby sources. See Data Requirements Rule\nfor the 2010 1-Hour Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Primary National\nAmbient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), 80 Fed. Reg. 51,052,\n51,057 (Aug. 21, 2015). In the case of the Pennsylvania plant,\nactual emissions were causing pollution levels more than two\ntimes greater than the applicable NAAQS, and otherwise\nallowable emissions would have caused pollution levels more\nthan seven times greater. See Response to Petition from New\nJersey Regarding SO2 Emissions from the Portland Generating\nStation, 76 Fed. Reg. 19,662, 19,668, 19,672 (Apr. 7, 2011).\nBecause a single source was causing New Jersey to exceed the\nNAAQS by a wide margin, the EPA could reasonably have\nconcluded that, absent intervention, New Jersey\u2019s current\nnonattainment would persist into the future.\n\n     No such extrapolation would be reliable for ozone. Ozone\nprecursors are transported over long distances, so downwind\nozone problems often are caused by numerous upwind sources.\nSee EME Homer City., 572 U.S. at 496\u201397. And ozone\nconcentrations can be significantly affected by meteorological\nvariables. See Findings of Significant Contribution and\nRulemaking on Section 126 Petitions for Purposes of Reducing\nInterstate Ozone Transportation, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,250, 28,292\n(May 25, 1999). All of this makes predicting future levels for\nozone far more complex than doing so for sulfur dioxide. See\nMichigan v. EPA, 213 F.3d 663, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (per\ncuriam). The New Jersey finding thus does nothing to\nundermine the EPA\u2019s position in this case.\n\f                               33\n    2. Future Nonattainment\n\n    The Petitioners next argue that, looking to the future, the\nEPA was required to measure air quality in the year that\ncorresponds with the next applicable downwind attainment\ndeadline. We agree.\n\n      The Good Neighbor Provision requires upwind states to\neliminate excess emissions \u201cconsistent with\u201d Title I of the\nClean Air Act, which includes the deadlines for downwind\nstates to attain the ozone standards.           See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i). As we recently explained in Wisconsin, an\nimplementation plan violates the Good Neighbor Provision if\nit fails to \u201celiminate upwind States\u2019 significant contributions to\ndownwind pollution by the statutory deadline for downwind\nStates to meet the NAAQS for ozone.\u201d 938 F.3d at 314.\nBecause section 126(b) incorporates the Good Neighbor\nProvision, the EPA must find a violation if an upwind source\nwill significantly contribute to downwind nonattainment at the\nnext downwind attainment deadline. Therefore, the agency\nmust evaluate downwind air quality at that deadline, not at\nsome later date.\n\n     In this case, Delaware\u2019s next attainment deadline under the\n2015 ozone NAAQS is the deadline for marginal\nnonattainment areas, which falls in 2021. See supra at 16 &\nn.5. Yet when conducting its analysis of Delaware\u2019s petitions\nat Step One, the EPA chose to examine the State\u2019s air quality\nin 2023. This decision cannot be reconciled with the Good\nNeighbor Provision as we construed it in Wisconsin.\n\n     The EPA\u2019s responses are unpersuasive. It argues that\nmarginal nonattainment areas often achieve the NAAQS\nwithout further downwind reductions, so it would be\nunreasonable to impose reductions on upwind sources based on\nthe next marginal attainment deadline. Nonetheless, Delaware\n\f                              34\nmust achieve attainment \u201cas expeditiously as practicable but\nnot later than\u201d 2021, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1), so upwind\nsources violate the Good Neighbor Provision if they will\nsignificantly contribute to Delaware\u2019s failure to meet that\ndeadline. See Wisconsin, 938 F.3d at 314. The EPA adds that\nif Delaware\u2019s marginal area fails to reach attainment by 2021,\nit will be automatically bumped up to a moderate\nnonattainment status and then subjected to a 2024 deadline.\nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2). But that does not make\nDelaware\u2019s obligation to attain the NAAQS by 2021 any less\nbinding. And an upgrade from a marginal to a moderate\nnonattainment area carries significant consequences, such as a\nrequirement to provide for annual emissions reductions in SIPs.\nSee id. \u00a7 7511a(b). So long as upwind sources significantly\ncontribute to Delaware\u2019s nonattainment at its 2021 attainment\ndeadline, they violate the Good Neighbor Provision.\n\nD. Whether Delaware Carried Its Burden\n\n     In sum, here is the basic legal framework for analysis of\nDelaware\u2019s section 126(b) petitions at Step One. First,\nDelaware bore the burden to prove a violation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision. Second, the EPA was required to consider\ndata from out-of-state receptors in the Philadelphia-\nWilmington-Atlantic City Attainment Area, which includes\nparts of Delaware. Third, the EPA was not required to consider\ndownwind areas reflecting only current nonattainment, but it\nwas required to consider areas reflecting nonattainment both\ncurrently and at the next attainment deadline. Applying these\nrules, we conclude that the EPA\u2019s decision to reject Delaware\u2019s\npetitions at Step One was arbitrary with respect to petitions\nunder the 2008 ozone standards, but not with respect to\npetitions under the 2015 ozone standards.\n\f                               35\n    1. 2008 NAAQS\n\n     In its petitions under the 2008 NAAQS, Delaware failed to\nidentify any receptor connected to the State showing current or\nfuture nonattainment.        See Response to Delaware and\nMaryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456. The petitions simply noted\nthe number of days that air pollution levels in the State had\nexceeded the NAAQS. See Del. Conemaugh Pet. at 3 (J.A.\n160); Del. Homer City Pet. at 3(J.A. 193); Del. Brunner Island\nPet. at 3 (J.A. 221); Del. Harrison Pet. at 3 (J.A. 248). But the\nEPA measures nonattainment based on the fourth-highest daily\nmaximum ozone concentration, averaged across three\nconsecutive years. See Response to Delaware and Maryland,\n83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456. Delaware\u2019s petitions failed to provide\nthat information and thus failed to carry the State\u2019s burden of\nproof at Step One.\n\n     Delaware provided additional information in its comments\nresponding to the EPA\u2019s proposed denial of its petitions. 9\nSpecifically, it highlighted data from a receptor in Bristol,\nPennsylvania that was part of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-\nAtlantic City attainment area. The EPA declined to consider\nthis data because it came from an out-of-state receptor. See\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456.\nAs explained above, that decision was arbitrary and capricious.\nThe EPA makes no suggestion that, had it considered data from\nthe Bristol receptor, it still might have concluded that Delaware\nfailed to carry its burden at Step One. We therefore hold that\nDelaware carried its burden.\n\n\n\n\n    9\n        The EPA has not argued that Delaware forfeited reliance on\nthis information by failing to offer it in its petitions.\n\f                               36\n    2. 2015 NAAQS\n\n     In its petitions under the 2015 NAAQS, Delaware also\nfailed to provide data showing any current or future\nnonattainment. In its comments on the EPA\u2019s proposed denial,\nDelaware showed current nonattainment at both the Bristol\nmonitor and an in-state monitor in New Castle. Del. Cmts. at\n4, 10 (J.A. 345, 351). But Delaware offered no data showing\nnonattainment at either monitor in 2021, the deadline for both\nareas under the 2015 NAAQS. Id. at 4, 10 (J.A. 345, 351).\nBecause Delaware failed to show that upwind sources will\nsignificantly contribute to nonattainment at its next future\ndeadline, it failed to carry its Step One burden. See Wisconsin,\n938 F.3d at 314.\n\n     After rejecting Delaware\u2019s petitions on this ground, the\nEPA went on to conduct its own independent analysis of future\nattainment, which erroneously considered pollution levels in\n2023 rather than 2021. But because the EPA independently\nrested its decision on Delaware\u2019s failure to carry its burden of\nproof, the agency\u2019s error on this point was harmless.\n\n         III. Denial of All Petitions at Step Three\n\n     Having concluded our review at Step One of the EPA\u2019s\nGood Neighbor framework, we proceed to Step Three: the\nidentification of cost-effective reductions at the named sources.\nOn this front, the parties have separate disputes with respect to\nthe sources that have catalytic controls; the sources that have\nnon-catalytic controls; and the one facility, Brunner Island,\nwith neither. We take each in turn.\n\nA. Catalytic Controls\n\n    Delaware\u2019s three petitions not related to Brunner Island\ninvolve sources that, the State claims, are failing to optimize\n\f                               37\ntheir catalytic controls. Similarly, thirty-two out of the thirty-\nsix sources in Maryland\u2019s petition have catalytic controls that\nthe State says they are failing to optimize. The EPA concluded\nin the Update Rule that such optimization is a cost-effective\nstrategy for reducing NOx emissions. This, Petitioners say, is\nmore or less the ball game. If optimization is the measure of\nGood Neighbor compliance, and if the named sources are\nfailing to optimize, then it necessarily follows that those\nsources are not currently in compliance with the Good\nNeighbor Provision.\n\n     The EPA offered two answers in its denial. First, it said,\nthe latest data showed that \u201cthe control optimization and the\nemission reductions anticipated from the [Update Rule] are\nbeing realized from the 34 units with [catalytic controls].\u201d\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,465\n(emphasis added). Second, it explained, \u201ceven in the event of\nany single-unit variation in performance, the overall reductions\n[attributable to optimization] are occurring within the same\nairshed due to the fact that state budgets and assurance levels\nwere set to ensure those reduction levels statewide and\nregionwide\u201d through the Update Rule\u2019s trading program. Id. at\n50,466. In other words, the logic of a cap-and-trade program\nis that not all sources will reduce their individual emissions to\nthe same extent. We uphold the EPA\u2019s first answer as\nreasonable and do not address the second.\n\n     The parties disagree about how to tell if any given source\nis optimizing its controls. (No one has knocked on the plants\u2019\ndoors to see for themselves.) How high do a source\u2019s emissions\nneed to be before we can conclude that it is failing to optimize?\nFor purposes of the Update Rule, the EPA concluded that\noptimizing catalytic controls would result in an average NOx\nemissions rate of 0.10 lb/mmBtu. Update Rule, 81 Fed. Reg.\nat 74,543. That figure was based on the third-best average\n\f                                 38\nperformance of the covered sources between 2009 and 2015, a\nchoice we upheld in Wisconsin over the objection that the EPA\nshould have chosen an even lower figure. 938 F.3d at 320\u201321.\n\n     Now suppose a source is found emitting above the EPA\u2019s\nestimated average\u2014at 0.11 lb/mmBtu, for instance\u2014after the\nUpdate Rule. Is the source failing to optimize? Petitioners\nseem to think so. See, e.g., Md Br. 29; Citizen Pet\u2019rs Br. 16\u2013\n17; Pet\u2019r-Intervenors Br. 46\u201347. But the EPA explains why\nthat may not be so:\n\n     The optimized rate for any particular unit depends on\n     the unit-specific characteristics, such as boiler\n     configuration, burner type and configuration, fuel\n     type, capacity factor, and control characteristics such\n     as the age, type, and number of layers of catalyst and\n     reagent concentration and type.\n\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,466\nn.62. As a result, the bare fact that a source emits above 0.10\nlb/mmBtu is equivocal. It could be evidence that the source is\nnot optimizing, or it could be evidence that that particular\nsource\u2019s optimized rate is higher than average.\n\n    In that light, the EPA approached the question from the\nopposite direction: What sorts of rates are likely to result if a\nsource does not consistently operate its catalytic controls? The\nagency pegged that figure at 0.20 lb/mmBtu, a rate that sources\ncan usually hit by operating only their combustion controls.\nSee id.10 And as the agency observed, virtually all of the\n\n     10\n         Of course, any threshold the agency chose would present a\ntrade-off. Short of determining each source\u2019s true optimized rate, an\nundertaking in some tension with the general principle that section\n126 allocates the initial evidentiary burden to Petitioners, see supra\nPart II.A, the EPA could not avoid either under- or over-inclusion.\n\f                                39\nsources equipped with catalytic controls nationwide beat that\nmark in 2017, after the Update Rule went into effect,\n\u201cincluding every unit with [catalytic controls] named in\nDelaware\u2019s and Maryland\u2019s petitions.\u201d Id. at 50,466. The\nremaining few either achieved as much based on preliminary\n2018 data, are not located in the states targeted by the petitions,\nor have since retired. See id.\n\n     Maryland and Citizen Petitioners do not respond directly\nto the EPA\u2019s explanation for applying a 0.20 lb/mmBtu rule of\nthumb, as opposed to the 0.10 lb/mmBtu average it articulated\nin the Update Rule. But they mount a further argument that\nthese particular sources are not achieving their individual\noptimized rates because they have performed more efficiently\nin the past. In particular, the Petitioners calculated the \u201chighest\n30-day rolling average rate of emissions experienced by [each]\nsource during its best ozone season,\u201d Md. Br. 23, and argue that\nthe EPA should have required sources to match that\nperformance. The trouble with this argument is that it mirrors\none we rejected in Wisconsin. There, in choosing to look to\neach source\u2019s third-best ozone season for purposes of the\nUpdate Rule, the EPA explained that sources\u2019 very best rates\nare not, in the main, consistently achievable. See Wisconsin,\n938 F.3d at 320\u201321; Update Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 74,544.\nHaving found EPA\u2019s reasoning on that question reasonable\nonce, we do so again here.\n\n     Delaware\u2019s objection is somewhat different. The State\nacknowledges EPA\u2019s use of the 0.20 lb/mmBtu threshold, but\npoints out that some of the named sources emitted above that\nmark on individual days of the ozone season. See Del. Br. 30\u2013\n31. Since the EPA bases attainment on daily concentrations,\nnot seasonal emissions, Delaware argues that the EPA should\nlikewise control daily emissions to avoid the possibility that\nsources will idle their controls on days with high electricity\n\f                                40\ndemand. We did not have the occasion to consider the Update\nRule\u2019s reliance on a seasonal cap in Wisconsin, since no party\nchallenged that decision there. But as the EPA explained here,\nthere appears to be \u201cvery little difference\u201d between \u201cNOx rates\nfor EGUs for hours with high energy demand\u201d and \u201cseasonal\naverage NOx rates.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,466. In other words, Delaware\u2019s concern\nmakes sense but has not been observed in practice. The EPA\nalso noted that there may be valid operational reasons not to\noperate catalytic controls on particular days, \u201ce.g., to avoid\ndamaging or plugging of the [control] or taking a forced outage\nwhere a breakdown leaves the unit unavailable to produce\npower.\u201d Id. at 50,466-67. As a result, that a source ends up\nemitting above 0.20 lb/mmBtu on a particular day is not\nnecessarily evidence of a failure to optimize. The EPA\u2019s\nexplanation was reasonable. 11\n\nB. Non-Catalytic Controls\n\n     We now turn to the next control strategy at issue.\nMaryland contends that the four electric generating units in its\npetition that do not have catalytic controls should be required\nto operate their non-catalytic controls. Maryland argues that\nthe EPA cannot rely on the Update Rule\u2019s conclusion that such\ncontrols are not cost-effective in light of our decision in\nWisconsin. We agree, and because we do not read the denial\n\n    11\n         Maryland argues, relatedly, that the Clean Air Act itself\nrequires daily limits\u2014that a seasonal cap is not a valid \u201cemission\nlimitation\u201d within the meaning of the statute because it does not\n\u201climit[] the quantity, rate, or concentration of emissions of air\npollutants on a continuous basis.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(k). But\nMaryland did not present this interpretive claim in its comments; it\nsaid only that daily limits would be a good idea. See Md. Reply Br.\n6 (citing Md. Cmts. at 6, 11, 39, 45 (J.A. 290, 295, 323, 329)). The\nargument is therefore forfeited. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B).\n\f                               41\nto have offered an adequate argument in the alternative, we\nremand it to the agency with respect to this issue.\n\n     The EPA explained concisely its conclusion that operating\nnon-catalytic controls at these sources would not be cost-\neffective. The Update Rule, the agency said, had already\nconcluded as much on a regional level. See Response to\nDelaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,469\u201370. And there\nwas no reason to think these sources were any different, it\ncontinued, because the units identified \u201care relatively small in\nsize and have low emission levels, indicating that the units have\na relatively limited ability to substantially reduce NOx\nemissions.\u201d Id. at 50,470.\n\n     We cannot endorse this explanation after Wisconsin.\nThere, we concluded that the Update Rule was impermissibly\n\u201cpartial.\u201d Wisconsin, 938 F.3d at 318. As relevant here, in\nchoosing a cost-effectiveness threshold, the Update Rule did\nnot consider control strategies that could not have been\nimplemented in time for the 2017 ozone season. Id. at 313. As\nthe EPA concedes, the agency\u2019s judgment about the cost-\neffectiveness of non-catalytic controls may change when it\nconducts a new comparative analysis in response to the\nWisconsin remand. See Recording of Oral Arg. at 35:06;\naccord Close-Out Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 65,898\n(acknowledging that the EPA could have revisited the Update\nRule\u2019s conclusion about non-catalytic controls in the Close-\nOut Rule if it had found a continuing air quality problem). In\nthat light, the EPA cannot rely mechanically on the Update\nRule for the proposition that non-catalytic controls are not cost-\neffective. And the denial does not seriously suggest that its\nbrief discussion of these particular units amounted to a\nstandalone cost-effectiveness analysis. See EPA Br. 78\n(suggesting only that the EPA \u201creviewed the specific emissions\n\f                                42\nlevels of the named sources to determine if anything had\nchanged\u201d since the Update Rule was promulgated).\n\n     We recognize that Wisconsin does not imply that non-\ncatalytic controls are cost-effective\u2014or even that the EPA, on\nremand, will choose a different cost threshold than the one it\noriginally did.12 Indeed, Counsel suggested at argument that\nthe EPA\u2019s judgment about non-catalytic controls \u201cprobably\u201d\nwould not change. See Recording of Oral Arg. at 52:29. But\nunder the familiar rule of SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80\n(1943), we must review an agency\u2019s action on the basis of\nreasons it actually gave, not ones it hypothetically could. And\nwhile there are gestures in the denial at an alternative argument\nthat Petitioners bear the burden to establish that a control is\ncost-effective at Step Three (and failed to do so here), the EPA\nultimately based its decision on its own conclusion that non-\ncatalytic controls are not cost-effective. In that light, we need\nnot decide what burden a petitioner may have to show cost-\neffectiveness. 13\n\nC. Brunner Island\n\n     Finally, we address Delaware\u2019s Brunner Island petition.\nBrunner Island, which has installed neither catalytic nor non-\ncatalytic controls, added natural gas capacity to augment\u2014and\neventually replace\u2014its coal-firing generation units. Delaware\nargues that voluntary conversion is not enough and that the\nEPA must affirmatively prohibit the facility from burning coal.\n\n    12\n        Cf. Michigan, 213 F.3d at 680 (noting that EPA\u2019s \u201cselection\nof the cut-off point [is] essentially unbounded,\u201d given the sense in\nwhich we have permitted the agency to consider cost-effectiveness).\n    13\n        Given the possible alternative rationales identified by the\nEPA, we do not vacate the denial. See Allied-Signal, Inc., v. U.S.\nNuclear Regulatory Comm\u2019n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C Cir. 1993).\n\f                               43\nThe EPA declined to impose the requested limitation,\nconcluding that Brunner Island had not violated its Good\nNeighbor obligations. The EPA\u2019s determination is reasonable.\n\n     Brunner Island significantly reduced its pollution footprint\nby operating primarily on natural gas during the 2017 ozone\nseason. Compared to the 2016 season, NOx emissions fell from\n3,765 tons to 877 tons, as the emissions rate declined from\n0.370 lb/mmBtu to 0.090 lb/mmBtu. See Response to\nDelaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,470\u201371. In other\nwords, consistent with Delaware\u2019s proposed control strategy,\nBrunner Island utilized its natural gas capabilities to achieve a\nlow NOx emissions rate during the 2017 ozone season.\nBecause Delaware did not identify any \u201cadditional feasible and\ncost-effective NOx emissions reductions,\u201d it could not\n\u201cdemonstrate that, at this current level of emissions, Brunner\nIsland emits in violation of\u201d the Good Neighbor Provision. Id.\nThe EPA next explained that favorable natural gas prices,\ncoupled with the incentive for Brunner Island to sell unused\nemissions allowances, supported its \u201cbelie[f that] Brunner\nIsland will continue to primarily use natural gas as fuel during\nfuture ozone seasons for economic reasons.\u201d Id. at 50,471.\nThus, Delaware\u2019s petition also failed to show that Brunner\nIsland \u201cwould emit\u201d in violation of the Good Neighbor\nProvision.\n\n    According to Delaware, the installation of a NOx control\ntechnology does not, by itself, prevent a future violation of the\nGood Neighbor Provision. Rather, a corresponding regulatory\nrequirement is necessary to ensure optimal operation and, on\nthis front, \u201cpassive market forces are an unacceptable\nemissions limitation under the [Clean Air] Act.\u201d Del. Br. 34.\nDelaware asserts that the EPA, by crediting Brunner Island\u2019s\nvoluntary choice to burn natural gas, contravened section\n126(c)\u2019s instruction that a violating source may continue\n\f                                44\noperating only if it \u201ccomplies with such emission limitations\n. . . as may be provided by the Administrator.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7426(c) (emphasis added). As Delaware sees it, the EPA\nmust affirmatively ensure that Brunner Island maintains its\nNOx reductions in the future. But section 126(c) contemplates\nEPA-mandated limitations only for \u201ca source referred to in\nparagraph (2),\u201d id., that is, \u201cany major existing source . . . after\nsuch finding has been made with respect to it,\u201d id. \u00a7 7426(c)(2).\nAnd because the requisite finding is one \u201cmade under\nsubsection (b),\u201d id. \u00a7 7426(c)(1), the imposition of limitations\nunder section 126(c) is therefore predicated on finding, under\nsection 126(b), that a source \u201cemits or would emit\u201d in violation\nof the Good Neighbor Provision, id. \u00a7 7426(b). Put differently,\nthe remedies to cure a Good Neighbor violation are distinct\nfrom whether a violation has occurred in the first place. See\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,472\n(\u201c[T]he EPA only implements federally enforceable limits\nunder step four of the four-step framework for sources that the\nEPA determines have emissions that significantly contribute to\nnonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the ozone\nNAAQS downwind under steps one, two, and three.\u201d). The\nEPA determined that Brunner Island does not, and would not,\nemit in violation of the Good Neighbor Provision.\nAccordingly, it was not required to issue federally enforceable\nlimitations under the Clean Air Act.\n\n     Petitioner-Intervenors dispute the EPA\u2019s Good Neighbor\ndetermination, alleging that Brunner Island could, at any time,\nrevert to burning coal which, considering its 2016 NOx\nemissions rate of 0.370 lb/mmBtu, proves it \u201cwould emit\u201d in\nviolation of the Good Neighbor Provision. See Pet\u2019r-\nIntervenors Br. 48. The EPA concluded such a reversion was\nunlikely, considering Brunner Island\u2019s strategic decision to\ninvest in natural gas, the economic incentive to burn natural gas\nand sell unused emission allowances through the NOx trading\n\f                              45\nprogram, and price projections indicating that natural gas will\nremain a less expensive fuel source. See Response to Delaware\nand Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,471. The EPA also noted\nthat, pursuant to a settlement agreement, Brunner Island\u2019s\nowner \u201cagree[d] to operate only on natural gas during the ozone\nseason . . . starting on January 1, 2023, . . . and cease coal\noperations after December 31, 2028.\u201d Id. at 50,471 n.79.\nPetitioner-Intervenors offer no evidence contradicting the\nEPA\u2019s record determination beyond unsupported conjecture\nthat Brunner Island could decide to burn coal.\n\n     Moreover, Delaware and Petitioner-Intervenors provide\nno reason that the EPA could not consider all known conditions\naffecting Brunner Island\u2019s anticipated emissions. \u201cOur review\nunder the \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 standard is narrow and\ndoes not permit us to substitute our policy judgment for that of\nthe Agency.\u201d Bluewater Network v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1, 11 (D.C.\nCir. 2004). \u201cThus, when an agency\u2019s decision is primarily\npredictive, our role is limited; we require only that the agency\nacknowledge factual uncertainties and identify the\nconsiderations it found persuasive.\u201d Rural Cellular Ass\u2019n v.\nFCC, 588 F.3d 1095, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Here, the EPA\ndiscussed the economic incentives built into the cap-and-trade\nprogram, outlined Brunner Island\u2019s business strategy and\nhighlighted natural gas price projections prepared by\nindependent analysts.        See Response to Delaware and\nMaryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,471. And it acknowledged the\nfallibility of its predictions, conceding that \u201cBrunner Island\u2019s\noperations [could] change such that the facility is operating\nprimarily on coal during future ozone seasons.\u201d Id. at 50,472.\nIn that case, if \u201cfuture emission levels increase,\u201d Delaware can\n\u201csubmit[] another petition regarding Brunner Island\u2019s\nimpacts.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we find that the EPA reasonably\nexplained its predictive judgment.\n\f                               46\n       IV. Nonconsideration of Maryland\u2019s Petition\n                 Under 2015 NAAQS\n\n     Finally, Maryland argues that the EPA\u2019s refusal to\nevaluate its petition under the 2015 ozone NAAQS was\narbitrary and capricious. We disagree.\n\n     To preserve an issue for our review, a party generally must\nraise the issue before the agency. The Clean Air Act\nspecifically provides that issues must be raised during the\nperiod for public comment in order to be reviewable here. See\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). Likewise, general administrative-\nlaw principles require timely preservation of issues before the\nagency. See United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344\nU.S. 33, 37 (1952); Nuclear Energy Inst., Inc. v. EPA, 373 F.3d\n1251, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n     In this case, Maryland\u2019s section 126(b) petition did not ask\nthe EPA to make a finding that upwind sources were\nsignificantly contributing to its nonattainment of the 2015\nNAAQS. On the contrary, the petition sought a finding only\n\u201cwith respect to the 2008 ozone [NAAQS].\u201d Md. Cover Ltr. at\n1 (J.A. 48). Moreover, Maryland repeatedly described its\nemissions problem, its requested finding, and its proposed\nremedy by reference to the 2008 NAAQS. See Md. Pt. at 1, 3,\n4, 17 (J.A. 50, 52, 53, 66). Because Maryland did not ask for\na finding under the 2015 standards, the EPA permissibly\ndeclined to make one. See Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 251\nF.3d 1026, 1036 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\u201cAn agency cannot be\nfaulted for failing to address such issues that were not raised by\npetitioners.\u201d).\n\n    Maryland contends that its petition did request a finding\nunder the 2015 NAAQS, if not in so many words. Specifically,\nMaryland noted that a timely remedy might allow some in-state\nareas also to reach attainment under the 2015 standards. See\n\f                               47\nMd. Pet. at 9, 13, 14 (J.A. 58, 62, 63). But that does not amount\nto requesting a finding under those standards. Instead, it\nsuggests only that a finding under the 2008 standards might\nhave produced further in-state benefits under other standards.\n\n    Alternatively, Maryland responds that its petition did not\nneed to request a finding under the 2015 NAAQS. Maryland\nreasons that, when it filed the petition in November 2016, the\nEPA had not yet issued attainment designations for it under the\n2015 NAAQS. But whether it would have been premature for\nMaryland to request a finding under the 2015 standards at that\ntime is beside the point. In its November 2016 petition\u2014the\nonly one at issue here\u2014Maryland did not request a finding\nunder the 2015 standards. Now that the EPA has designated\nareas in Maryland as failing to attain those standards, the State\nremains free to file a separate petition requesting a finding\nunder them.\n\n     Finally, Maryland notes that it asked for a finding under\nthe 2015 standards in its comments to the EPA\u2019s proposed\ndenial of its petition. But that request came too late. Consistent\nwith Maryland\u2019s petition, the EPA\u2019s proposed action did not\naddress the 2015 standards and failed to give public notice that\nit might do so. See Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,463. With the proceeding so far along,\nMaryland could not properly request an entirely new finding.\nWe recognize that Maryland was required to preserve\narguments in its response to the proposed denial, 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B), but that hardly entitled it to raise points\nwholly outside the scope of the notice generated by its own\nprior petition. Because Maryland\u2019s request for a finding under\nthe 2015 NAAQS fell outside the scope of the pending\nrulemaking\u2014as triggered by Maryland\u2019s own petition\u2014the\nEPA had no obligation to address it. See Am. Fuel &\nPetrochemical Mfrs., 937 F.3d at 585\u201386.\n\f                             48\n                       V. Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we grant Maryland\u2019s petition\nfor review in part and remand the non-catalytic controls issue\nto the EPA.

At Step One, it identifies downwind\nareas projected to have trouble attaining the relevant air quality\nstandard. At Step Two, the EPA determines which upwind\nstates are \u201clinked\u201d to the downwind nonattainment sites. At\nStep Three, it calculates the optimal level of pollution control,\nconsidering the marginal cost of emission reductions and\nanticipated downwind air quality improvements. The EPA\nthen formulates an emissions budget for each state, accounting\nfor achievable reductions. Finally, at Step Four, the EPA\ntypically promulgates federal implementation plans that\nrequire upwind states\u2019 participation in a regional cap-and-trade\nprogram to bring about compliance with their Good Neighbor\nobligations.\n\n     Separately, Clean Air Act section 126(b) authorizes \u201c[a]ny\nState\u201d to petition the EPA for a finding that an upwind source\n\u201cemits or would emit\u201d in violation of the Good Neighbor\nProvision\u2019s prohibition.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> \u00a7 7426(b). </span><pre class=\"inline\">If the EPA makes the\nrequested finding, the offending source must cease operations\n\f                               4\nunless it complies with federally enforceable emission\nlimitations. In 2016 Maryland and Delaware filed section\n126(b) petitions requesting that the EPA impose additional\nlimitations on certain upwind sources that were purportedly\ncontributing to the two States\u2019 nonattainment of the national\nozone standards. Both States sought to require the optimization\nof existing selective catalytic reduction controls; Maryland also\naddressed the operation of selective non-catalytic reduction\ncontrols at two facilities and Delaware requested that one\nfacility burn only natural gas.\n\n     The EPA denied the petitions on October 5, 2018.\nBecause a section 126(b) petition seeks a finding that the\nupwind source has violated the Good Neighbor provision, the\nEPA applies the same four-step framework it developed in the\nimplementation of section 110. The EPA denied Delaware\u2019s\npetitions at Step One, finding that Delaware had not\ndemonstrated a current or future in-state air quality problem\nand that, under the EPA\u2019s own modeling, no such problem\nwould exist under either the 2008 or 2015 ozone standards.\nAlternatively, the EPA concluded that denial was warranted\nunder Step Three because Delaware failed to identify any\navailable cost-effective controls at the named sources.\nAlthough Maryland survived Steps One and Two, the EPA\ndenied its petition at Step Three. Like Delaware, Maryland\nfailed to identify further cost-effective emission reductions at\nsources operating with catalytic controls. For the remaining\nsources named in Maryland\u2019s petition, the EPA explained that\nnon-catalytic controls were not cost-effective in this context.\nMaryland, Delaware and a coalition of environmental groups\n(Citizen Petitioners) petition for review of the EPA\u2019s denials.\nAlthough we reject some of the EPA\u2019s Step One\ndeterminations, we find, with one exception, that it reasonably\ndenied the petitions at Step Three. We conclude, however, that\nthe EPA\u2019s explanation was inadequate with respect to non-\n\f                                   5\ncatalytic controls. We therefore grant Maryland\u2019s petition for\nreview in part and remand this issue to the EPA. We deny all\nother petitions for review.\n\n                           I. Background\n\nA.

Denial of Delaware\u2019s Petitions at Step One\n\n     The Petitioners first argue that the EPA arbitrarily denied\nDelaware\u2019s section 126(b) petitions at Step One. They assert\nthat the EPA impermissibly refused to consider data from an\nout-of-state receptor and data regarding nonattainment before\n2023. The EPA contests both points. In addition, it contends\n\f                                19\nthat, regardless of whether its own analysis was flawed,\nDelaware bore the burden of proof and failed to meet it.\n\nA. Burden of Proof\n\n     We first consider whether the EPA permissibly assigned\nthe burden of proof to Delaware. On this question of statutory\nconstruction, we ask only whether the EPA\u2019s position\nreasonably interprets the governing provisions of the Clean Air\nAct. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842\u201344\n(1984).\n\n    We begin with statutory text. Section 126(b) provides that\n\u201c[a]ny State or political subdivision may petition the\nAdministrator for a finding\u201d of a violation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b). Section 126(b)\nmakes clear that the petitioning state must initiate the process.\nAs a general \u201cdefault rule,\u201d the burden of proof falls \u201cupon the\nparty seeking relief.\u201d Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v.

And the provision of the Clean Air Act\ngoverning section 126(b) proceedings does nothing to displace\nthe default rule. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d). This strongly\nsuggests that the default rule should apply. See Astoria Fed.\nSav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v.

The Clean\nAir Act requires the EPA to resolve a section 126(b) petition\n\u201c[w]ithin 60 days after receipt . . . and after public hearing,\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b), though the EPA may extend the deadline to\nsix months,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 7607(d)(10). </span><pre class=\"inline\">In New York v.

This distinction makes little difference, for\nany evaluation under the Good Neighbor Provision requires\ntime-intensive research and analysis assessing air quality\nproblems in the petitioning downwind state, the cause of those\nproblems in upwind states, and the cost-effectiveness of\npossible solutions. As we explained in New York, these tasks\nare at odds with a sixty-day deadline. We therefore hold that\nthe EPA reasonably interpreted section 126(b) to require\nDelaware to bear the burden of proof.\n\nB. Consideration of Out-of-State Monitors\n\n     We now address the EPA\u2019s decision not to consider air\nquality data from non-attaining receptors outside Delaware,\n\u201ceven if such monitors are located in a multistate\nnonattainment area that includes [Delaware].\u201d Response to\nDelaware and Maryland, 83 Fed.

The EPA\nconstrues the \u201cpetition authority\u201d set out in section 126(b) as\n\u201climited to states and political subdivisions seeking to address\ninterstate transport of pollution impacting downwind receptors\nwithin their geographical borders.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509274\"> <a href=\"/opinion/509274/state-of-new-york-v-us-environmental-protection-agency-and-william/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added).\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\f                                 21\nDelaware and Petitioner-Intervenors assert that section 126(b)\nplainly authorizes Delaware to petition based on out-of-state\nmonitoring data or, alternatively, that the EPA\u2019s statutory\ninterpretation is unreasonable.\n\n     Again, we start with the text. See NRDC v.

Starting with the premise that \u201c[a]ny State\u201d\ncan file a section 126(b) petition, Delaware contends the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation conflicts with the statute\u2019s plain meaning\nbecause the text does not \u201cexplicitly bar[] a state from\npetitioning EPA for a finding that a source is affecting\ndownwind receptors in another state.\u201d Del.

First, other\nClean Air Act provisions \u201cthat contain petition authority . . .\nexpressly allow for any person to petition the EPA\u201d whereas\nsection 126(b) is limited to states and political subdivisions.\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,460\n(emphasis added); see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7661d(b)(2). But this\nobservation has little bearing on the question before us. \u201cAny\nState\u201d plainly includes Delaware and the fact that the section\n126(b) petition process is comparatively circumscribed does\nnot mean an otherwise qualified petitioner is thereafter subject\nto additional, implicit limitations. Next, the EPA contends that\n\u201cthe context of . . . section 126 as a whole suggests these\nprovisions are meant to moderate interstate transport concerns\n\f                               23\nbetween affected states and upwind sources, not between any\nthird party (even if such party is another state) and upwind\nsources.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg.\nat 50,460 (emphasis added). For example, section 126(a)\nrequires certain upwind sources \u201cto provide written notice to\nall nearby States the air pollution levels of which may be\naffected by such source.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1). The EPA\nimports this language into section 126(b), reading in a\nrequirement that the petitioning state be \u201cdirectly affected by\nupwind pollution.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,460 (emphasis added). And, according to the\nEPA, Delaware is not \u201caffected\u201d because it has provided no\nevidence of an in-state air quality problem.\n\n     The EPA\u2019s position is unavailing. Although Congress, in\nsection 126(a), referred specifically to \u201cStates . . . which may\nbe affected by such [upwind] source,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1),\nit included no analogous limitation in section 126(b).\nMoreover, it is not at all obvious when a state is \u201caffected.\u201d\nIndeed, section 126(a) requires a new or modified source to\nprovide written notice if it \u201cmay significantly contribute to\nlevels of air pollution in excess of the [NAAQS] in any air\nquality control region outside\u201d the source\u2019s own state.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\u00a7 7426(a)(1)(B). </span><pre class=\"inline\">Because \u201cair quality control regions\u201d include\nmultistate areas,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 7407(b)(1), </span><pre class=\"inline\">(c), it is unclear whether all\nstates in a shared nonattainment area are \u201caffected\u201d\u2014and are\ntherefore owed written notice\u2014regardless of where in the\nmultistate area the offending air pollution is measured. Thus,\neven accepting the EPA\u2019s proffered interpretation\u2014that only\naffected states may file section 126(b) petitions to protect\nagainst violating upwind sources\u2014the same ambiguity arises.\n\n     Although statutory context, on its own, does not resolve\nmatters, the EPA also found that \u201cthe legislative history for\n[section 126(b)] suggests the provision was meant to address\n\f                                 24\nadverse air impacts only in the petitioning state.\u201d Response to\nDelaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,460. Its brief foray\ninto the legislative history is, at best, unilluminating. It relies\nsolely on the Conference Report accompanying the Clean Air\nAct Amendments of 1977, which added section 126. The\nSenate\u2019s proposed amendment is described in the Report as\ncabining section 126(b)\u2019s petition authority to findings that an\nupwind source \u201cadversely affect[s] the air quality in the\npetitioning State.\u201d H.R.

We\nagree.\n\n     The untenability of the EPA\u2019s interpretation is clear when\nwe consider its practical effect on the section 126(b) petition\nprocess. Section 126(b) permits downwind states to petition\nfor a finding that an upwind source is violating the Good\nNeighbor Provision, which prohibits emissions that will\n\u201ccontribute significantly to nonattainment in . . . any other\nState.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). There is no dispute\nthat Delaware could file a section 126(b) petition to address an\nupwind source\u2019s contribution to an in-state non-attaining\nreceptor. But, according to the EPA, Delaware has no recourse\nif its regulatory burden is attributable to a monitor in\nPennsylvania, even though Delaware remains bound by the\ncorresponding nonattainment designation. And, because\nDelaware cannot compel another state to file a section 126(b)\npetition, it is stuck in regulatory limbo, affected by an upwind\nsource yet unable to avail itself of the intended remedy for\naddressing upwind contributions to nonattainment.\n\n     The EPA\u2019s efforts to explain away this incongruity fall\nflat. First, the EPA contends that \u201cconcerns about the impacts\nof upwind pollution on out-of-state monitors in a shared\nmultistate nonattainment area . . . can be addressed under other\nstatutory processes.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,460. But the Clean Air Act creates the section\n126(b) petition process as an alternative to the use of\nimplementation plans. See supra at 8. Indeed, with respect to\nthe requirements of the Good Neighbor Provision and section\n126, \u201cthe EPA has consistently acknowledged that Congress\ncreated these provisions as two independent statutory processes\nto address the problem of interstate pollution transport.\u201d\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed.

To equalize the\nburdens between upwind and downwind states, the Clean Air\nAct authorizes a state to petition the EPA for a finding that\nupwind emissions significantly contribute to that state\u2019s\nnonattainment of the ozone NAAQS. But, under the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation, a state cannot file a section 126(b) petition if its\nnonattainment status is caused by a receptor outside its political\nboundaries, even as the state remains burdened by the\ncorresponding regulatory obligations. It is arbitrary for the\nEPA to subject states like Delaware to this burden while\ndenying access to the intended remedy. Cf.

Selection of Year to Measure Air Quality\n\n     We next consider a question of timing: In evaluating a\nsection 126(b) petition at Step One, for what year must the EPA\nassess nonattainment in the downwind state? The Petitioners\nargue that the EPA must focus on current nonattainment or, at\na minimum, nonattainment at the next future attainment\ndeadline applicable to the petitioning downwind state. We\ndisagree with the Petitioners on the first point, but we agree\nwith them on the second.\n\n    1. Current Nonattainment\n\n     The Petitioners contend that current nonattainment is\nenough to satisfy Step One. The EPA responds that section\n126(b), like the Good Neighbor Provision, concerns only\nnonattainment that will last into the future. Again, the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute is reasonable.\n\n     Section 126(b) requires a finding on whether an upwind\nsource \u201cemits or would emit\u201d a pollutant in violation of the\nGood Neighbor Provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b).

See id at 913\u201314.\n\n     North Carolina resolves the question presented here.\nSection 126(b) requires a finding on whether an emission\ncauses a violation of the Good Neighbor Provision. And an\nupwind source that currently contributes to downwind air\nquality problems, but that will not contribute to these problems\nin the future, does not cause such a violation. Thus, in its Step\nOne analysis, the EPA permissibly excluded downwind areas\nthat are not currently attaining the NAAQS but that will reach\nattainment by a relevant future date.\n\n    The Petitioners press four counterarguments. First, they\ncontend that the EPA\u2019s approach of requiring future\nnonattainment is inconsistent with inclusion of the present\ntense in section 126(b), which covers any major source that\n\u201cemits or would emit\u201d a pollutant in violation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision. But to violate the Good Neighbor\nProvision, as the EPA has permissibly construed it, the source\nmust contribute to both current and future downwind\nnonattainment. See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 914. </span><pre class=\"inline\">And if no such violation will\nmaterialize, then the fact of current nonattainment is irrelevant.\n\f                               30\n     The Petitioners suggest that the word \u201cwill\u201d must take on\na different meaning as incorporated into section 126(b) than it\ndoes in the Good Neighbor Provision itself, lest the present-\ntense \u201cemits\u201d be entirely collapsed into the future conditional\n\u201cwould emit.\u201d But statutes are not chameleons, acquiring\ndifferent meanings when presented in different contexts. See\nClark v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382 (2005). If present-only\nnonattainment does not trigger a violation of the Good\nNeighbor provision, then it cannot trigger a violation of that\nsame provision as incorporated into section 126(b).\n\n     In any event, the EPA\u2019s interpretation does not turn\n\u201cemits\u201d into surplusage. Sometimes, current emissions do\ncontribute to future nonattainment. For example, the EPA\nevaluates attainment of ozone standards based on certain\nconcentrations averaged over three consecutive years. See\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456.\nThus, to predict air quality for 2023, the EPA looks to actual or\npredicted air quality between 2020 and 2022. So a source that\npollutes right now, in 2020, \u201cemits\u201d pollutants that \u201cwill\ncontribute\u201d to pollution levels\u2014and possibly nonattainment\u2014\nfor 2023. That gives \u201cemits\u201d independent meaning.\n\n     Second, the Petitioners argue that North Carolina itself\nrejected the EPA\u2019s current reading of section 126(b). After\nholding that the EPA could permissibly construe the Good\nNeighbor Provision as focused on future nonattainment, we\nstated that this \u201cdoes not mean that EPA may ignore present-\nday violations for which there may be another remedy, such as\nrelief pursuant to section </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187265\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">126.\u201d</span> <a href=\"/opinion/187265/north-carolina-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

As a consequence, we had no\noccasion to substantively address this interpretive question.\n\f                               31\n     Third, the Petitioner-Intervenors contend that the EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation disregards the accelerated enforcement deadlines\nin section 126. Under the Good Neighbor Provision,\nimplementation plans must ensure that upwind states do not\ncontribute significantly to downwind nonattainment at the next\nfuture downwind deadline.

Although\nthe EPA had promulgated a sulfur dioxide NAAQS in 2010, it\nhad not yet set future attainment deadlines. But the agency\nnonetheless granted the petition because the power plant was\nsignificantly contributing to current nonattainment. See</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773217\"> <a href=\"/opinion/773217/appalachian-power-company-v-environmental-protection-agency-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at\n69,053, </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">69,058.\n\n   The Citizen Petitioners are mistaken to suggest that the\nEPA\u2019s present position is inconsistent with agency precedent.\n\f                             32\nFor several decades, the EPA has consistently interpreted the\nGood Neighbor Provision to require future nonattainment. See\nClose-Out Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 65,889 (discussing past agency\nactions), vacated on other grounds, New York, 781 F. App\u2019x at\n4. The agency\u2019s treatment of New Jersey\u2019s petition fit that\npattern. Downwind sulfur dioxide pollution is usually caused\nby one or a few nearby sources. See Data Requirements Rule\nfor the 2010 1-Hour Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Primary National\nAmbient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), 80 Fed. Reg. 51,052,\n51,057 (Aug. 21, 2015). In the case of the Pennsylvania plant,\nactual emissions were causing pollution levels more than two\ntimes greater than the applicable NAAQS, and otherwise\nallowable emissions would have caused pollution levels more\nthan seven times greater. See Response to Petition from New\nJersey Regarding SO2 Emissions from the Portland Generating\nStation, 76 Fed. Reg. 19,662, 19,668, 19,672 (Apr. 7, 2011).\nBecause a single source was causing New Jersey to exceed the\nNAAQS by a wide margin, the EPA could reasonably have\nconcluded that, absent intervention, New Jersey\u2019s current\nnonattainment would persist into the future.\n\n     No such extrapolation would be reliable for ozone. Ozone\nprecursors are transported over long distances, so downwind\nozone problems often are caused by numerous upwind sources.\nSee EME Homer </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">City.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">496</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201397.

We agree.\n\n      The Good Neighbor Provision requires upwind states to\neliminate excess emissions \u201cconsistent with\u201d Title I of the\nClean Air Act, which includes the deadlines for downwind\nstates to attain the ozone standards.           See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i). As we recently explained in Wisconsin, an\nimplementation plan violates the Good Neighbor Provision if\nit fails to \u201celiminate upwind States\u2019 significant contributions to\ndownwind pollution by the statutory deadline for downwind\nStates to meet the NAAQS for </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">ozone.\u201d</span> <span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nBecause section 126(b) incorporates the Good Neighbor\nProvision, the EPA must find a violation if an upwind source\nwill significantly contribute to downwind nonattainment at the\nnext downwind attainment deadline. Therefore, the agency\nmust evaluate downwind air quality at that deadline, not at\nsome later date.\n\n     In this case, Delaware\u2019s next attainment deadline under the\n2015 ozone NAAQS is the deadline for marginal\nnonattainment areas, which falls in 2021. See supra at 16 &\nn.5. Yet when conducting its analysis of Delaware\u2019s petitions\nat Step One, the EPA chose to examine the State\u2019s air quality\nin 2023. This decision cannot be reconciled with the Good\nNeighbor Provision as we construed it in Wisconsin.\n\n     The EPA\u2019s responses are unpersuasive. It argues that\nmarginal nonattainment areas often achieve the NAAQS\nwithout further downwind reductions, so it would be\nunreasonable to impose reductions on upwind sources based on\nthe next marginal attainment deadline. Nonetheless, Delaware\n\f                              34\nmust achieve attainment \u201cas expeditiously as practicable but\nnot later than\u201d 2021, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1), so upwind\nsources violate the Good Neighbor Provision if they will\nsignificantly contribute to Delaware\u2019s failure to meet that\ndeadline.

But that does not make\nDelaware\u2019s obligation to attain the NAAQS by 2021 any less\nbinding. And an upgrade from a marginal to a moderate\nnonattainment area carries significant consequences, such as a\nrequirement to provide for annual emissions reductions in SIPs.\nSee</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 7511a(b). </span><pre class=\"inline\">So long as upwind sources significantly\ncontribute to Delaware\u2019s nonattainment at its 2021 attainment\ndeadline, they violate the Good Neighbor Provision.\n\nD. Whether Delaware Carried Its Burden\n\n     In sum, here is the basic legal framework for analysis of\nDelaware\u2019s section 126(b) petitions at Step One. First,\nDelaware bore the burden to prove a violation of the Good\nNeighbor Provision. Second, the EPA was required to consider\ndata from out-of-state receptors in the Philadelphia-\nWilmington-Atlantic City Attainment Area, which includes\nparts of Delaware. Third, the EPA was not required to consider\ndownwind areas reflecting only current nonattainment, but it\nwas required to consider areas reflecting nonattainment both\ncurrently and at the next attainment deadline. Applying these\nrules, we conclude that the EPA\u2019s decision to reject Delaware\u2019s\npetitions at Step One was arbitrary with respect to petitions\nunder the 2008 ozone standards, but not with respect to\npetitions under the 2015 ozone standards.\n\f                               35\n    1. 2008 NAAQS\n\n     In its petitions under the 2008 NAAQS, Delaware failed to\nidentify any receptor connected to the State showing current or\nfuture nonattainment.        See Response to Delaware and\nMaryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456. The petitions simply noted\nthe number of days that air pollution levels in the State had\nexceeded the NAAQS. See Del. Conemaugh Pet. at 3 (J.A.\n160); Del. Homer City Pet. at 3(J.A. 193); Del. Brunner Island\nPet. at 3 (J.A. 221); Del. Harrison Pet. at 3 (J.A. 248). But the\nEPA measures nonattainment based on the fourth-highest daily\nmaximum ozone concentration, averaged across three\nconsecutive years. See Response to Delaware and Maryland,\n83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456. Delaware\u2019s petitions failed to provide\nthat information and thus failed to carry the State\u2019s burden of\nproof at Step One.\n\n     Delaware provided additional information in its comments\nresponding to the EPA\u2019s proposed denial of its petitions. 9\nSpecifically, it highlighted data from a receptor in Bristol,\nPennsylvania that was part of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-\nAtlantic City attainment area. The EPA declined to consider\nthis data because it came from an out-of-state receptor. See\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,456.\nAs explained above, that decision was arbitrary and capricious.\nThe EPA makes no suggestion that, had it considered data from\nthe Bristol receptor, it still might have concluded that Delaware\nfailed to carry its burden at Step One. We therefore hold that\nDelaware carried its burden.\n\n\n\n\n    9\n        The EPA has not argued that Delaware forfeited reliance on\nthis information by failing to offer it in its petitions.\n\f                               36\n    2. 2015 NAAQS\n\n     In its petitions under the 2015 NAAQS, Delaware also\nfailed to provide data showing any current or future\nnonattainment. In its comments on the EPA\u2019s proposed denial,\nDelaware showed current nonattainment at both the Bristol\nmonitor and an in-state monitor in New Castle. Del. Cmts. at\n4, 10 (J.A. 345, 351). But Delaware offered no data showing\nnonattainment at either monitor in 2021, the deadline for both\nareas under the 2015 NAAQS.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 4, </span><pre class=\"inline\">10 (J.A. 345, 351).\nBecause Delaware failed to show that upwind sources will\nsignificantly contribute to nonattainment at its next future\ndeadline, it failed to carry its Step One burden. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wisconsin,</span>\n<span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     After rejecting Delaware\u2019s petitions on this ground, the\nEPA went on to conduct its own independent analysis of future\nattainment, which erroneously considered pollution levels in\n2023 rather than 2021. But because the EPA independently\nrested its decision on Delaware\u2019s failure to carry its burden of\nproof, the agency\u2019s error on this point was harmless.\n\n         III. Denial of All Petitions at Step Three\n\n     Having concluded our review at Step One of the EPA\u2019s\nGood Neighbor framework, we proceed to Step Three: the\nidentification of cost-effective reductions at the named sources.\nOn this front, the parties have separate disputes with respect to\nthe sources that have catalytic controls; the sources that have\nnon-catalytic controls; and the one facility, Brunner Island,\nwith neither. We take each in turn.\n\nA. Catalytic Controls\n\n    Delaware\u2019s three petitions not related to Brunner Island\ninvolve sources that, the State claims, are failing to optimize\n\f                               37\ntheir catalytic controls. Similarly, thirty-two out of the thirty-\nsix sources in Maryland\u2019s petition have catalytic controls that\nthe State says they are failing to optimize. The EPA concluded\nin the Update Rule that such optimization is a cost-effective\nstrategy for reducing NOx emissions. This, Petitioners say, is\nmore or less the ball game. If optimization is the measure of\nGood Neighbor compliance, and if the named sources are\nfailing to optimize, then it necessarily follows that those\nsources are not currently in compliance with the Good\nNeighbor Provision.\n\n     The EPA offered two answers in its denial. First, it said,\nthe latest data showed that \u201cthe control optimization and the\nemission reductions anticipated from the [Update Rule] are\nbeing realized from the 34 units with [catalytic controls].\u201d\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,465\n(emphasis added). Second, it explained, \u201ceven in the event of\nany single-unit variation in performance, the overall reductions\n[attributable to optimization] are occurring within the same\nairshed due to the fact that state budgets and assurance levels\nwere set to ensure those reduction levels statewide and\nregionwide\u201d through the Update Rule\u2019s trading program.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509274\"><a href=\"/opinion/509274/state-of-new-york-v-us-environmental-protection-agency-and-william/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span> at\n50,466. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">In other words, the logic of a cap-and-trade program\nis that not all sources will reduce their individual emissions to\nthe same extent. We uphold the EPA\u2019s first answer as\nreasonable and do not address the second.\n\n     The parties disagree about how to tell if any given source\nis optimizing its controls. (No one has knocked on the plants\u2019\ndoors to see for themselves.) How high do a source\u2019s emissions\nneed to be before we can conclude that it is failing to optimize?\nFor purposes of the Update Rule, the EPA concluded that\noptimizing catalytic controls would result in an average NOx\nemissions rate of 0.10 lb/mmBtu. Update Rule, 81 Fed. Reg.\nat 74,543. That figure was based on the third-best average\n\f                                 38\nperformance of the covered sources between 2009 and 2015, a\nchoice we upheld in Wisconsin over the objection that the EPA\nshould have chosen an even lower </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">figure.</span> <span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">320</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201321.\n\n     Now suppose a source is found emitting above the EPA\u2019s\nestimated average\u2014at 0.11 lb/mmBtu, for instance\u2014after the\nUpdate Rule. Is the source failing to optimize? Petitioners\nseem to think so. See, e.g., Md Br. 29; Citizen Pet\u2019rs Br. 16\u2013\n17; Pet\u2019r-Intervenors Br. 46\u201347. But the EPA explains why\nthat may not be so:\n\n     The optimized rate for any particular unit depends on\n     the unit-specific characteristics, such as boiler\n     configuration, burner type and configuration, fuel\n     type, capacity factor, and control characteristics such\n     as the age, type, and number of layers of catalyst and\n     reagent concentration and type.\n\nResponse to Delaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,466\nn.62. As a result, the bare fact that a source emits above 0.10\nlb/mmBtu is equivocal. It could be evidence that the source is\nnot optimizing, or it could be evidence that that particular\nsource\u2019s optimized rate is higher than average.\n\n    In that light, the EPA approached the question from the\nopposite direction: What sorts of rates are likely to result if a\nsource does not consistently operate its catalytic controls? The\nagency pegged that figure at 0.20 lb/mmBtu, a rate that sources\ncan usually hit by operating only their combustion controls.\nSee id.10 And as the agency observed, virtually all of the\n\n     10\n         Of course, any threshold the agency chose would present a\ntrade-off.

But they mount a further argument that\nthese particular sources are not achieving their individual\noptimized rates because they have performed more efficiently\nin the past. In particular, the Petitioners calculated the \u201chighest\n30-day rolling average rate of emissions experienced by [each]\nsource during its best ozone season,\u201d Md. Br. 23, and argue that\nthe EPA should have required sources to match that\nperformance. The trouble with this argument is that it mirrors\none we rejected in Wisconsin. There, in choosing to look to\neach source\u2019s third-best ozone season for purposes of the\nUpdate Rule, the EPA explained that sources\u2019 very best rates\nare not, in the main, consistently achievable. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wisconsin,</span>\n<span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">320</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201321; Update Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 74,544.\nHaving found EPA\u2019s reasoning on that question reasonable\nonce, we do so again here.\n\n     Delaware\u2019s objection is somewhat different. The State\nacknowledges EPA\u2019s use of the 0.20 lb/mmBtu threshold, but\npoints out that some of the named sources emitted above that\nmark on individual days of the ozone season. See Del. Br. 30\u2013\n31. Since the EPA bases attainment on daily concentrations,\nnot seasonal emissions, Delaware argues that the EPA should\nlikewise control daily emissions to avoid the possibility that\nsources will idle their controls on days with high electricity\n\f                                40\ndemand. We did not have the occasion to consider the Update\nRule\u2019s reliance on a seasonal cap in Wisconsin, since no party\nchallenged that decision there. But as the EPA explained here,\nthere appears to be \u201cvery little difference\u201d between \u201cNOx rates\nfor EGUs for hours with high energy demand\u201d and \u201cseasonal\naverage NOx rates.\u201d Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,466. In other words, Delaware\u2019s concern\nmakes sense but has not been observed in practice. The EPA\nalso noted that there may be valid operational reasons not to\noperate catalytic controls on particular days, \u201ce.g., to avoid\ndamaging or plugging of the [control] or taking a forced outage\nwhere a breakdown leaves the unit unavailable to produce\npower.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 50,466-67. </span><pre class=\"inline\">As a result, that a source ends up\nemitting above 0.20 lb/mmBtu on a particular day is not\nnecessarily evidence of a failure to optimize. The EPA\u2019s\nexplanation was reasonable. 11\n\nB. Non-Catalytic Controls\n\n     We now turn to the next control strategy at issue.\nMaryland contends that the four electric generating units in its\npetition that do not have catalytic controls should be required\nto operate their non-catalytic controls. Maryland argues that\nthe EPA cannot rely on the Update Rule\u2019s conclusion that such\ncontrols are not cost-effective in light of our decision in\nWisconsin. We agree, and because we do not read the denial\n\n    11\n         Maryland argues, relatedly, that the Clean Air Act itself\nrequires daily limits\u2014that a seasonal cap is not a valid \u201cemission\nlimitation\u201d within the meaning of the statute because it does not\n\u201climit[] the quantity, rate, or concentration of emissions of air\npollutants on a continuous basis.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(k). But\nMaryland did not present this interpretive claim in its comments; it\nsaid only that daily limits would be a good idea. See Md. Reply Br.\n6 (citing Md. Cmts. at 6, 11, 39, 45 (J.A. 290, 295, 323, 329)). The\nargument is therefore forfeited. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B).\n\f                               41\nto have offered an adequate argument in the alternative, we\nremand it to the agency with respect to this issue.\n\n     The EPA explained concisely its conclusion that operating\nnon-catalytic controls at these sources would not be cost-\neffective. The Update Rule, the agency said, had already\nconcluded as much on a regional level. See Response to\nDelaware and Maryland, 83 Fed. Reg. at 50,469\u201370. And there\nwas no reason to think these sources were any different, it\ncontinued, because the units identified \u201care relatively small in\nsize and have low emission levels, indicating that the units have\na relatively limited ability to substantially reduce NOx\nemissions.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span></span> at 50,470.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n     We cannot endorse this explanation after Wisconsin.\nThere, we concluded that the Update Rule was impermissibly\n\u201cpartial.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wisconsin,</span> <span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">318</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Reg. at 65,898\n(acknowledging that the EPA could have revisited the Update\nRule\u2019s conclusion about non-catalytic controls in the Close-\nOut Rule if it had found a continuing air quality problem). In\nthat light, the EPA cannot rely mechanically on the Update\nRule for the proposition that non-catalytic controls are not cost-\neffective. And the denial does not seriously suggest that its\nbrief discussion of these particular units amounted to a\nstandalone cost-effectiveness analysis.

Nonconsideration of Maryland\u2019s Petition\n                 Under 2015 NAAQS\n\n     Finally, Maryland argues that the EPA\u2019s refusal to\nevaluate its petition under the 2015 ozone NAAQS was\narbitrary and capricious. We disagree.\n\n     To preserve an issue for our review, a party generally must\nraise the issue before the agency. The Clean Air Act\nspecifically provides that issues must be raised during the\nperiod for public comment in order to be reviewable here. See\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). Likewise, general administrative-\nlaw principles require timely preservation of issues before the\nagency. See United States v. L.A.

Cir. 2004).\n\n     In this case, Maryland\u2019s section 126(b) petition did not ask\nthe EPA to make a finding that upwind sources were\nsignificantly contributing to its nonattainment of the 2015\nNAAQS. On the contrary, the petition sought a finding only\n\u201cwith respect to the 2008 ozone [NAAQS].\u201d Md. Cover Ltr. at\n1 (J.A. 48). Moreover, Maryland repeatedly described its\nemissions problem, its requested finding, and its proposed\nremedy by reference to the 2008 NAAQS. See Md. Pt. at 1, 3,\n4, 17 (J.A. 50, 52, 53, 66). Because Maryland did not ask for\na finding under the 2015 standards, the EPA permissibly\ndeclined to make one. See Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185450\"><a href=\"/opinion/185450/appalachian-power-co-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1036 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\u201cAn agency cannot be\nfaulted for failing to address such issues that were not raised by\npetitioners.\u201d).\n\n    Maryland contends that its petition did request a finding\nunder the 2015 NAAQS, if not in so many words. Specifically,\nMaryland noted that a timely remedy might allow some in-state\nareas also to reach attainment under the 2015 standards. See\n\f                               47\nMd. Pet. at 9, 13, 14 (J.A. 58, 62, 63). But that does not amount\nto requesting a finding under those standards. Instead, it\nsuggests only that a finding under the 2008 standards might\nhave produced further in-state benefits under other standards.\n\n    Alternatively, Maryland responds that its petition did not\nneed to request a finding under the 2015 NAAQS. Maryland\nreasons that, when it filed the petition in November 2016, the\nEPA had not yet issued attainment designations for it under the\n2015 NAAQS. But whether it would have been premature for\nMaryland to request a finding under the 2015 standards at that\ntime is beside the point. In its November 2016 petition\u2014the\nonly one at issue here\u2014Maryland did not request a finding\nunder the 2015 standards. Now that the EPA has designated\nareas in Maryland as failing to attain those standards, the State\nremains free to file a separate petition requesting a finding\nunder them.\n\n     Finally, Maryland notes that it asked for a finding under\nthe 2015 standards in its comments to the EPA\u2019s proposed\ndenial of its petition. But that request came too late. Consistent\nwith Maryland\u2019s petition, the EPA\u2019s proposed action did not\naddress the 2015 standards and failed to give public notice that\nit might do so. See Response to Delaware and Maryland, 83\nFed. Reg. at 50,463. With the proceeding so far along,\nMaryland could not properly request an entirely new finding.\nWe recognize that Maryland was required to preserve\narguments in its response to the proposed denial, 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B), but that hardly entitled it to raise points\nwholly outside the scope of the notice generated by its own\nprior petition. Because Maryland\u2019s request for a finding under\nthe 2015 NAAQS fell outside the scope of the pending\nrulemaking\u2014as triggered by Maryland\u2019s own petition\u2014the\nEPA had no obligation to address it.

In this\nappeal, Ali asks the court to hold that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s\nDue Process Clause categorically applies in full to detainees at\nGuantanamo Bay, and that his ongoing detention violates both\nthe procedural and substantive aspects of the Due Process\nClause. Those broad arguments are foreclosed by circuit\nprecedent. To be sure, whether and which particular aspects of\nthe Due Process Clause apply to detainees at Guantanamo Bay\nlargely remain open questions in this circuit. So too does the\nquestion of what procedural protections the Suspension Clause\nrequires. But Ali has eschewed any such calibrated or as-\napplied constitutional arguments in this case. For those\nreasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Ali\u2019s petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus is affirmed.\n\f                               3\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n    Shortly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,\nCongress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force\n(\u201cAUMF\u201d), Pub. L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001). That\nlaw empowers the President \u201cto use all necessary and\nappropriate force against those nations, organizations, or\npersons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or\naided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11,\n2001[.]\u201d Id. \u00a7 2(a), 115 Stat. at 224. This includes the\ndetention of \u201cthose who are part of forces associated with Al\nQaeda or the Taliban[.]\u201d Al-Madhwani v. Obama, 642 F.3d\n1071, 1073\u20131074 (D.C.

Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 516, 518\u2013519 (2004) (plurality\nopinion).\n\n     Congress subsequently passed the National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-81,\n125 Stat. 1298 (2011). That Act \u201caffirms that the authority of\nthe President to use all necessary and appropriate force\npursuant to the [AUMF] includes the authority for the Armed\nForces of the United States to detain covered persons\u201d until\n\u201cthe end of the hostilities authorized by the [AUMF].\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 1021(a), (c)(1), 125 Stat. at 1562.

He was captured by United\nStates and Pakistani forces in March 2002 during a raid of a\nfour-bedroom guesthouse in Faisalabad, Pakistan. Ali v.\nObama (Ali II), 736 F.3d 542, 543 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Ali kept\ntroubling company there. At the time of the raid, he was living\nwith the al Qaeda facilitator Abu Zubaydah and several of\nZubaydah\u2019s compatriots, including \u201cfour former trainers from\na terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, multiple experts in\nexplosives, and an individual who had fought alongside the\nTaliban.\u201d Id. The guesthouse also contained \u201ca device\ntypically used to assemble remote bombing devices\u201d and\n\u201cdocuments bearing the designation \u2018al Qaeda[.]\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n     In June 2002, the United States transferred Ali to the Naval\nBase at Guantanamo Bay. Ali II, 736 F.3d at 543. A few years\nlater, Ali filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia challenging his\ndesignation and detention as an enemy combatant. Ali v.\nObama (Ali I), 741 F. Supp. 2d 19, 21 (D.D.C. 2011). The\ndistrict court denied the petition. Id. at 27. Applying a\npreponderance of the evidence standard, the district court\nconcluded that Ali was a member of Zubaydah\u2019s forces, which\nthe district court found was an \u201cassociated force\u201d of al Qaeda\nand the Taliban within the meaning of the AUMF. Id. at 25,\n27; see also Pub. L. No. 107-40, \u00a7 2(a), 115 Stat. at 224. The\ndistrict court further found that Ali\u2019s capture in the same\nguesthouse as Zubaydah, combined with evidence that Ali was\ntaking English lessons through one of Zubaydah\u2019s training\nprograms while there, was enough to establish his membership\nin that force. Ali I, 741 F. Supp. 2d at 25\u201326. The court also\ncredited government evidence \u201cplacing [Ali] with Abu\nZubaydah\u2019s force in various places in Afghanistan prior to his\nstay at the Faisalabad guesthouse.\u201d Id. at 26. And Ali\u2019s\n\f                               5\nmembership in Zubaydah\u2019s force was \u201ccorroborated further by\n[his] own admission\u2014when he was first interrogated\u2014that he\nhad gone to Afghanistan to fight in the jihad against the U.S.\nand its Allied forces.\u201d Id.\n\n     This court affirmed, concluding that Ali\u2019s presence in the\n\u201cterrorist guesthouse\u201d alongside other terrorist combatants\nstrongly supported the district court\u2019s finding that he was an\nenemy combatant. Ali II, 736 F.3d at 545\u2013546. Among other\nthings, Ali\u2019s presence in the company of senior leaders of\nZubaydah\u2019s force, the duration of Ali\u2019s stay, his participation\nin English lessons while there, and the presence of documents\nand equipment associated with terrorist activity together\nprovided weighty and substantial grounds for finding Ali to be\nan enemy combatant. Id. at 546.\n\n     On January 11, 2018, Ali joined several other Guantanamo\ndetainees in filing renewed habeas petitions arguing that their\ncontinued detention violated the Due Process Clause and the\nAUMF. The district court subsequently denied Ali\u2019s habeas\npetition.\n\n     First, the district court held that detainees at Guantanamo\nBay are not entitled to the protections of the Due Process\nClause. The court also held that, even assuming the Due\nProcess Clause applied, Ali\u2019s rights were not violated. The\ncourt reasoned that circuit precedent foreclosed Ali\u2019s\nprocedural arguments that (1) the government must show by\nclear and convincing evidence that he remains a threat to\nnational security, (2) government evidence is not entitled to a\npresumption of regularity, and (3) hearsay evidence should be\ninadmissible in AUMF detention proceedings. The court also\nrejected Ali\u2019s substantive due process argument that his\ncontinuing detention no longer served its ostensible purpose.\n\f                               6\n     Second, the district court rejected Ali\u2019s argument that his\ncontinuing detention exceeds the scope of the AUMF. The\ndistrict court read the AUMF to authorize the detention of\nenemy combatants until the hostilities authorized by that\nstatute cease and found that hostilities against al Qaeda and the\nTaliban were ongoing.\n\n    Ali appealed, seeking initial consideration en banc. This\ncourt denied initial en banc review. Ali v. Trump, No. 18-5297,\n2019 WL 850757 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 22, 2019).\n\n                               II\n\n     We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for\nclear error and its ultimate decision to grant or deny habeas\nrelief de novo. Latif v. Obama, 677 F.3d 1175, 1178 (D.C. Cir.\n2012); see also Barhoumi v. Obama, 609 F.3d 416, 423 (D.C.\nCir. 2010).\n\n                               A\n\n     The district court\u2019s decision that the Due Process Clause\nis categorically inapplicable to detainees at Guantanamo Bay\nwas misplaced. See Qassim v. Trump, 927 F.3d 522, 524 (D.C.\nCir. 2019). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Boumediene v.\nBush, 553 U.S. 723 (2008), unequivocally held that\nGuantanamo Bay detainees must be afforded those procedures\nnecessary to ensure \u201cmeaningful review\u201d of the lawfulness of\ntheir detention, id. at 783. See Qassim, 927 F.3d at 524. In\nparticular, detainees are constitutionally entitled to \u201cthose\n\u2018procedural protections\u2019\u201d that are \u201cnecessary (i) to \u2018rebut the\nfactual basis for the Government\u2019s assertion that [the detainee]\nis an enemy combatant\u2019; (ii) to give the prisoner \u2018a meaningful\nopportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to the\nerroneous application or interpretation of relevant law\u2019; and\n\f                                 7\n(iii) to create a record that will support \u2018meaningful review\u2019\u201d\nby federal courts. Id. at 528\u2013529 (formatting modified)\n(quoting Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 779, 783).1\n\n     In identifying those constitutional protections for\ndetainees, the Supreme Court pointed both to the\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of habeas corpus, U.S. CONST. art. I,\n\u00a7 9, cl. 2 (commonly known as the Suspension Clause), and the\nDue Process Clause. Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 771\u2013792; see\nQassim, 927 F.3d at 529.\n\n    Circuit precedent has not yet comprehensively resolved\nwhich \u201cconstitutional procedural protections apply to the\nadjudication of detainee habeas corpus petitions,\u201d and whether\nthose \u201crights are housed\u201d in the Due Process Clause, the\nSuspension Clause, or both. Qassim, 927 F.3d at 530.\n\n     In this case, Ali has chosen not to ground any of his claims\nfor procedural protections in the Suspension Clause. So that\nissue is not before us. Instead, Ali\u2019s main argument puts all of\nhis eggs in one constitutional basket. He argues that the Due\nProcess Clause\u2019s procedural and substantive requirements\napply wholesale, without any qualifications, to habeas corpus\npetitions filed by all Guantanamo detainees. Ali Br. 12 (\u201cThe\nDue Process Clause [a]pplies at Guant\u00e1namo[.]\u201d); id. 13\u201314\n(\u201cAfter Boumediene, it inescapably follows that the Due\nProcess Clause also applies\u2014in the same measure as the\nSuspension Clause\u2014at Guant\u00e1namo to constrain certain\nexecutive branch actions.\u201d); see also Ali Reply 12\u201313; Oral\n1\n This opinion\u2019s references to detainees at Guantanamo Bay and the\nconstitutional protections they enjoy speaks only to foreign national\ndetainees, who compose the Naval Base\u2019s current population in\ndetention. We do not address what protections would apply to\nUnited States citizens or those with similar legal ties to the United\nStates were they to be detained at Guantanamo Bay.\n\f                                   8\nArg. Tr. 4:6\u201312, 7:11\u201315, 13:5\u20137 (in seeking new procedural\nprotections, counsel is \u201cabsolutely\u201d \u201casking for a broader rule\u201d\nthan one that just resolves Ali\u2019s case); id. 20:2\u201321:6.2\n\n     That argument sweeps too far.\n\n     For starters, the argument is in substantial tension with the\nSupreme Court\u2019s more calibrated approach in Boumediene,\nwhich tied the constitutional protections afforded to\nGuantanamo Bay detainees\u2019 habeas corpus proceedings to their\nrole in vindicating the constitutional right to the Great Writ and\nthe judicial role in checking Executive Branch overreach. See\n553 U.S. at 798 (\u201c[P]etitioners may invoke the fundamental\nprocedural protections of habeas corpus.\u201d); id. at 779\u2013783,\n793\u2013795. The court stressed that the scope of constitutional\nprotections must \u201cturn on objective factors and practical\nconcerns, not formalism.\u201d Id. at 764. Yet Ali argues for only\na formal and unyielding line.\n\n     Ali\u2019s argument that the Due Process Clause\u2019s substantive\nprotections apply with full force to all detainees at Guantanamo\nBay also runs crosswise with this court\u2019s decision in Kiyemba\nv. Obama, which held that, for Guantanamo Bay detainees, the\nclaimed substantive due process right to release into the United\nStates had no purchase because a noncitizen who seeks\nadmission to the United States generally \u201cmay not do so under\nany claim of right.\u201d 555 F.3d 1022, 1027 (D.C. Cir. 2009),\n\n2\n  Ali at one point briefly states that \u201cat least some of the protections\nof the Due Process Clause must also reach Guant\u00e1namo because\nthere are no practical barriers that would apply[.]\u201d Ali Br. 13. He\ndoes not develop this argument, though, and we will not make new\nconstitutional arguments for counsel. See Government of Manitoba\nv. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d 173, 179 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (\u201cA party forfeits\nan argument by mentioning it only in the most skeletal way[.]\u201d)\n(formatting modified).\n\f                              9\nvacated and remanded, 559 U.S. 131, reinstated in relevant\npart, 605 F.3d 1046, 1047\u20131048 (D.C. Cir. 2010). That case\nrefutes Ali\u2019s claim that the substantive protections of the Due\nProcess Clause apply across the board to all Guantanamo Bay\ndetainees. And Ali has abstained from pressing any more\ngradated or as-applied Due Process Clause argument here.\n\n     In sum, Boumediene and Qassim teach that the\ndetermination of what constitutional procedural protections\ngovern the adjudication of habeas corpus petitions from\nGuantanamo detainees should be analyzed on an issue-by-issue\nbasis, applying Boumediene\u2019s functional approach. The type\nof sweeping and global application asserted by Ali fails to\naccount for the unique context and balancing of interests that\nBoumediene requires when reviewing the detention of foreign\nnationals captured during ongoing hostilities.\n\n                              B\n\n     To the extent that Ali focuses on particular categories of\nconstitutional objections, the Due Process Clause is of no help\nto him. See Association of American R.Rs. v. United States\nDep\u2019t of Transp., 896 F.3d 539, 544 (D.C. Cir. 2018)\n(\u201c[C]ourts must choose the narrowest constitutional path to\ndecision.\u201d).\n\n                              1\n\n    Ali argues that his continued detention for more than\nseventeen years violates substantive due process. While Ali\u2019s\ndetention has been quite lengthy, under binding circuit\nprecedent the Due Process Clause\u2019s substantive protections\nwould offer him no help.\n\f                              10\n     Among other things, the substantive component of the Due\nProcess Clause \u201cbars certain arbitrary, wrongful government\nactions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to\nimplement them.\u201d Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80\n(1992) (quoting Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990)).\nBut only government action that is \u201cso egregious, so\noutrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary\nconscience\u201d qualifies as arbitrary for the purposes of\nsubstantive due process. Estate of Phillips v. District of\nColumbia, 455 F.3d 397, 403 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting County\nof Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 848 n.8 (1998)).\n\n     Ali contends that his ongoing detention violates\nsubstantive due process in two ways. First, he argues that his\ncontinued detention is driven by a new blanket and punitive\npolicy against releasing detainees and, as such, is \u201cuntethered\nto any ongoing, individualized purpose to detain him.\u201d Ali Br.\n20\u201321. Second, Ali argues that his \u201c[p]erpetual detention\u201d\nbased on an \u201ceighteen-day stay in a guest-house\u201d shocks the\nconscience. Ali Br. 23. Neither argument succeeds.\n\n     First, Ali\u2019s detention is long because the armed conflict\nout of which it arises has been long, continuing to the present\nday. See Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Global\nDeployment of United States Combat-Equipped Armed\nForces, 2018 DAILY COMP. PRES. DOC. NO. 00416, at 2 (June\n8, 2018) (\u201cThe United States remains in an armed conflict,\nincluding in Afghanistan and against the Taliban, and active\nhostilities remain ongoing.\u201d). Given that, Ali\u2019s detention still\nserves the established law-of-war purpose of \u201cprevent[ing]\ncaptured individuals from returning to the field of battle and\ntaking up arms once again.\u201d See Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 518, 521\n(plurality opinion) (\u201c[W]e understand Congress\u2019 grant of\nauthority for the use of \u2018necessary and appropriate force\u2019 to\ninclude the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant\n\f                               11\nconflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-\nof-war principles.\u201d); see also Al-Alwi v. Trump, 901 F.3d 294,\n297\u2013298 (D.C. Cir. 2018).\n\n     Ali does not dispute that hostilities authorized by the\nAUMF are ongoing. Oral Arg. Tr. 22:19\u201323. And although\nthe AUMF was initially enacted in 2001, Congress reaffirmed\nthe government\u2019s interest in detaining enemy combatants by\npassing the National Defense Authorization Act in 2011. Pub.\nL. No. 112-81, \u00a7 1021(a), (c)(1), 125 Stat. at 1562 (affirming\n\u201cthat the authority of the President to use all necessary and\nappropriate force pursuant to the [AUMF] includes the\nauthority for the Armed Forces of the United States to detain\ncovered persons\u201d until the end of the hostilities). Whatever\nsubjective motivations Ali might impute to the government, its\noriginal and legitimate purpose for detaining him\u2014recognized\nby the law of war and Supreme Court precedent\u2014persists.\n\n     On top of that, Ali has little ground to stand on in claiming\nthat time has dissipated the threat he poses. The Guantanamo\nBay Periodic Review Board has specifically reviewed Ali\u2019s\ndetention no less than eight times to determine whether his\ncontinued detention remains necessary to protect against a\nsignificant security threat to the United States. See generally\nExec. Order No. 13,567, 76 Fed. Reg. 13,277 (March 7, 2011)\n(establishing the Periodic Review Board).

But that is a long time to be in the company\nof senior terrorist leaders. Nor does Ali dispute that he was\nactively studying in their English program while there,\nacquiring a skill that would have equipped him to harm the\nUnited States. See Ali II, 736 F.3d at 548 (\u201c[T]he record\nincluded evidence that leaders of Abu Zubaydah\u2019s force\n\n    4\n        Because Ali has repeatedly been found to be unsuitable for\nrelief, this case does not present the question of what protections\nmight apply to a detainee whom the Board has determined to be\nsuitable for release, yet who continues to be detained.\n\f                              14\nprovided English language training to help prepare their\nmembers to better infiltrate English-speaking areas and launch\nsuccessful terrorist attacks.\u201d). Finally, Ali has provided no\nsound basis for concluding that either his ability or his desire\nto rejoin opposing forces has diminished.\n\n                               2\n\n    Ali also argues that, as a matter of procedural due process,\nthe extended duration of the government\u2019s detention of\ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay requires the government to\nshow, by clear and convincing evidence, that continued\ndetention is necessary to avoid specific, articulable dangers.\nHe further contends that the Due Process Clause precludes the\nuse of hearsay evidence and bars the presumption of regularity\nwith respect to the government\u2019s evidence. Circuit precedent\nforecloses each of those arguments.\n\n     To begin with, we have repeatedly held that, to uphold an\norder of detention, the individual\u2019s status as an enemy\ncombatant need only be proved by a preponderance of the\nevidence. See, e.g., Uthman v. Obama, 637 F.3d 400, 403 n.3\n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (\u201cOur cases have stated that the\npreponderance of the evidence standard is constitutionally\nsufficient and have left open whether a lower standard might\nbe adequate to satisfy the Constitution\u2019s requirements for\nwartime detention.\u201d); Awad v. Obama, 608 F.3d 1, 11 (D.C.\nCir. 2010) (\u201cLest there be any further misunderstandings, let us\nbe absolutely clear. A preponderance of the evidence standard\nsatisfies constitutional requirements in considering a habeas\npetition from a detainee held pursuant to the AUMF.\u201d); see also\nAl-Bihani, 590 F.3d at 878.\n\f                                15\n    The same holds true for the use of hearsay evidence during\nhabeas corpus and other detention proceedings. See Al-Bihani,\n590 F.3d at 879.\n\n     As for the presumption of regularity, it is not at all clear\nthat the presumption has even been used in Ali\u2019s case. See\nAli I, 741 F. Supp. 2d at 25\u201327 (setting forth the district court\u2019s\nfactual findings and its conclusion that Ali was a member of\nZubaydah\u2019s force); see also Barhoumi, 609 F.3d at 423 (\u201cWe\nreview the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error[.]\u201d).\nIn any event, this court\u2019s cases have also expressly granted a\npresumption of regularity to certain government evidence. See\nLatif v. Obama, 666 F.3d 746, 755 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n     The bottom line is that we are not at liberty to rewrite\ncircuit precedent in the way Ali desires. See LaShawn A. v.\nBarry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1395 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc) (\u201cOne\nthree-judge panel * * * does not have the authority to overrule\nanother three-judge panel of the court.\u201d).\n\n     Ali responds that, despite these precedents, a new\nbalancing under Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), is\nnecessary because, as his detention drags on, the government\u2019s\nasserted security interest in his continued detention grows\nweaker while his liberty interest grows stronger. See Rasul v.\nBush, 542 U.S. 466, 488 (2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n(\u201c[A]s the period of detention stretches from months to years,\nthe case for continued detention to meet military exigencies\nbecomes weaker.\u201d). In other words, according to Ali, a new\nbalancing analysis is in order because any assumption that\nwartime detention will be temporary \u201chas long since\ndissipated\u201d given the prolonged hostilities. Ali Br. 25.\n\n    That argument does not extract Ali from the force of\nbinding circuit precedent. In developing the procedures\n\f                              16\napplicable to AUMF challenges, this court contemplated that\ndetentions could last for the duration of hostilities. See\nUthman, 637 F.3d at 402 (\u201cThe AUMF, among other things,\nauthorizes the Executive Branch to detain for the duration of\nhostilities those individuals who are part of al Qaeda or the\nTaliban.\u201d); Awad, 608 F.3d at 11 (explaining that the\ngovernment\u2019s \u201cauthority to detain an enemy combatant is not\ndependent on whether an individual would pose a threat to the\nUnited States or its allies if released but rather upon the\ncontinuation of hostilities\u201d). The length for which hostilities\nmight continue was uncertain then and continues to be\nuncertain now. And this court\u2019s ruling on Ali\u2019s initial habeas\npetition expressly recognized that Ali may be detained for an\nextended, and uncertain, period of time:\n\n    We are of course aware that this is a long war with no\n    end in sight. We understand Ali\u2019s concern that his\n    membership in Zubaydah\u2019s force, even if it justified\n    detention as an enemy combatant for some period of\n    time, does not justify a \u201clifetime detention.\u201d But the\n    2001 AUMF does not have a time limit, and the\n    Constitution allows detention of enemy combatants\n    for the duration of hostilities.\n\nAli II, 736 F.3d at 552 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\n\n     Indeed, Ali agrees that, if the hostilities covered by the\nAUMF were a more traditional type of war that continued for\nthis same length of time, there would be no substantive due\nprocess objection to continued detention. Oral Arg. Tr. 21:15\u2013\n19. Yet Ali cites no authority suggesting that the form of\nhostilities that enemy combatants undertake changes the law\nof war\u2019s authorization of their continued detention, especially\nwhen, as here, the government has found that the threat Ali\nposes continues.\n\f                                17\n\n                                C\n\n     Finally, Ali argues that this court may avoid the\nsubstantive and procedural due process issues altogether by\napplying the canon of constitutional avoidance and construing\nthe AUMF to limit the duration of detentions. See, e.g.,\nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 689 (2001) (\u201c[I]t is a cardinal\nprinciple of statutory interpretation * * * that when an Act of\nCongress raises a serious doubt as to its constitutionality,\u201d\ncourts must \u201cascertain whether a construction of the statute is\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\u201d)\n(formatting modified). But because the specific constitutional\nclaims that Ali presses have already been considered and\nrejected by circuit precedent, there are no constitutional rulings\nto be avoided.\n\n                               III\n\n     For all of those reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Ali\u2019s\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.\n\n                                                      So ordered.\n\f        RANDOLPH, Senior Circuit Judge: I concur only in the\njudgment. I do so because Qassim v. Trump, 927 F.3d 522 (D.C.\nCir. 2019), on which the majority relies, cannot be reconciled\nwith the law of this circuit or with the Supreme Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Constitution.\n\n        Qassim announced that \u201cCircuit precedent leaves open\nand unresolved\u201d the question whether detainees at the\nGuantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba are entitled to the\n\u201cprocedural\u201d due process protections of the Fifth Amendment\neven though circuit precedent foreclosed \u201csubstantive\u201d due\nprocess claims. 927 F.3d at 530. That depiction of circuit\nprecedent was not accurate and, more important, it contradicted\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. Rather than \u201copen and\nunresolved,\u201d it is \u201cwell established\u201d that the protections of the\nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u201cdo not extend to aliens\noutside the territorial boundaries\u201d of the United States, including\nthose held at Guantanamo Bay. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S.\n678, 693 (2001).\n\n       To explain my position I begin where Qassim and\ntoday\u2019s majority opinion should have begun \u2013 with the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of the Due Process Clause. I follow a\nwell-marked path. See Qassim v. Trump, 938 F.3d 375, 376\n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (Henderson and Rao, JJ. dissenting from denial\nof en banc review); see also Hernandez v. United States, 785\nF.3d 117, 125-28 (5th Cir. 2015) (Jones, J. concurring).1\n\n\n        1\n           The Fifth Circuit\u2019s en banc decision in Hernandez was\nvacated on other grounds by the Supreme Court. See Hernandez v.\nMesa, 137 S.Ct. 2003. On remand, the Fifth Circuit (en banc) largely\nreiterated the relevant portions of Judge Jones\u2019s 2015 concurring\nopinion. See, e.g., 885 F.3d 811, 817 (5th Cir. 2018) (noting that \u201cno\nfederal circuit has extended the holding of Boumediene [v. Bush, 553\nU.S. 723 (2008)] . . . to other constitutional provisions). This most\nrecent Hernandez Fifth Circuit decision was affirmed by the Supreme\nCourt. See Hernandez v. Mesa, 140 S.Ct. 735 (2020).\n\f                                2\n\n\n       1. Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950)\n\n         The Supreme Court\u2019s seminal decision in Eisentrager,\nrendered in the twilight of World War II, interpreted the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. That\nwell known Clause states: \u201cnor shall any person . . . be deprived\nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S.\nConst. amend. V (emphasis added).\n\n        The lower court in Eisentrager \u2013 which happened to be\nthe D.C. Circuit \u2013 ruled that \u201cany person\u201d in the Due Process\nClause included \u201can enemy alien deprived of his liberty\u201d by the\nUnited States \u201canywhere in the world.\u201d 339 U.S. at 767, 782.2\nThe Supreme Court in Eisentrager firmly rejected that\ninterpretation. Eisentrager\u2019s holding was clear, it was precise,\nand it was contrary to Qassim: a nonresident alien enemy\ndetained by the United States outside of our sovereign territory\nwas, the Court decided, not \u201cany person\u201d within the meaning of\nthe Fifth Amendment and therefore not entitled to the\nprotections of the Due Process Clause. Id. at 782-85.\n\n        The Qassim court paid no attention to the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of \u201cany person\u201d in the Fifth Amendment.\nThere is no good explanation for this omission. The Supreme\nCourt\u2019s ruling made it irrelevant whether the alien\u2019s claim was\none of \u201cprocedural\u201d due process or \u201csubstantive\u201d due process.\nUnder Eisentrager, it was the status of the individual as an alien\nenemy held outside the United States, not the nature of his\nclaims, that barred application of the Due Process Clause. As I\nwill discuss in a moment, when the Supreme Court years later\n\n\n       2\n         See Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 174 F. 2d 961, 963-65 (D.C.\nCir. 1949).\n\f                                    3\n\nconsidered Eisentrager again, it put the case on precisely that\nfooting.\n\n       In light of Eisentrager, whether an alien enemy held at\nGuantanamo Bay3 may invoke the Due Process Clause is not \u2013\nto use Qassim\u2019s words \u2013 \u201copen and unresolved.\u201d Even so, the\nQassim panel insisted that its opinion \u201cexplains in detail its\nconsistency with\u201d Eisentrager.4 It did nothing of the sort.\n\n       Qassim relegated Eisentrager to a footnote. The\nfootnote gave the case citation and appended a brief\nparenthetical. The parenthetical was misleading. It described\nEisentrager as having decided \u201cthat enemy aliens engaged in\n\n\n        3\n          Guantanamo is not part of the sovereign territory of the\nUnited States. The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, Pub. L. No.\n109\u2013148, 119 Stat. 2680 (2005), so provides: \u201c\u2018United States,\u2019 when\nused in a geographic sense . . . does not include the United States\nNaval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\u201d Also, Guantanamo is not part\nof the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(38).\n\n          Even if there were some doubt about Guantanamo Bay\u2019s\nstatus, \u201c[w]ho is the sovereign, de jure or de facto, of a territory is not\na judicial, but is a political question, the determination of which by the\nlegislative and executive departments of any government conclusively\nbinds the judges.\u201d Jones v. United States, 137 U.S. 202, 212 (1890),\nquoted in Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 302 (1918)\nand Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S.Ct. 2076, 2091\n(2015). Thus, \u201cdetermination of [American] sovereignty over an area\nis for the legislative and executive departments.\u201d Vermilya-Brown Co.\nv. Connell, 335 U.S. 377, 380 (1948).\n        4\n           Qassim v. Trump, 938 F.3d 375, 376 (D.C. Cir. 2019)\n(Millett, Pillard, and Edwards, JJ., concurring in denial of en banc\nreview).\n\f                                   4\n\nhostile action against the United States have no immunity from\nmilitary trial.\u201d 927 F.3d at 529 n.5. There is not a word about\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cany person\u201d in the Due\nProcess Clause. In today\u2019s opinion, the majority does not even\ncite Eisentrager, let alone explain how it can possibly be\nsquared with Qassim.\n\n        To sum up, Eisentrager\u2019s holding gives the lie to\nQassim\u2019s assertion that it was an open question whether\nGuantanamo detainees were entitled to due process, procedural\nor otherwise.5\n\n        Neither the Qassim opinion nor the majority opinion in\nthis case can be rationalized on the basis that Boumediene v.\nBush, 553 U.S. 723 (2008), rendered Eisentrager\u2019s Fifth\nAmendment holding a dead letter. First of all, before Qassim we\nhad already decided that Boumediene did not \u201cdisturb existing\nlaw governing the extraterritorial reach of any constitutional\nprovisions, other than the Suspension Clause.\u201d Rasul v. Myers,\n563 F.3d 527, 529 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (per curiam). That is,\nBoumediene was \u201c\u2018explicitly confined\u2019\u201d to the Suspension\nClause and did not disturb \u201cEisentrager and its progeny.\u201d Id. at\n\n\n\n        5\n          The executive branch has, since at least 2009, articulated the\nprocedures to be used for the review and disposition of Guantanamo\ndetainees. These Executive Orders appear to recognize that the Fifth\nAmendment does not apply to the non-resident aliens held at the naval\nstation. See, e.g., Exec. Order 13492, 74 Fed. Reg. 4897-99 (no\nmention of constitutional due process, but noting that individuals held\nat Guantanamo \u201chave the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas\ncorpus\u201d); Exec. Order 13567, 76 Fed. Reg. 13277 (establishing, \u201cas\na discretionary matter, a process to review on a periodic basis the\nexecutive branch\u2019s continued, discretionary exercise of existing\ndetention authority in individual cases\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\f                                 5\n\n529. See also United States v. Bahlul, 840 F.3d 757, 796 (D.C.\nCir. 2016) (Millett, J.,concurring) (quoting Rasul).6\n\n        Perhaps the Qassim court believed that Boumediene\neroded Eisentrager\u2019s precedential value because Boumediene\nstated that \u201cthere are critical differences between Landsberg\nPrison, circa 1950, and the United States Naval Station at\nGuantanamo Bay in 2008.\u201d 553 U.S. at 768. Boumediene added\nthat Guantanamo Bay \u201cis no transient possession\u201d and is in\n\u201cevery practical sense\u201d \u201cwithin the constant jurisdiction of the\nUnited States.\u201d 553 U.S. at 768-69.\n\n        But Qassim made no attempt to distinguish Eisentrager\non this basis. More, Guantanamo Bay is not within the\nsovereign territory of the United States, and its legal status is not\nfor the courts to decide. See note 5, supra. More still,\nimmediately after declaring that the naval station \u201cis no transient\npossession,\u201d Boumediene once again made clear that the scope\nof its opinion concerned only the Suspension Clause. See 553\nU.S. at 769 (acknowledging that \u201cthere are costs to holding the\nSuspension Clause applicable in a case of military detention\nabroad\u201d but distinguishing Eisentrager nonetheless).\nGuantanamo\u2019s status thus cannot be used as a basis for\nexpanding, sua sponte, the reach of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n        Second, even if Boumediene somehow put Eisentrager\ninto doubt, the Qassim court failed to heed the Supreme Court\u2019s\nwarning that its \u201cdecisions remain binding precedent until we\nsee fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent\ncases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.\u201d Hohn\n\n        6\n         The Ninth Circuit agrees. See Thuraissigiam v. U.S. Dep\u2019t\nof Homeland Security, 917 F.3d 1097, 1111-12 (9th Cir. 2019)\n(\u201cBoumediene itself clearly recognized the distinction between the\nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process rights and the Suspension Clause\u201d).\n\f                                  6\n\nv. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 252\u201353 (1998). When a\nSupreme Court decision \u201chas direct application in a case, yet\nappears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of\ndecisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which\ndirectly controls, leaving to th[e Supreme] Court the prerogative\nof overruling its own decisions.\u201d Rodriguez de Quijas v.\nShearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989); see also\nid. at 486 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Agostini v.

Rand, Ltd., 460 U.S. 533 (1983) (per\ncuriam).7\n\n         2. United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259\n(1990)\n\n        The ultimate issue in Verdugo-Urquidez was \u201cwhether\nthe Fourth Amendment applies to the search and seizure by the\nUnited States of property that is owned by a nonresident alien\nand located in a foreign country.\u201d 494 U.S. at 261. Qassim was\nnot directly concerned with the Fourth Amendment and neither\n\n\n         7\n           Qassim and today\u2019s majority opinion quote Boumediene\u2019s\nstatement that the Suspension Clause requires that a record be made\nto allow for \u201cmeaningful review.\u201d See Qassim, 924 F.3d at 524\n(quoting Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 783). This phrase did not confer\nupon the lower federal courts a free-wheeling authority to disregard\nSupreme Court precedent. The Court was not overruling any of its\ncases outside the Suspension Clause. As then-Judge Kavanaugh put\nit for our court, \u201c[m]eaningful review in this context requires that a\ncourt have \u2018some authority to assess the sufficiency of the\nGovernment\u2019s evidence against the detainee\u2019 and to \u2018admit and\nconsider relevant exculpatory evidence\u2019 that may be added to the\nrecord by petitioners during review.\u201d Al-Bihani v. Obama, 590 F.3d\n866, 875 (D.C. Cir. 2010), quoting Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 786.\n\f                                7\n\nare we in this case. But Qassim should have been concerned\nwith the reasoning the Supreme Court used to decide that the\nFourth Amendment did not apply.\n\n       Verdugo-Urquidez discussed Eisentrager not in a\nparenthetical in a footnote but in the text of the opinion.\nEisentrager, the Supreme Court wrote, \u201crejected the claim that\naliens are entitled to Fifth Amendment rights outside the\nsovereign territory of the United States.\u201d 494 U.S. at 269. To\nthe Supreme Court, \u201cour rejection of the extraterritorial\napplication of the Fifth Amendment was emphatic,\u201d 494 U.S. at\n269. After quoting the Eisentrager opinion,8 the Verdugo-\nUrquidez Court wrote this: \u201cIf such is true of the Fifth\nAmendment, which speaks in the relatively universal term of\n\u2018person,\u2019 it would seem even more true with respect to the\nFourth Amendment, which applies to \u2018the people.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n        This portion of the Verdugo-Urquidez opinion was not\ndicta. It was instead an intermediate step in the Court\u2019s\nreasoning. There was nothing extraneous about the Court\u2019s\ncomparing the Fourth Amendment with Eisentrager\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Fifth Amendment. This is why the Court in\na later case treated Verdugo-Urquidez as having \u201cestablished\u201d\nthat Fifth Amendment protections \u201care unavailable to aliens\noutside our geographic borders.\u201d Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S.\n\n\n        8\n           The Court quoted this language from Eisentrager: \u201cSuch\nextraterritorial application of organic law would have been so\nsignificant an innovation in the practice of governments that, if\nintended or apprehended, it could scarcely have failed to excite\ncontemporary comment. Not one word can be cited. No decision of\nthis Court supports such a view. Cf. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S.\n244. None of the learned commentators on our Constitution has ever\nhinted at it. The practice of every modern government is opposed to\nit.\u201d Eisentrager, 339 U.S. at 784.\n\f                                  8\n\n678, 693 (2001).9 Even if one were to consider the Court\u2019s Fifth\nAmendment discussion as dicta,10 which it is not, Qassim cannot\nbe harmonized with Verdugo-Urquidez. Did Qassim even try to\ndistinguish Verdugo-Urquidez? It did not.\n\n       Qassim again relegated the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion to\na footnote, giving the official case citation and attaching a\nparenthetical stating: \u201cFourth Amendment protections do not\napply extraterritorially to a search conducted within a foreign\ncountry of property belonging to a foreign citizen with no\nvoluntary connection to the United States.\u201d 927 F.3d at 529 n.\n5. And that was that. Qassim said not a word about the\nSupreme Court\u2019s analysis of the Due Process Clause or the\nCourt\u2019s discussion of Eisentrager, even though both directly\nimpacted the issue before the Qassim court. The majority\nopinion in this case follows suit.\n\n        3. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001)\n\n        In Zadvydas, the Supreme Court stated that: \u201cIt is well\nestablished that certain constitutional protections available to\npersons inside the United States are unavailable to aliens outside\nof our geographic borders.\u201d 533 U.S. at 693. In support of this\n\n\n        9\n            See pp. 8-9 infra.\n        10\n           Harbury v, Deutch, 233 F.3d 596, 604 (D.C. Cir. 2000),\nrev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S.\n403 (2002), held that even if the Fifth Amendment discussion in\nVerdugo-Urquidez was \u201cdicta,\u201d \u201cit is firm and considered dicta that\nbinds this court.\u201d The court therefore ruled that the Due Process\nClause did not apply to \u201cforeign nationals living abroad.\u201d 233 F.3d at\n602. As to the binding force of Verdugo-Urquidez\u2019s analysis of the\nFifth Amendment, see also People\u2019s Mojahedin Org. of Iran v. U.S.\nDep\u2019t of State, 182 F.3d 17, 22 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\f                                 9\n\nstatement of constitutional law the Court (id.) cited two cases:\n\u201cSee United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 269\n(1990) (Fifth Amendment\u2019s protections do not extend to aliens\noutside the territorial boundaries); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339\nU.S. 763, 784 (1950) (same).\u201d\n\n        How did Qassim respond to the Supreme Court\u2019s recital\nof this \u201cwell established\u201d Fifth Amendment law? Once again\nthe answer is that the opinion did not respond. Instead, as it did\nwith Eisentrager and Verdugo-Urquidez, the Qassim court tried\nto hide the ball. It reduced Zadvydas to a footnote citation with\na parenthetical reading: \u201caddresses the immigration power to\nexclude aliens from entering the United States.\u201d Qassim, 927\nF.3d at 529 n. 5. This conveyed the impression that Zadvydas\nhad nothing pertinent to say about the issue before the Qassim\ncourt, which of course was not true. Once again this portion of\nZadvydas is ignored in today\u2019s majority opinion.\n\n        4. Precedent of the D.C. Circuit Pre-Kiyemba\n\n        Qassim\u2019s team of attorneys candidly admitted that the\nlaw of this circuit was against them.11 On behalf of their client\nin the district court, they \u201centered into a stipulation with the\ngovernment disputing the allegations against him but conceding\nthat, under the existing legal standards which denied him due\nprocess and the ability to see and confront the evidence against\nhim, he could not prevail.\u201d Qassim v. Trump, Dkt. No. 18-5148,\nAppellant\u2019s Br. 10. On appeal, Qassim\u2019s attorneys conceded\nthat circuit precedent foreclosed his sole argument \u201cthat the\n\n        11\n           While they deserve credit for their honest evaluation of\ncircuit precedent, they failed to address or even mention the most\nimportant Supreme Court decisions \u2013 Eisentrager, Verdugo-Urquidez\nand Zadvydas, opinions repeatedly cited in the decisions of our court\nand in the government\u2019s brief in Qassim.\n\f                                  10\n\nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause applies to unprivileged\nenemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay.\u201d Qassim v.\nTrump, Dkt. No. 18-5148, Appellees\u2019 Br. 4.12\n\n       Despite these concessions, the Qassim panel reached out\nand decided the very issue the parties had conceded, and decided\nit \u2013 obviously without any briefing \u2013 in a way that was the\nopposite of what the parties had stipulated.\n\n        The Qassim opinion devoted most of its attention to one\ncircuit case \u2013 Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F.3d 1022 (D.C. Cir.\n2009), vacated, 559 U.S. 131, and reinstated as amended, 605\nF.3d 1046 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Kiyemba, relying on the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s opinions in Eisentrager, Verdugo-Urquidez and\nZadvydas, held that \u201cthe due process clause does not apply to\naliens without property or presence in the sovereign territory of\nthe United States.\u201d 555 F.3d at 1026. According to Qassim,\nhowever, this meant only that the Guantanamo detainees had no\nsubstantive due process rights, which left open the question\nwhether they had procedural due process rights. After all,\nQassim reasoned, only a substantive due process right was\ninvolved in Kiyemba.\n\n        That distinction is too clever by half.13 It once again tries\n\n\n        12\n           Qassim\u2019s attorneys recognized that the panel of our court\nassigned to his case could not \u201coverrule or disregard prior panel\nholdings,\u201d but could \u201crequest[] proceedings en banc to reconsider\u201d\ncircuit precedent. Qassim v. Trump, Dkt. No. 18-5148, Appellant\u2019s\nBr. 5.\n        13\n          A separate statement issued in an earlier stage of this case\nput the substantive-procedural bee in Qassim\u2019s bonnet. See Qassim,\n927 F.3d at 528 (citing and quoting Ali v. Trump, 2019 WL 850757 at\n*2 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Tatel, J. concurring in denial of en banc review)).\n\f                                  11\n\nto divert attention from the essential points of the Supreme\nCourt opinions in Eisentrager, Verdugo-Urquidez and Zadvydas,\nopinions on which Kiyemba and other cases from this circuit\nrelied. As I have explained, those Supreme Court opinions\nrender Qassim\u2019s substantive-procedural dichotomy irrelevant as\na matter of constitutional law. The reason the Due Process\nClause did not apply in Kiyemba was not that the detainees had\nraised a \u201csubstantive\u201d due process claim.14 The phrase\n\u201csubstantive due process\u201d does not appear in the Kiyemba\nopinion. The detainees were not entitled to the protection of the\nDue Process Clause because the Supreme Court has decided that\naliens outside of the United States do not qualify as \u201cany\nperson\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n      In addition to the opinions of the Supreme Court,\nKiyemba relied upon five opinions of this circuit: Pauling v.\n\n\nThat statement did not confront, indeed did not even mention, any of\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s opinions. My colleague may perhaps be excused\nbecause the en banc petitioner failed to mention any of those cases.\nSee note 11, infra.\n\n         Even so, the statement to which I refer confirms my long-\nstanding objection to the practice of individual judges issuing opinions\non denials of rehearing en banc. I thought then and think now that the\npractice \u201crubs against the grain of Article III\u2019s ban on advisory\nopinions. The manner in which these en banc \u2018bulletins\u2019 are\nformulated does not simulate the process of the court when it is\nactually deciding a case. If recurring issues are addressed, en banc\nstatements may be tantamount to prejudgments,\u201d and \u2013 as we see in\nthis case \u2013 often are. Independent Insurance Agents of America, Inc.\nv. Clarke, 965 F. 2d 1077,1080 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n        14\n         Eisentrager itself cannot be distinguished on any such basis.\nThe habeas petitioners in Eisentrager raised procedural due process\nclaims. See Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 174 F.2d at 963.\n\f                               12\n\nMcElroy, 278 F.2d 252, 254 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1960) (per curiam);\nPeople\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran v. U.S. Department of\nState, 182 F.3d 17, 22 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Harbury, 233 F.3d at\n603; 32 County Sovereignty Committee v. U.S. Department of\nState, 292 F.3d 797, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Jifry v. FAA, 370\nF.3d 1174, 1182 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Each of these cases\nsupported Kiyemba\u2019s holding that \u201cthe due process clause does\nnot apply to aliens without property or presence in the sovereign\nterritory of the United States.\u201d 555 F.3d at 1026.\n\n         Qassim, although purporting to recite the law of our\ncircuit, completely neglected these cases upon which Kiyemba\nrelied. This omission is all the more egregious because of the\nfive circuit precedents, four denied procedural due process\nrights to aliens without property or presence in the United States\n\u2013 the very issue Qassim asserted was an open question in our\ncourt. See People\u2019s Mojahedin, 182 F.3d at 22, 25; Harbury,\n233 F.3d at 598, 604; 32 County Sovereignty, 292 F.3d at 798;\nand Jifry, 370 F.3d at 1176, 1183.\n\n       5. Precedent of the D.C. Circuit Post-Kiyemba\n\n         Qassim did cite four post-Kiyemba opinions of this court.\nIts treatment of those cases is of a piece with the rest of the\nQassim opinion.\n\n        One of the four cases was Rasul v. Myers, 563 F.3d 527\n(D.C. Cir. 2009). Rasul relied on the Supreme Court opinions\nin Eisentrager and Verdugo-Urquidez and concluded that \u201cthe\nlaw of this circuit also holds that the Fifth Amendment does not\nextend to aliens or foreign entities without presence or property\nin the United States.\u201d 563 F.3d at 531. Rasul was a procedural\ndue process case. In order to fit the case into its narrative,\nQassim asserted that Rasul \u2013 and the other post-Kiyemba cases\n\u2013 had each \u201creserved such Due Process questions,\u201d \u201csuch\u201d being\n\f                                13\n\nprocedural due process. 927 F.3d at 530. That assertion was not\ntrue with respect to Rasul, and it was not true of the three other\ncases. Rasul did not refuse to decide whether the detainees at\nGuantanamo were entitled to procedural due process. Rasul\ndecided that question and plainly held they were not so entitled.\nSee 563 F.3d at 531. What the Qassim opinion is referring to\nsomething quite different. It is Rasul\u2019s statement that whether\n\u201cBoumediene has eroded the precedential force of Eisentrager\nand its progeny. . . is not for us to determine; the Court has\nreminded the lower federal courts that it alone retains the\nauthority to overrule its precedents.\u201d 563 F.3d at 529.\n\n         The second post-Kiyemba case is Al-Madwhani v.\nObama, 642 F.3d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Al-Madwhani held\nthat Guantanamo detainees could not rely on procedural due\nprocess, stating flatly \u201cthat the detainees at Guantanamo Bay\npossess no constitutional due process rights.\u201d 642 F.3d at 1077\n(citing Kiyemba) (alterations omitted). The Al-Madwhani court\nthen wrote this: \u201cEven assuming Madhwani had a constitutional\nright to due process and assuming the district court violated it by\nrelying on evidence outside the record\u2014premises we do not\naccept\u2014such error would be \u201charmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt . . ..\u201d Id. (emphasis added). The Qassim opinion omitted\nthe highlighted language and by doing so, gave the false\nimpression that Al-Madhwani left open the question whether\nprocedural due process applied at Guantanamo.\n\n         Qassim cited two other Guantanamo cases in support of\nits claim that post-Kiyemba decisions of this court had reserved\nthe question whether \u201cconstitutional procedural protections\u201d\napplied to the detainees. 927 F.3d at 530. As to one of them \u2013\nAamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \u2013 Qassim\ncorrectly states that the opinion assumed \u201cwithout deciding that\nthe constitutional right to be free from unwanted medical\ntreatment extends to nonresident aliens detained at\n\f                                14\n\nGuantanamo.\u201d 927 F.3d at 530. The reason why this use of\nAamer is so misleading should be apparent: whether a detainee\nmay refuse medical treatment concerns substantive not\nprocedural rights. The Aamer court confirmed as much, noting\nthat the detainees \u201cadvance two separate substantive claims\nregarding the legality of force-feeding.\u201d 742 F.3d at 1038.\n\n        The same objection pertains to the fourth case Qassim\ncited \u2013 Kiyemba v. Obama, 561 F.3d 509, 518 n.4 (D.C. Cir.\n2009) (\u201cKiyemba II\u201d). As in Aamer, Kiyemba II dealt explicitly\nand only with substantive due process rights. The detainees\nthere asserted an \u201cinterest in avoiding torture or mistreatment by\na foreign nation\u201d to challenge the government\u2019s decision to\ntransfer them from Guantanamo Bay to another country. 561\nF.3d at 518.\n\n                              ***\n\n        \u201cInconsistency is the antithesis of the rule of law. For\njudges, the most basic principle of jurisprudence is that \u2018we must\nact alike in all cases of like nature.\u2019\u201d LaShawn A v. Barry, 87\nF.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc).                     The\nlaw-of-the-circuit doctrine implements that principle: the same\nissue presented in a later case in the same court should lead to\nthe same result. Id. That doctrine, together with the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s admonition that the lower courts must adhere to the\nCourt\u2019s precedents without anticipating their overruling, were\nblatantly disregarded in Qassim. \u201cWhen a decision of one panel\nis inconsistent with the decision of a prior panel, the norm is that\nthe later decision, being a violation of fixed law, cannot\nprevail.\u201d Sierra Club v. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848, 854 (D.C. Cir.\n2011). And \u201cit is for the Supreme Court, not us, to proclaim\nerror in its past rulings, or their erosion by its adjudications\nsince.\u201d Breakefield v. District of Columbia, 442 F.2d 1227,\n1230 (D.C. Cir. 1970).

Those broad arguments are foreclosed by circuit\nprecedent. To be sure, whether and which particular aspects of\nthe Due Process Clause apply to detainees at Guantanamo Bay\nlargely remain open questions in this circuit. So too does the\nquestion of what procedural protections the Suspension Clause\nrequires. But Ali has eschewed any such calibrated or as-\napplied constitutional arguments in this case.

We understand Ali\u2019s concern that his\n    membership in Zubaydah\u2019s force, even if it justified\n    detention as an enemy combatant for some period of\n    time, does not justify a \u201clifetime detention.\u201d But the\n    2001 AUMF does not have a time limit, and the\n    Constitution allows detention of enemy combatants\n    for the duration of hostilities.\n\nAli </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">552</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(emphasis added) (citation omitted).\n\n     Indeed, Ali agrees that, if the hostilities covered by the\nAUMF were a more traditional type of war that continued for\nthis same length of time, there would be no substantive due\nprocess objection to continued detention. Oral Arg. Tr. 21:15\u2013\n19. Yet Ali cites no authority suggesting that the form of\nhostilities that enemy combatants undertake changes the law\nof war\u2019s authorization of their continued detention, especially\nwhen, as here, the government has found that the threat Ali\nposes continues.\n\f                                17\n\n                                C\n\n     Finally, Ali argues that this court may avoid the\nsubstantive and procedural due process issues altogether by\napplying the canon of constitutional avoidance and construing\nthe AUMF to limit the duration of detentions.

Circuit Pre-Kiyemba\n\n        Qassim\u2019s team of attorneys candidly admitted that the\nlaw of this circuit was against them.11 On behalf of their client\nin the district court, they \u201centered into a stipulation with the\ngovernment disputing the allegations against him but conceding\nthat, under the existing legal standards which denied him due\nprocess and the ability to see and confront the evidence against\nhim, he could not prevail.\u201d Qassim v. Trump, Dkt. No. 18-5148,\nAppellant\u2019s Br. 10. On appeal, Qassim\u2019s attorneys conceded\nthat circuit precedent foreclosed his sole argument \u201cthat the\n\n        11\n           While they deserve credit for their honest evaluation of\ncircuit precedent, they failed to address or even mention the most\nimportant Supreme Court decisions \u2013 Eisentrager, Verdugo-Urquidez\nand Zadvydas, opinions repeatedly cited in the decisions of our court\nand in the government\u2019s brief in Qassim.\n\f                                  10\n\nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause applies to unprivileged\nenemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay.\u201d Qassim v.\nTrump, Dkt.

Obama, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(D.C.

Cir. 2010). Kiyemba, relying on the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s opinions in Eisentrager, Verdugo-Urquidez and\nZadvydas, held that \u201cthe due process clause does not apply to\naliens without property or presence in the sovereign territory of\nthe United </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">States.\u201d</span> <span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1026</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. According to Qassim,\nhowever, this meant only that the Guantanamo detainees had no\nsubstantive due process rights, which left open the question\nwhether they had procedural due process rights. After all,\nQassim reasoned, only a substantive due process right was\ninvolved in Kiyemba.\n\n        That distinction is too clever by half.13 It once again tries\n\n\n        12\n           Qassim\u2019s attorneys recognized that the panel of our court\nassigned to his case could not \u201coverrule or disregard prior panel\nholdings,\u201d but could \u201crequest[] proceedings en banc to reconsider\u201d\ncircuit precedent. Qassim v. Trump, Dkt. No. 18-5148, Appellant\u2019s\nBr. 5.\n        13\n          A separate statement issued in an earlier stage of this case\nput the substantive-procedural bee in Qassim\u2019s bonnet. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Qassim,</span>\n<span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">528</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(citing and quoting Ali v.

As I have explained, those Supreme Court opinions\nrender Qassim\u2019s substantive-procedural dichotomy irrelevant as\na matter of constitutional law. The reason the Due Process\nClause did not apply in Kiyemba was not that the detainees had\nraised a \u201csubstantive\u201d due process claim.14 The phrase\n\u201csubstantive due process\u201d does not appear in the Kiyemba\nopinion. The detainees were not entitled to the protection of the\nDue Process Clause because the Supreme Court has decided that\naliens outside of the United States do not qualify as \u201cany\nperson\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n      In addition to the opinions of the Supreme Court,\nKiyemba relied upon five opinions of this circuit: Pauling v.\n\n\nThat statement did not confront, indeed did not even mention, any of\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s opinions. My colleague may perhaps be excused\nbecause the en banc petitioner failed to mention any of those cases.\nSee note 11, infra.\n\n         Even so, the statement to which I refer confirms my long-\nstanding objection to the practice of individual judges issuing opinions\non denials of rehearing en banc. I thought then and think now that the\npractice \u201crubs against the grain of Article III\u2019s ban on advisory\nopinions. The manner in which these en banc \u2018bulletins\u2019 are\nformulated does not simulate the process of the court when it is\nactually deciding a case. If recurring issues are addressed, en banc\nstatements may be tantamount to prejudgments,\u201d and \u2013 as we see in\nthis case \u2013 often are. Independent Insurance Agents of America, Inc.\nv.

Precedent of the D.C.

To expedite the development of national\nregulations, section 6(a) authorized the Secretary, for two years\nafter the OSH Act\u2019s enactment, to promulgate then-current\nfederal safety standards without regard to formal rulemaking\nprocedures. Id. \u00a7 655(a). Relevant here, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 50-\n204.6(c), which requires quick-drenching eyewash facilities\nfor workers exposed to corrosive materials, was among the\nmany preexisting standards adopted pursuant to this limited\nrulemaking exemption. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.151(c). Pre-1971,\n\u00a7 50-204.6 had applied only to manufacturers and suppliers\nworking under federal contracts but, after its adoption under\nthe OSH Act, the Secretary began to enforce the quick-\ndrenching provision against employers in other industries,\nincluding construction. In 1993, without notice and comment,\nthe quick-drenching provision was formally designated as a\nconstruction safety standard. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.50(g).\n\f                              3\n     In 2011 the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA) cited Kiewit Power Constructors Co.\n(Kiewit) for a \u201cserious\u201d violation of \u00a7 1926.50(g). Kiewit\ncontested the citation, arguing that the quick-drenching\nprovision was invalidly applied to the construction industry\nwithout notice-and-comment rulemaking. An administrative\nlaw judge (ALJ) agreed, Kiewit Power Constructors Co., No.\n11-2395 (OSHRC Dec. 24, 2012) (ALJ) [hereinafter ALJ\nDecision], as did the Occupational Safety and Health Review\nCommission (OSHRC or Commission), Kiewit Power\nConstructors Co., 27 BNA OSHC 1445 (No. 11-2395, 2018)\n[hereinafter OSHRC Decision]. The Commission vacated\nKiewit\u2019s citation but declined to issue a declaratory order\ndeclaring \u00a7 1926.50(g)\u2019s invalidity. The Secretary and Kiewit\ncross-petitioned for review. Because we conclude that the\nSecretary\u2019s interpretation of the OSH Act is reasonable and\ntherefore entitled to deference from the Commission, we grant\nthe Secretary\u2019s petition for review, deny Kiewit\u2019s and reverse\nthe Commission\u2019s decision.\n\n                              I.\n\n                             A.\n\n     The OSH Act established a comprehensive regulatory\nscheme \u201cto assure so far as possible every working man and\nwoman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions.\u201d\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b). Until then, workplace safety was addressed\nin a patchwork manner by federal and state regulations and, to\na degree, employers\u2019 voluntary efforts. See S. Rep. No. 91-\n1282, at 3\u20134 (1970). The measures were largely ineffective. In\nthe four years preceding the Act\u2019s adoption, more Americans\nwere killed at work than in the Vietnam War and the increasing\nhuman and economic cost of industrial hazards became a\nmatter of serious national concern. See id. at 2.\n\f                                 4\n     A key deficiency of then-existing federal protections was\nthat they did not extend to all employers. For example, safety\nstandards promulgated pursuant to the Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 2036 (codified as amended at\n41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6501\u20136511), applied only to manufacturers and\nsuppliers operating under federal contracts, see 41 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 6502(4). Other labor laws similarly conditioned coverage on\nthe existence of a federal nexus. The Contract Work Hours and\nSafety Standards Act, 76 Stat. 357, amended by\u2014and\npopularly referred to as\u2014the Construction Safety Act of 1969\n(CSA), Pub. L. No. 91-54, 83 Stat. 96 (codified as amended at\n40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3704), authorizes the regulation of contractors and\nsubcontractors working on federally funded construction\nprojects, see 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3704(a)(1). These circumscribed\nscopes meant that, in a given industry, many workers remained\nunprotected even as others were covered by applicable federal\nstandards.\n\n     The OSH Act aimed to close this coverage gap by\nfacilitating the development of \u201cuniformly applied\u201d standards,\nS. Rep. No. 91-1282, at 1, to cover all \u201cbusinesses affecting\ninterstate commerce,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b)(3). The Secretary\nwas therefore \u201cauthoriz[ed] . . . to set mandatory occupational\nsafety and health standards,\u201d id., that \u201crequire[] conditions, or\nthe adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods,\noperations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate\nto provide safe or healthful employment and places of\nemployment,\u201d id. \u00a7 652(8).1 The primary mechanism for\nestablishing occupational safety and health (OSH) standards\nwas set out in section 6(b), which requires the Secretary to\n\n    1\n        \u201cThe Secretary has delegated this [standard-promulgation]\nresponsibility to the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and\nHealth,\u201d who heads OSHA. S.G. Loewendick & Sons, Inc. v. Reich,\n70 F.3d 1291, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing Martin v. Occupational\nSafety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 499 U.S. 144, 147 n.1 (1991)).\n\f                                   5\n\u201cpromulgate, modify, or revoke\u201d any OSH standard in\naccordance with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.\nId. \u00a7 655(b).\n\n     Alternatively, section 6(a) provided an expedited, albeit\ntemporary, path for the issuance of standards. Although\nexisting protective measures had failed to abate industrial risk\nadequately, there remained value in \u201cestablish[ing] as rapidly\nas possible national occupational safety and health standards\nwith which industry is familiar.\u201d S. Rep. No. 91-1282, at 6.\nThus, for a two-year period following the OSH Act\u2019s effective\ndate, the Secretary was to, \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d and\n\u201c[w]ithout regard to\u201d the rulemaking procedures in section 6(b)\nor the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 500\net seq., promulgate as an OSH standard \u201cany national\nconsensus standard, and any established Federal standard,\nunless he determines that the promulgation of such a standard\nwould not result in improved safety or health for specifically\ndesignated employees,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(a). A \u201cnational\nconsensus standard\u201d is one \u201cadopted and promulgated by a\nnationally recognized standards-producing organization,\u201d\nfollowing certain procedural safeguards. Id. \u00a7 652(9).2 An\n\n\n\n\n    2\n        In particular, a \u201cnational consensus standard\u201d:\n\n         (1) . . . has been adopted and promulgated . . . under\n         procedures whereby it can be determined by the\n         Secretary that persons interested and affected by the\n         scope or provisions of the standard have reached\n         substantial agreement on its adoption, (2) was\n         formulated in a manner which afforded an\n         opportunity for diverse views to be considered and\n         (3) has been designated as such a standard by the\n\f                                  6\n\u201cestablished Federal standard,\u201d by comparison, is \u201cany\noperative occupational safety and health standard established\nby any agency of the United States . . . or contained in any Act\nof Congress\u201d as of the OSH Act\u2019s enactment. Id. \u00a7 652(10).\n\n     The Secretary soon invoked his section 6(a) authority and,\nexcused from formal rulemaking, adopted scores of national\nconsensus and established Federal standards as OSH standards.\nSee National Consensus Standards and Established Federal\nStandards, 36 Fed. Reg. 10,466 (May 29, 1971). Part 1910 was\nadded to Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations to house\nthe new OSH standards. Id. Not all established Federal\nstandards, however, were adopted into Part 1910 in the same\nmanner. The CSA standards codified in Part 19263\u2014\npromulgated a mere eleven days before the OSH Act\u2019s\neffective date\u2014were incorporated by reference in Subpart B.\nSee id. at 10,469 (adopting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.12). These new\nOSH standards remained tethered to the CSA standards\n\u201cprescribed in [P]art 1926[,] . . . apply[ing] . . . according to the\nprovisions thereof,\u201d although coverage was extended \u201cto every\nemployment and place of employment of every employee\nengaged in construction work.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.12(a).\nSubpart B also incorporated by reference standards issued\npursuant to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019\nCompensation Act (LHWCA), 44 Stat. 1424 (1927) (codified\nas amended at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 et seq.), which covers\n\n        Secretary, after consultation with other appropriate\n        Federal agencies.\n\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(9).\n     3\n       The CSA standards were originally codified at Part 1518, see\nSafety and Health Regulations for Construction, 36 Fed. Reg. 7340\n(Apr. 17, 1971), but, for ease of reference, we refer to their current\ndesignation at Part 1926, see Redesignation, 36 Fed. Reg. 25,232\n(Dec. 30, 1971).\n\f                                  7\nemployers operating on the navigable waters of the United\nStates, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902(4), 941; see National Consensus\nStandards and Established Federal Standards, 36 Fed. Reg. at\n10,469 (adopting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1910.13\u20131910.16).\n\n     The Walsh-Healey standards, however, were given new\ndesignations elsewhere in Part 1910. Relevant here, Walsh-\nHealey\u2019s \u201cquick-drenching\u201d eyewash standard, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 50-\n204.6(c), was recodified at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.151(c), see\nNational Consensus Standards and Established Federal\nStandards, 36 Fed. Reg. at 10,601.4 Although promulgation as\ndistinct Part 1910 standards suggested that the original Walsh-\nHealey standards were to have a broader scope than those first\npromulgated under the CSA and LHWCA, their reach was far\nfrom clear. On the one hand, \u00a7 1910.5(c)(2) seemed to\ncontemplate that the general standards in Part 1910, i.e., those\nderived from Walsh-Healey standards, were meant to fill in\nregulatory gaps left by particular standards, like the\nconstruction standards prescribed in Subpart B.

On the other hand,\n\u00a7 1910.5(e) appeared to foreclose such a broad application,\ndeclaring that any OSH standard derived from a Walsh-Healey\nstandard \u201cis intended to apply to manufacturing or supply\noperations which would be subject to the Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act if there were a Federal contract . . . involved.\u201d\nNational Consensus Standards and Established Federal\n\n\n     4\n        \u201cWhere the eyes or body of any person may be exposed to\ninjurious corrosive materials, suitable facilities for quick drenching\nor flushing of the eyes and body shall be provided within the work\narea for immediate emergency use.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.151(c).\n\f                               8\nStandards, 36 Fed. Reg. at 10,468 (adopting 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1910.5(e)).\n\n     Any confusion was eliminated, however, when OSHA\nrevoked \u00a7 1910.5(e) on September 9, 1971, a little over three\nmonths after the OSH standards were promulgated. See\nApplicability of Some Established Federal Standards, 36 Fed.\nReg. 18,080, 18,081 (Sept. 9, 1971). OSHA once again invoked\nsection 6(a) to bypass rulemaking procedures, id., claiming\nadditional authority under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.4(b), which\nauthorized OSHA to \u201cmodify or revoke\u201d any Part 1910\nstandard for the full two-year period provided by section 6(a).\nAlthough the published notice is short on reasoning, the\nrevocation\u2019s stated purpose was \u201cto remove the limitation to\nthe application of the standards so that they may apply to every\nemployment and place of employment exposed to the hazards\ncovered by the standards.\u201d Applicability of Some Established\nFederal Standards, 36 Fed. Reg. at 18,081.\n\n     Nevertheless, questions remained as to whether\u2014and to\nwhat extent\u2014the construction industry was subject to the\ngeneral industry standards. The Subcommittee on Editing Part\n1910 for Construction Operations was convened in January\n1974 to consider which general standards \u201cmay be applicable\nto construction operations,\u201d Notice of Subcommittee Meeting,\n39 Fed. Reg. 861 (Jan. 3, 1974), but it failed to resolve the\nlingering uncertainty. Years later, in February 1979, OSHA\nresponded to petitions from \u201cboth labor and management\nwithin the construction industry . . . to develop a single set of\nOSHA regulations for the exclusive use of that industry.\u201d\nIdentification of General Industry Safety and Health Standards\n(29 CFR Part 1910) Applicable to Construction Work, 44 Fed.\nReg. 8577 (Feb. 9, 1979). To consolidate the standards\napplicable to construction companies, OSHA republished Part\n1926 along with the general industry standards \u201cidentified as\n\f                                  9\napplicable to construction work,\u201d id., including the quick-\ndrenching provision, id. at 8589. OSHA\u2019s action was not a\n\u201cpermanent recodification,\u201d however, and merely \u201cprovide[d]\na better public understanding and awareness of OSHA\u2019s\nenforcement policy regarding hazards in construction.\u201d Id. at\n8577.\n\n     Although OSHA intermittently continued to issue\nguidance on applicable construction standards, it was not until\nJune 30, 1993, that it formally designated applicable Part 1910\nstandards as Part 1926 standards. See Incorporation of General\nIndustry Safety and Health Standards Applicable to\nConstruction Work, 58 Fed. Reg. 35,076 (June 30, 1993). The\nquick-drenching provision thereby became a construction\nstandard and received its own Part 1926 designation, at\n\u00a7 1926.50(g). Id. at 35,084, 35,305. And, once again, OSHA\nfollowed neither APA nor OSH Act rulemaking procedures,\nhaving determined the redesignations \u201cdo[] not affect the\nsubstantive requirements or coverage of the standards\nthemselves\u201d and \u201cdo[] not modify or revoke existing rights or\nobligations, []or . . . establish new ones.\u201d Id. at 35,077.\n\n                                 B.\n\n     Kiewit constructs power plants and related generation\nfacilities across North America. On August 3, 2011, OSHA\nvisited Kiewit\u2019s worksite in Rogersville, Tennessee. It cited\nKiewit for a \u201cserious\u201d violation5 of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.50(g)\nbecause \u201cemployees were exposed to eye and skin burns when\n\n\n5\n   A \u201cserious\u201d violation exists \u201cif there is a substantial probability\nthat death or serious physical harm could result from\u201d the workplace\nhazard, \u201cunless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise\nof reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.\u201d 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 666(k).\n\f                                10\nquick drenching facilities were not available.\u201d J.A. 14.6 OSHA\nrequired Kiewit to abate the violation and proposed a civil\npenalty of $3,400. Id. Kiewit timely contested the citation.\n\n     The OSH Act allocates regulatory tasks between two\ndistinct administrative actors. Whereas the Secretary is\n\u201cresponsib[le] for setting and enforcing workplace health and\nsafety standards,\u201d the Commission \u201cis assigned to \u2018carr[y] out\nadjudicatory functions.\u2019\u201d Martin v. Occupational Safety &\nHealth Review Comm\u2019n, 499 U.S. 144, 147 (1991) (second\nalteration in original) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b)). Thus, the\nSecretary, through his OSHA inspectors, issues citations,\nincluding the one charging Kiewit. After \u201can employer notifies\nthe Secretary that he intends to contest a citation,\u201d the\nCommission must provide an opportunity for an evidentiary\nhearing and \u201cshall thereafter issue an order, based on findings\nof fact, affirming, modifying, or vacating the Secretary\u2019s\ncitation or proposed penalty.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(c). \u201cInitial\ndecisions are made by an [ALJ], whose ruling becomes the\norder of the Commission unless the Commission grants\ndiscretionary review.\u201d Martin, 499 U.S. at 148 (citing 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 661(j)).\n\n    Before the ALJ, Kiewit filed a Motion to Dismiss or for\nSummary Judgment, asserting that \u00a7 1926.50(g) was invalidly\npromulgated without notice and comment; it also sought a\ndeclaratory order affirming the same. OSHRC Decision at\n1446 n.1; ALJ Decision at 1. The ALJ granted the motion to\ndismiss, deeming the 1993 recodification of the quick-\ndrenching provision a substantive change that could be\naccomplished only through rulemaking. ALJ Decision at 9\u201310.\nAfter vacating the citation, the ALJ found it unnecessary to\ndecide Kiewit\u2019s motion for a declaratory order. Id. at 1\u20132, 10.\n    6\n       Kiewit was also cited for two non-serious violations but did\nnot contest them. See J.A. 15.\n\f                               11\nBoth the Secretary and Kiewit petitioned the Commission for\ndiscretionary review. The Secretary challenged the vacatur of\nhis citation and Kiewit argued that it was entitled to a\ndeclaratory order.\n\n     The Commission vacated the citation on September 28,\n2018, over the dissent of one Commissioner. OSHRC Decision\nat 1446. Despite reaching the same result as the ALJ, the\nCommission followed a different path. Framing the issue as\nwhether section 6(a) authorized the Secretary to adopt an\nestablished Federal standard\u2014in this case, the Walsh-Healey\nquick-drenching provision\u2014as an OSH standard and, without\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, broaden its scope to include\nindustries not covered by the source standard, the Commission\nfound \u201cthe 1993 codification . . . irrelevant in that regard.\u201d Id.\nat 1448 & n.6. In other words, if the quick-drenching provision\nalready applied to the construction industry by virtue of earlier\nOSHA action, namely, the 1993 action merely formalized\nmatters. The validity of \u00a7 1926.50(g) therefore turned on\nwhether, back in 1971, OSHA\u2019s extension of a Walsh-Healey\nstandard to the construction industry exceeded the scope of the\nrulemaking authority conferred by section 6(a).\n\n     The Commission determined that \u201csection 6(a) . . . is\nsilent as to whether the Secretary may apply \u2018any established\nFederal standard\u2019 adopted \u2018as an occupational safety or health\nstandard\u2019 to industries beyond those the original standard\ncovered\u201d and \u201c[t]he Secretary concede[d] as much.\u201d Id. at\n1448. Despite section 6(a)\u2019s silence, the Commission\nnevertheless concluded that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his\nauthority thereunder was not entitled to Chevron deference.\n\f                                12\n     First, it viewed the promulgation of \u00a7 1910.5(e)7 as\nevidence that the Secretary \u201cinitially interpreted section 6(a) as\nprecluding him from expanding the scope of established\nfederal standards to other industries.\u201d Id. at 1449. His\n\u201ccomplete about-face\u201d\u2014revoking \u00a7 1910.5(e) a mere three\nmonths later\u2014lacked a reasoned explanation and was therefore\narbitrary and capricious and undeserving of deference. Id. at\n1449\u201350 (citing Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct.\n2117, 2125\u201326 (2016)).\n\n     The Secretary\u2019s interpretation was \u201calso unreasonable in\nlight of the language of [section 6(a)], its statutory context, and\nthe statutory history.\u201d Id. at 1450 (citing Gen. Motors Corp. v.\nRuckelshaus, 742 F.2d 1561, 1570 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). Section\n6(a) did not authorize substantive changes to preexisting\nstandards\u2014a point the Secretary does not dispute. Id. at 1451.\nSeeing no distinction between a standard\u2019s protective terms and\nits scope, the Commission concluded that extending an\nestablished Federal standard to a new industry effected a\nsubstantive change and was therefore impermissible. Id. The\nSecretary\u2019s interpretation would, contrary to congressional\nintent, subject employers to standards without first giving them\nan opportunity to provide input and, moreover, would create\n\u201cabsurdities\u201d by applying standards without regard to the\nnuances of a given employment setting. Id. at 1450\u201351.\n\n     Finally, the Secretary\u2019s reliance on Commission and\ncircuit court precedent proved unavailing, as the Commission\ndistinguished Bechtel Power Co., 4 BNA OSHC 1005 (No.\n5064, 1976), aff\u2019d, 548 F.2d 248 (8th Cir. 1977), and American\nCan Co., 10 BNA OSHC 1305 (Nos. 76-5162, 77-773, 78-\n\n    7\n        To refresh recall, \u00a7 1910.5(e) limited the application of\nstandards originally promulgated under the Walsh-Healey Act to\nplaces of employment that would have been subject to the Walsh-\nHealey Act if a federal contract were involved.\n\f                                 13\n4478, 1982), and similarly found Diebold, Inc. v. Marshall, 585\nF.2d 1327 (6th Cir. 1978), and Lee Way Motor Freight, Inc. v.\nSecretary of Labor, 511 F.2d 864 (10th Cir. 1975), inapposite,\nsee OSHRC Decision at 1454.\n\n     In sum, the Commission vacated Kiewit\u2019s serious\nviolation because \u00a7 1926.50(g) \u201cwas invalidly promulgated as\na construction standard\u201d inasmuch as \u201cthe Secretary lacked\nauthority to expand the scope of the [Walsh-Healey] quick-\ndrenching standard and apply [it] to the construction industry\nwithout notice-and-comment rulemaking.\u201d Id. However, the\nmajority deemed Kiewit\u2019s claim that a declaratory order \u201cmight\n\u2018coerce\u2019 the Secretary into deleting the cited provision from\nPart 1926\u201d too speculative. Id. at 1446 n.1. Commissioner\nAttwood dissented, finding that section 6(a) plainly authorized\nthe Secretary to extend standards to new industries and,\nalternatively, that even assuming the statutory text\u2019s ambiguity,\nthe Secretary\u2019s interpretation was reasonable and entitled to\nChevron deference. Id. at 1454\u201355 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r,\ndissenting).\n\n     Kiewit petitioned for review in our court, challenging the\nCommission\u2019s order insofar as it declined to grant Kiewit\u2019s\nrequested declaratory order. The Secretary petitioned for\nreview in the Tenth Circuit, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (authorizing\npetition to be filed in court of appeals for circuit where\nemployer has principal office), which Circuit transferred the\nmatter to us, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a)(5) (\u201cIf proceedings are\ninstituted in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the\nsame order, . . . [a]ll courts . . . shall transfer those proceedings\nto the court in which the record is so filed.\u201d). The Secretary\nargues that his interpretation is reasonable and therefore\nentitled to Chevron deference and, further, that the\nCommission\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious because it\ndeparts from precedent without a reasoned explanation.\n\f                                14\n                                II.\n\n     \u201cWe begin, of course, with our jurisdiction.\u201d Capitol\nSprinkler Inspection, Inc. v. Guest Servs., Inc., 630 F.3d 217,\n221 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Under OSH Act section 6(f), \u201c[a]ny\nperson who may be adversely affected by a[n OSH] standard\u201d\ncan seek pre-enforcement judicial review of the standard\u2019s\nvalidity \u201cat any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard\nis promulgated.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f). Although section 6(f)\n\u201cwould be the exclusive method for obtaining pre-enforcement\njudicial review of a standard, the provision does not foreclose\nan employer from challenging the validity of a standard during\nan enforcement proceeding.\u201d S. Rep. No. 91-1282, at 8. In\naddition, section 11(a) provides that judicial review of an\nenforcement proceeding may be had by \u201c[a]ny person\nadversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the\nCommission.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).\n\n     It was not initially apparent how these provisions\ninteracted because \u201c[s]ection 6(f) is silent concerning its\npreclusive effect on post pre-enforcement judicial review of\nsection 6(a) regulations.\u201d Deering Milliken, Inc. v.\nOccupational Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 630 F.2d\n1094, 1099 (5th Cir. 1980). The question, then, was whether\nprocedural challenges could be raised at any time or only\nduring the sixty-day pre-enforcement review period set out in\nsection 6(f). See id. at 1097\u201398. In some circuits, only\nsubstantive validity claims could be considered in an\nenforcement proceeding, see, e.g., Advance Bronze, Inc. v.\nDole, 917 F.2d 944, 951\u201352 (6th Cir. 1990); Nat\u2019l Indus.\nConstructors, Inc. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review\nComm\u2019n, 583 F.2d 1048, 1052\u201353 (8th Cir. 1978); others\npermitted both substantive and procedural challenges, see, e.g.,\nMarshall v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 616 F.2d 1113, 1117\u201318\n(9th Cir. 1980); Deering Milliken, 630 F.2d at 1099. We\n\f                               15\nadopted the latter approach in Simplex Time Recorder Co. v.\nSecretary of Labor, 766 F.2d 575 (D.C. Cir. 1985), concluding\n\u201cthat Congress intended review of the validity of section 6\nstandards to be available in enforcement proceedings before the\nCommission, and that Congress drew no distinction between\nprocedural and substantive challenges in this regard,\u201d id. at 583\nn.2. Thus, under Simplex, Kiewit\u2019s procedural challenge to the\nquick-drenching provision \u201cwould likely be allowed.\u201d OSHRC\nDecision at 1454 n.1 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r, dissenting).\n\n     The Secretary failed to contest the timeliness of Kiewit\u2019s\nchallenge before the Commission, id., and the parties do not\ndispute our jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660, see Sec\u2019y\u2019s Br.\n1; Kiewit Br 1. Even so, the jurisdictional question is one \u201cthe\ncourt is bound to ask and answer for itself, even when not\notherwise suggested, and without respect to the relation of the\nparties to it.\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S.\n83, 94 (1998) (quoting Great S. Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones,\n177 U.S. 449, 453 (1900)). We ex mero motu ordered\nsupplemental briefing to address whether Simplex remained\ngood law following JEM Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 22 F.3d\n320 (D.C. Cir. 1994), which held that \u201cchallenges to the\nprocedural lineage of agency regulations, whether raised by\ndirect appeal . . . or as a defense to an agency enforcement\nproceeding, will not be entertained outside the 60-day period\nprovided by\u201d the Hobbs Act, id. at 325. We later applied JEM\nto analogous review provisions in other statutes, confirming\nthat \u201cprocedural attacks on a rule\u2019s adoption are barred even\nwhen it is applied.\u201d Indep. Cmty. Bankers of Am. v. Bd. of\nGovernors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 195 F.3d 28, 34 (D.C. Cir.\n1999) (Bank Holding Company Act). The question is whether\nJEM and its progeny foreclosed what Simplex endorsed: the\nraising of an otherwise untimely procedural challenge in an\nenforcement proceeding.\n\f                                16\n     We conclude that Simplex remains binding precedent and,\naccordingly, we have jurisdiction of this petition. Granted,\nJEM and later decisions have strictly construed statutory\nlimitation      periods,    emphasizing       the    Congress\u2019s\n\u201cdetermin[ation] that the agency\u2019s interest generally lies in\nprompt review of agency regulations.\u201d JEM, 22 F.3d at 325\n(quoting Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. FCC, 939 F.2d\n1035, 1040 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). But the fact that generalized\nprinciples of finality may bar untimely procedural attacks\nunder other statutes says nothing about the viability of such a\nchallenge under the OSH Act. Although we have differentiated\nbetween procedural and substantive validity in other contexts,\nwe have not expressly rejected Simplex\u2019s conclusions and the\nJEM line of precedent has not addressed the OSH Act\nspecifically. Indicia of congressional intent can vary from one\nstatute to another and we must take care to conduct an\nindividualized inquiry. Indeed, in Simplex itself we\n\u201cexpress[ed] no opinion as to the interpretation of any other\nstatutes that include similar provisions.\u201d 766 F.2d at 583 n.2.\n\n     The Secretary\u2019s criticism that Simplex contained no\nindependent analysis of the OSH Act\u2019s legislative history is not\nespecially persuasive. Although the relevant discussion in\nSimplex is limited to a footnote, it does not follow that this court\ntherefore adopted by rote the position taken by the majority of\nour sister circuits. On the contrary, Simplex made clear that we\nhad \u201cconsidered the evidence of congressional intent put\nforward in these cases,\u201d and were \u201cdoing no more than\ninterpreting congressional intent as to the preclusive effects of\n[the OSH Act]\u2019s provision for pre-enforcement review.\u201d Id.\nNor can it be said that Simplex was decided without regard to\n\u201cany of the relevant policy concerns this court would later\nrecognize.\u201d Sec\u2019y\u2019s Suppl. Br. 10. JEM was not the first time\nwe addressed the finality interest at stake in belated procedural\nchallenges. \u201cIn a long line of cases\u201d going back to Functional\n\f                               17\nMusic, Inc. v. FCC, 274 F.2d 543 (D.C. Cir. 1958), cert.\ndenied, 361 U.S. 813 (1959), \u201cthis court has repeatedly\ndistinguished indirect attacks on the substantive validity of\nregulations initiated more than sixty days after their\npromulgation from like attacks on their procedural lineage.\u201d\nNLRB Union v. FLRA, 834 F.2d 191, 195 (D.C. Cir 1987). Yet\nSimplex did not cite Functional Music or any related case; it\nrelied entirely on persuasive authority addressing the unique\nconsiderations underlying the OSH Act\u2019s review scheme. See\n766 F.2d at 582 n.2. In other words, the Simplex court found\nthe Congress\u2019s intent behind the OSH Act\u2014not generalized\nfinality concerns\u2014critical to the question of section 6(f)\u2019s\npreclusive effect.\n\n     Equally unavailing is the Secretary\u2019s reliance on RSR\nCorp. v. Donovan, 747 F.2d 294 (5th Cir. 1984). In RSR Corp.,\nthe Fifth Circuit declined to extend Deering Milliken\u2014one of\nthe cases Simplex chiefly relied upon\u2014and did not entertain a\nsubstantive validity challenge in an enforcement proceeding.\nId. at 302. The Secretary curiously claims that Simplex lacked\n\u201cthe benefit of . . . [this] subsequent decision,\u201d Sec\u2019y\u2019s Suppl.\nBr. 15, but Simplex was decided over six months after RSR\nCorp., compare Simplex, 766 F.2d at 575 (July 5, 1985), with\nRSR Corp., 747 F.2d at 294 (November 26, 1984). Moreover,\nRSR Corp. is readily distinguishable. Whereas the standards at\nissue in Deering Milliken, Simplex and this case were adopted\nunder section 6(a), the challenged regulation in RSR Corp. was\npromulgated under section 6(b), a distinction the Fifth Circuit\ntook care to emphasize. See RSR Corp., 747 F.2d at 300\u201301.\nEmployers may have been \u201clulled\u201d by the fact that section 6(a)\nstandards were supposed to \u201cbe pre-existing and familiar to\nindustry\u201d and it would have been \u201cquite burdensome to comb\nthrough every 6(a) regulation and object to inappropriate\npromulgations within sixty days, considering the \u2018multitude of\nregulations (which) could have been promulgated without\n\f                               18\nnotice or hearing within two years of the enactment of\u2019\u201d the\nOSH Act. Deering Milliken, 630 F.2d at 1099 (quoting Union\nOil, 616 F.2d at 1118). RSR, on the other hand, \u201cwas neither\n\u2018lulled\u2019 nor inactive with respect to\u201d the challenged regulation.\nRSR Corp., 747 F.2d at 301. It participated not only in the\nnotice-and-comment process mandated by section 6(b), but\nalso in pre-enforcement judicial review under section 6(f). Id.\nat 298. Plainly, different finality interests are implicated if an\nemployer has in fact had ample opportunity to express validity\nconcerns and tries for a second bite at the apple.\n\n     We see no reason to disregard Simplex\u2019s determination\nthat the OSH Act allows for a procedural challenge in an\nenforcement proceeding, at least for section 6(a) standards. See\nalso Deering Milliken, 630 F.2d at 1099 (\u201c[T]he potential\nnumber and technical complexity of summarily promulgated\nregulations[] makes it particularly inappropriate to find section\n6(f) a bar to procedural attack[s] on 6(a) regulations.\u201d).\nAccordingly, we do not reach Kiewit\u2019s alternative arguments,\nincluding whether section 6(f) is, in fact, non-jurisdictional.\n\n                               III.\n\n     As a preliminary matter, we consider Kiewit\u2019s motion for\nleave to add rebuttal arguments, which it deems necessary in\norder to respond to several points raised in the reply portion of\nthe Secretary\u2019s reply and cross-respondent\u2019s brief. We\ndisagree. Although styled differently, Kiewit\u2019s motion for\nleave to add rebuttal arguments seeks, in effect, to file a\nsurreply. See, e.g., Gibbons v. McBride, 124 F. Supp. 3d 1342,\n1383 (S.D. Ga. 2015) (\u201cThe purpose of a [surreply] is to rebut\narguments advanced in an opposing party\u2019s reply brief . . . .\u201d)\n(citation omitted). \u201cSurreplies are generally disfavored and\n[Kiewit] has not demonstrated that the requested relief is\n\f                                19\nwarranted.\u201d Hall v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, No. 18-5100, 2018\nWL 5919255, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 1, 2018).\n\n     First, Kiewit asserts that the Secretary\u2019s reply brief\nimproperly made several new arguments. It is true that \u201c[w]e\nwill not consider a novel contention first advanced in a reply\nbrief,\u201d Asociacion de Compositores y Editores de Musica\nLatinoamericana v. Copyright Royalty Tribunal, 809 F.2d 926,\n928 (D.C. Cir. 1987), but that is not the case here. The\narguments Kiewit complains of appear in the Secretary\u2019s\nprincipal brief, in substantially similar form. The real issue,\nthen, is that Kiewit disagrees with the Secretary\u2019s position. For\nexample, Kiewit claims the Secretary\u2019s reply brief added new\npoints on legislative history but the substance of its proposed\nrebuttal focuses solely on the Secretary\u2019s purported textual\nmischaracterizations.8 That the Secretary draws different\nconclusions from the underlying sources is insufficient to\njustify a rebuttal. And to the extent the Secretary adopted any\n\u201cnew\u201d positions, he was simply responding to contentions\nmade by Kiewit. This is the very nature of a reply brief. See,\ne.g., United States v. Van Smith, 530 F.3d 967, 973 (D.C. Cir.\n2008). Nor has Kiewit demonstrated that rebuttal argument is\nwarranted to respond to several alleged misstatements in the\nSecretary\u2019s reply brief. Kiewit does not claim the offending\narguments were newly raised. Instead, it simply frames the\ninterpretive dispute as the basis for additional briefing.\n\n   Finally, Kiewit contends the Secretary\u2019s argument that we\nmay not distinguish cases on grounds not used by the\n\n    8\n         In fact, Kiewit has itself mischaracterized the alleged\nmischaracterizations. For example, it quotes language from the\nSecretary\u2019s brief, making much of the fact that the exact wording\ndoes not appear in any of the Secretary\u2019s cited sources. But Kiewit\nreferences the Secretary\u2019s own language\u2014it is entirely expected that\nthe Secretary\u2019s word choice differs from the sources he cites.\n\f                               20\nCommission is inconsistent with circuit precedent. This dispute\nis ultimately irrelevant to our disposition because we do not\ndecide the Secretary\u2019s arbitrary-and-capricious challenge. See\ninfra at 37. In any event, rebuttal briefing is unwarranted. The\nSecretary\u2019s argument was in response to Kiewit\u2014not the\nCommission\u2014so it could not have been raised earlier than the\nreply brief. Although Kiewit concedes it could raise the same\nobjections in a letter filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 28(j), it touts the fact that permitting a rebuttal\nargument will save ninety-two words. There are good reasons\nwhy this minute reduction, without more, does not justify a\ndeparture from the normal cross-briefing rules. In contrast to\nthe proposed rebuttal, the Secretary would have an opportunity\nto respond to a 28(j) letter. Allowing rebuttal argument on these\nfacts risks opening the door to any litigant that disagrees with\nthe opposing party\u2019s arguments to evade the standard briefing\nrequirements and gain the last word. We decline to do so and\ndeny Kiewit\u2019s motion in full.\n\n                               IV.\n\n       We review the Commission\u2019s orders according to\n\u201c[f]amiliar principles of administrative law\u201d and set aside its\n\u201clegal determinations . . .

Cir. 2002)\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)). At issue is whether OSH Act\nsection 6(a) authorized the Secretary to apply the quick-\ndrenching provision to industries beyond those covered by the\noriginal Walsh-Healey standard. We generally defer to the\nSecretary\u2019s interpretation \u201cso long as the statutes and\nregulations in question are ambiguous and the Secretary\u2019s\ninterpretations are reasonable,\u201d AKM LLC v.

Cir. 1995).\n\n      \u201cWhen, as here, \u2018the Secretary and the Commission divide,\nit [is] . . . the Secretary rather than the Commission [who] is\nentitled to\u201d deference, Sec\u2019y of Labor v.

Cir. 1989)), \u201ceven where the Secretary offers his\ninterpretation in the context of litigation before the\nCommission,\u201d S.G. Loewendick & Sons, 70 F.3d at 1294 (citing\nMartin, 499 U.S. at 157 (\u201c[T]he Secretary\u2019s litigating position\nbefore the Commission is as much an exercise of delegated\nlawmaking powers as is the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of a\nworkplace health and safety standard.\u201d)). This approach\nreflects \u201cthe distinct functions of the Commission and of the\nSecretary. Because the Secretary, not the Commission, is the\npolicymaker, we defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation . . . .\nWe do not owe the same deference to interpretations\nindependently offered by the Commission . . . .\u201d Id. at 1294\n(citing Martin, 499 U.S. at 156\u201357).

Cir. 2004) (internal\n\f                                  22\nquotation marks omitted)). \u201cIf the \u2018statute is silent or\nambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\u2019 however, we\nmove to the second step and defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation\nas long as it is \u2018based on a permissible construction of the\nstatute.\u2019\u201d Bluewater Network, 372 F.3d at 410 (quoting\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 843). We agree with the Commission that\nthe OSH Act is ambiguous regarding the Secretary\u2019s authority\nto apply established Federal standards to new industries under\nsection 6(a), see OSHRC Decision at 1448,9 but we conclude\nthat the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his section 6(a) authority\nis permissible and therefore owed deference by the\nCommission.\n\n                                  A.\n\n     \u201cTo discern the Congress\u2019s intent, we generally examine\nthe statutory text, structure, purpose and its legislative history.\u201d\nLindeen v.

Kiewit does not support its\ncontention with any citation to the Commission decision. Nor could\nit, as Kiewit\u2019s claim flatly contradicts the Commission\u2019s express\n\u201cfind[ing] that section 6(a) is ambiguous.\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1448.\n\f                                  23\nconsider \u201cthe broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d\nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997).\n\n     We recognized in Simplex that the Secretary, when acting\npursuant to section 6(a), may not make a \u201csubstantially [sic]\nmeaningful modification of the [established Federal]\nstandard . . . during [its] transformation into an\u201d OSH standard.\n766 F.2d at 584 (quoting Deering Milliken, 630 F.2d at 1100).10\nAlthough the Secretary contends that a modification is\nsubstantive only if it alters a standard\u2019s protective terms, not its\nscope, Kiewit maintains that extending Walsh-Healey\nstandards to the construction industry was in fact a substantive\nmodification in contravention of the OSH Act\u2019s plain meaning\nbecause the revocation of \u00a7 1910.5(e) \u201cchanged \u00a7 1910.151(c)\nfrom inapplicable and not imposing a duty on constructors, to\napplicable and imposing one.\u201d Kiewit Br. 52. Kiewit notes that\nwhen the Secretary promulgated the initial CSA standards, the\nlanguage of the \u201cMedical Services and First Aid\u201d standard was\nlargely borrowed from 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 50-204.6, the Walsh-\n\n     10\n          Although Simplex asked whether the modification was\n\u201csubstantially meaningful,\u201d 766 F.2d at 584 (emphasis added), it\npurported to quote Deering Milliken, which framed the inquiry as\n\u201cwhether a substantively meaningful modification of the Walsh-\nHealey standard occurred,\u201d 630 F.2d at 1100 (emphasis added). This\nsubtle difference may be attributable to the fact that Simplex involved\na national consensus standard. In that context, the Secretary is\nrequired to publish an explanation whenever a promulgated rule\n\u201cdiffers substantially from an existing national consensus standard.\u201d\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(8). In any event, the choice of language does not\nalter our analysis of the established Federal standard at issue here.\nSee, e.g., Diebold, Inc. v. Marshall, 585 F.2d 1327, 1332 (6th Cir.\n1978) (section 6(a) \u201crequired adoption of \u2018established Federal\u2019 and\n\u2018national consensus\u2019 standards without substantive modification\u201d).\nIndeed, Kiewit, after invoking Simplex\u2019s \u201csubstantially meaningful\u201d\narticulation, argues that the quick-drenching standard was\nsubstantively modified. See Kiewit Br. 36\u201338.\n\f                               24\nHealey standard that contains the quick-drenching provision.\nSee Safety and Health Regulations for Construction, 36 Fed.\nReg. 7340, 7347\u201348 (Apr. 17, 1971). Yet the quick-drenching\nprovision was not carried over. Id. Any conclusion drawn from\nthis omission is necessarily speculative. Kiewit has provided\nno evidence that the quick-drenching provision was debated at\nthis time\u2014just that the rest of \u00a7 50-204.6 informed the new\nCSA standard. Rather, it contends that the applicability of the\nWalsh-Healey standards to the construction industry, including\nthe quick-drenching provision, remained a topic of debate until\nthe 1993 codification of certain general standards as\nconstruction standards. But this contention is not inconsistent\nwith the Secretary\u2019s position that general standards apply if no\nparticular standard addresses the same hazard or working\ncondition. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.5(c)(1)\u2013(2); Incorporation of\nGeneral Industry Safety and Health Standards Applicable to\nConstruction Work, 58 Fed. Reg. at 35,076 (\u201c[S]ince early in\nits existence, . . . [OSHA] has determined that it is appropriate\nto cite a construction employer for violation of a part 1910\nstandard, to effectuate the purposes of the OSH Act.\u201d). Simply\nbecause the extent of the coverage overlap between Walsh-\nHealey and CSA standards was not immediately apparent does\nnot mean that the former\u2019s extension to new industries\nnecessarily constituted a substantive modification.\n\n     That said, the line between substantive and non-\nsubstantive modification is not easy to discern. According to\nKiewit, \u201c[s]ubstantive modification means that one is not\nadopting the \u2018established Federal standard.\u2019\u201d Kiewit Br. 35\n(citing Usery v. Kennecott Copper Corp., 577 F.2d 1113,\n1117\u201318 (10th Cir. 1977)). But Kiewit\u2019s definition is far from\nelucidating and leaves open what it means to \u201cnot adopt\u201d a\nsource standard. It cannot be that any minor deviation\nautomatically exceeds the Secretary\u2019s authority for he was not\n\u201crequired to promulgate existing . . . federal standards\n\f                              25\nverbatim.\u201d Simplex, 766 F.2d at 584 (quoting Deering Milliken,\n630 F.2d at 1100). The question, then, is how much a source\nstandard can be altered before the modification is\nimpermissibly substantive. As the Commission previously\nrecognized, the answer depends on congressional intent.\n\u201c[C]hanges in a source standard are permissible if they are the\nsort of changes that Congress allowed the Secretary to make,\u201d\nAm. Can Co., 10 BNA OSHC at 1311, but, here, the OSH Act\nis ambiguous on the point.\n\n    Neither Kiewit nor the Commission disputes that some\nmodification of established Federal standards is acceptable,\ncontemplating that the Secretary could extend the scope of such\nstandards to cover new employers in the original industry. See\nOSHRC Decision at 1453 (section 6(a) allowed Secretary to\nexpand scope of Walsh-Healey standards \u201cto all manufacturers,\nnot just those with federal contracts\u201d); Kiewit Br. 38\n(\u201c[S]ubstantive change would not occur when the Walsh-\nHealey and Construction Safety standards . . . were extended to\nall manufacturers and constructors.\u201d). Kiewit and the\nCommission draw the line, however, at the extension to\nemployers in a different industry. But the language of the OSH\nAct does not plainly support this implicit limitation.\n\n     Granted, there are some colorable arguments that the scope\nof a new OSH standard promulgated under section 6(a) was\nintended to mirror that of its source standard. Established\nFederal standards encompass \u201cany operative [OSH] standard\nestablished by any agency of the United States and presently in\neffect.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(10). In turn, an OSH standard\n\u201crequires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more\npractices, means, methods, operations, or processes,\nreasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful\nemployment and places of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 652(8). Kiewit\ncontends that once a standard found to be \u201creasonably\n\f                                  26\nnecessary or appropriate\u201d for the protection of workers in a\nspecific industry is extended to additional industries, it is no\nlonger the same established Federal standard because no\nfinding has been made that the standard is in fact \u201creasonably\nnecessary or appropriate\u201d for the new \u201cemployment\u201d and\n\u201cplaces of employment.\u201d See Kiewit Br. 36\u201337. Accordingly,\nKiewit asserts that the Secretary cannot utilize section 6(a)\u2014\nwhich authorizes the promulgation of established Federal\nstandards \u201cpresently in effect\u201d\u2014to extend the quick-drenching\nstandard to the construction industry because he never found\nthe standard \u201creasonably necessary or appropriate\u201d to protect\nconstruction workers.11 Id.\n\n    At the same time, the express limitations on the\nSecretary\u2019s section 6(a) authority suggest a more expansive\nscope for newly adopted OSH standards. The OSH Act\n\n     11\n          The Commission made a related argument, asserting that\nWalsh-Healey standards \u201c\u2018presently in effect\u2019 at the time did not\napply to the construction industry,\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1450, but\nits position is unpersuasive. As Commissioner Attwood noted in her\ndissent, \u201cpresently in effect\u201d is more naturally read as a requirement\nthat the established Federal standard must have been \u201con the books,\u201d\ni.e., \u201cin effect on or after the effective date of the OSH Act.\u201d Id. at\n1457\u201358 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r, dissenting). Moreover, rigidly fixing\nthe scope of established Federal standards would preclude even the\nmore limited extensions that the Commission itself accepted. That is,\nextending a Walsh-Healey standard to manufacturers without federal\ncontracts also alters the scope of the standard \u201cpresently in effect\u201d at\nthe time of promulgation. The Commission replies that established\nFederal standards must also be \u201coperative\u201d and that Walsh-Healey\nstandards \u201cwere operative only as to the manufacturing industry.\u201d Id.\nat 1450 fn. 11 (majority opinion). Yet the Commission does not\ndispute that all manufacturers would be covered by a new OSH\nstandard, even though manufacturers without federal contracts fell\noutside the \u201coperative\u201d scope of the precursor Walsh-Healey\nstandard. See id.\n\f                                 27\ninstructs the Secretary to promulgate any established Federal\nstandard \u201cunless he determines that the promulgation of such a\nstandard would not result in improved safety or health for\nspecifically designated employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(a). If\nadopting a Walsh-Healey standard as an OSH standard\nexpanded coverage to manufacturers and suppliers without\nfederal contracts only, it is difficult to imagine when such a\nstandard would not result in improved safety or health for the\nnewly covered employees inasmuch as, before the OSH Act,\nthey would not have been protected by any mandatory safety\nor health standards. Kiewit responds that the Secretary was not\nauthorized to modify a standard, only to refrain from adopting\nit.12 But this assertion does not explain when it would be\nappropriate to not adopt an established Federal standard, if the\nstandard continued to apply only in the industry for which it\nwas originally promulgated. The anticipation that a standard\nwould not improve safety, or that there may be \u201cconflict among\nany such standards,\u201d id., seems to require that an OSH\nstandard\u2019s scope exceed that of its source standard. At a\nminimum, it is at least plausible \u201cthat established federal\nstandards must be expanded to cover employees in additional\nindustries unless application of the standards to the\n\u2018specifically designated employees\u2019 in that industry \u2018would not\nresult in improved safety or health.\u2019\u201d OSHRC Decision at\n1456\u201357 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r, dissenting). Put differently, the\nnew OSH standards could be extended to cover employees in a\nnew industry if those employees were not already protected by\nan analogous, industry-specific standard. This seems a\nreasonable construction of the OSH Act but it does not\n     12\n        Kiewit argued that section 6(a)\u2019s exemption for standards not\nimproving health or safety was intended to address national\nconsensus standards. See Oral Argument at 26:50\u201327:06, 27:43\u201347\n(Oct. 10, 2019). The text of the provision, however, draws no such\ndistinction and plainly applies with like force to established Federal\nstandards.\n\f                                  28\nforeclose Kiewit\u2019s reading that the scope of an OSH standard\npromulgated under section 6(a) is tied by implication to the\nsame industry as its source standard, even if the standard now\nextends to additional employers within that industry.13 The\nplain language of the OSH Act does not reveal the extent to\nwhich the Secretary could expand the scope of section 6(a)\nstandards without resorting to formal rulemaking under section\n6(b). \u201c[T]he fact that the provision can support two plausible\ninterpretations renders it ambiguous for purposes of Chevron\nanalysis.\u201d AFL-CIO v.

The legislative history indicates that section 4(b)(2)\nwas intended \u201cto insure that standards under existing laws will not\nbe repealed\u201d by the OSH Act\u2019s enactment and instead \u201cremain\neffective until superseded by the promulgation of standards under\nsection 6a\u201d in order to \u201cpreserv[e] remedies available under existing\nlaws.\u201d 116 Cong. Rec. 42,206 (1970) (statement of Rep. Steiger).\nAccordingly, section 4(b)(2) \u201chas no bearing on whether section 6(a)\nauthorized the Secretary to expand the scope of established federal\nstandards to additional industries.\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1452. But\nsee Sec\u2019y\u2019s Br. 30 & n.7.\n\f                              29\nF.3d 377, 384 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted)). And, as outlined supra, \u201c[b]ecause the\nCommission\u2019s powers are solely adjudicatory,\u201d it too \u201cmust\ndefer to the Secretary\u2019s reasonable interpretations.\u201d S.G.\nLoewendick & Sons, 70 F.3d at 1294. But, here, the\nCommission withheld deference based on its conclusion that\nthe revocation of \u00a7 1910.5(e) was an arbitrary and capricious\npolicy change and that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of section\n6(a) was unreasonable. OSHRC Decision at 1449\u201350. We\naddress each argument in turn.\n\n                              1.\n\n     The Commission found the revocation of \u00a7 1910.5(e) to be\nprocedurally defective and, accordingly, the Secretary\u2019s\ninterpretation embodied therein\u2014that section 6(a) authorized\nthe extension of established Federal standards to new\nindustries\u2014undeserving of Chevron deference. See id. at 1449\n(\u201c\u2018[D]eference is not warranted,\u2019 however, \u2018where the\nregulation is \u201cprocedurally defective\u201d\u2014that is, where the\nagency errs by failing to follow the correct procedures in\nissuing the regulation.\u2019\u201d (quoting Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct.\nat 2125)). The Commission\u2019s reliance on Encino Motorcars is\nmisplaced. There, DOL issued a 1978 opinion letter departing\nfrom the position it had adopted eight years earlier in an\ninterpretive regulation. 136 S. Ct. at 2123. Over the ensuing\ndecades, DOL continued to affirm its 1978 interpretation and,\nin 2008, finally published a notice of proposed rulemaking to\nrevise the 1970 regulation to accord with existing practice. Id.\nIn 2011, however, \u201cthe Department changed course yet again\u201d\nand \u201cissu[ed] a final rule that took the opposite position from\nthe proposed rule,\u201d abandoning the policy it had applied over\nthe past thirty-plus years in favor of its original 1970\ninterpretation. Id. Critically, \u201c[t]he Department gave little\nexplanation for its decision to abandon its decades-old\n\f                              30\npractice,\u201d id., and the \u201clack of reasoned explication for a\nregulation that is inconsistent with the Department\u2019s\nlongstanding earlier position\u201d meant that the \u201cregulation does\nnot receive Chevron deference,\u201d id. at 2127. The lack of\ndeference reflected more than DOL\u2019s faulty reasoning\u2014\nindeed, the Supreme Court acknowledged DOL\u2019s \u201csummary\ndiscussion may suffice in other circumstances.\u201d Id. at 2126.\nRather, key to understanding Encino Motorcars is the Court\u2019s\nrecognition that, under the circumstances, a cursory\nexplanation was inadequate \u201cin particular because of decades\nof industry reliance on the Department\u2019s prior policy.\u201d Id. In\nother words, the unexplained departure was especially\negregious because DOL\u2019s reversal repudiated the position it\nhad repeatedly affirmed to employers for over thirty years.\n\n     Encino Motorcars is readily distinguishable. First, the\nrevocation of \u00a7 1910.5(e) in September 1971 did not implicate\nthe same reliance concern. Unlike the \u201cdecades-old practice\u201d at\nissue in Encino Motorcars, id. at 2123, \u00a7 1910.5(e) \u201cexisted for\nless than four months, was in effect for less than two weeks,\nand was never even published in the Code of Federal\nRegulations,\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1462 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r,\ndissenting). Moreover, employers were on notice that changes\nto the newly promulgated regulations could occur without\nfurther rulemaking because the Secretary expressly retained his\nsection 6(a) authority for two years and could \u201cmodify or\nrevoke\u201d any Part 1910 standard without notice and comment.\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.4(b). And in the event of conflict between\nPart 1910 standards, necessary action\u2014including modification\nor revocation\u2014should be taken to eliminate the conflict \u201cso as\nto assure the greatest protection of the safety or health of the\naffected employees.\u201d Id.\n\f                                 31\n    The plain tension between \u00a7 1910.5(c)(2) and\n\u00a7 1910.5(e)14 manifests that \u00a7 1910.5(e)\u2019s revocation was not a\n\n\n     14\n         The Secretary also identifies a conflict between \u00a7 1910.5(e)\nand \u00a7 1910.11 but his argument is less convincing on this point.\nSection 1910.11 provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of this Subpart B\nadopt and extend the applicability of, established Federal standards\nin effect on April 28, 1971, with respect to every employer,\nemployee, and employment covered by the Act.\u201d 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1910.11(a). Because \u00a7 1910.11 is itself codified in Subpart B, the\nSecretary contends it is made operative, by its own terms, to all\nestablished Federal standards, including Walsh-Healey standards,\nthereby extending such standards to every employer covered by the\nOSH Act. Better read, \u00a7 1910.11 indicates that the industry specific\nstandards in Subpart B were not to retain the same coverage\nlimitations as their source standards but were to apply to additional\nemployers within the relevant industry. Cf. Bechtel Power Corp., 4\nBNA OSHC 1005, 1008 (No. 5064, 1976) (Secretary was authorized\nto extend, without resorting to formal rulemaking, coverage of CSA\nstandards to construction-industry employers not subject to the CSA\nstandards). The Walsh-Healey standards\u2014which were not\nincorporated into Subpart B\u2014would therefore be unaffected by\n\u00a7 1910.11 and would instead be subject to the general provisions set\nforth in Subpart A. That said, we are unpersuaded by Kiewit\u2019s\ncontention that this purported conflict could not have caused \u00a7\n1910.5(e)\u2019s revocation because the Secretary did not also identify a\nconflict between \u00a7 1910.11 and the circumscribed scope provisions\nin Subpart B. See, e.g., 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.12 (CSA standards\nincorporated by reference from Part 1926 apply only to \u201cconstruction\nwork\u201d). Despite maintaining work-based limitations, these scope\nprovisions still extended coverage to employments not covered by\nthe CSA standards. See, e.g., Bechtel Power Corp., 4 BNA OSHC at\n1007 (construction manager subject to OSH standards even though\nCSA standards applied only to contractors and subcontractors). In\ncontrast, \u00a7 1910.5(e) alone retained the restrictions of a preexisting\nstatute, limiting Walsh-Healey derived standards to employment that\nwould be subject to the Walsh-Healey Act if a federal contract were\n\f                                 32\n\u201ccomplete about-face,\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1449, but, instead,\nwas carried out to \u201cremove[] the anomaly created by the\nconflicting . . . provisions,\u201d id. at 1462 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r,\ndissenting); see also Diebold, Inc. v. Marshall, 585 F.2d 1327,\n1335 (6th Cir. 1978) (\u201cGiven the wide variety of sources for\nthe initial standards package and the rapidity of its\npromulgation, we would be frankly surprised if there were not\nanomalies.\u201d) (emphasis added). Section 1910.5(c)(1) explains\nthe interplay between a \u201cparticular standard . . . applicable to a\ncondition, practice, means, method, operation, or process\u201d and\na general industry standard, providing that the particular\nstandard \u201cshall prevail over any different general standard\nwhich might otherwise be applicable.\u201d 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1910.5(c)(1). \u201cOn the other hand, any standard shall apply\naccording to its terms to any employment and place of\nemployment in any industry, even though particular standards\nare also prescribed for the industry, as in [S]ubpart B or\n[S]ubpart R of this part, to the extent that none of such\nparticular standards applies.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1910.5(c)(2) (emphasis\nadded). Subpart B encompasses the \u201cparticular standards\u201d\nadopted for the construction industry. See id. \u00a7 1910.12. The\nimport of this basic structure aligns with the Secretary\u2019s\nframing of his initial interpretation: the OSH Act authorized\nhim to apply general standards (i.e., those derived from Walsh-\nHealey standards) to \u201cany industry\u201d unless that industry\nalready had a particular standard addressing the same condition\nor hazard. See Anthony Crane Rental, Inc. v. Reich, 70 F.3d\n1298, 1302 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (\u201cUnder this regulatory scheme,\nthe general industry standards apply unless they are preempted\nby specific industry standards.\u201d). The limitation outlined in\n\u00a7 1910.5(e) plainly conflicts with \u00a7 1910.5(c) as a regime\nwherein general industry standards plug regulatory gaps would\n\n\ninvolved. It does not seem inconsistent for the Secretary to identify\na conflict in the latter situation but not the former.\n\f                               33\nbe toothless if only CSA standards could apply to the\nconstruction industry.\n\n     It makes sense that the Secretary retained \u00a7 1910.5(c) at\n\u00a7 1910.5(e)\u2019s expense given the OSH Act\u2019s express instruction\nthat the Secretary favor more expansive protection. See 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 655(a) (\u201cIn the event of conflict among any such\nstandards, the Secretary shall promulgate the standard which\nassures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the\naffected employees.\u201d). And the published notice, despite its\nbrevity, reflects this purpose. See Applicability of Some\nEstablished Federal Standards, 36 Fed. Reg. at 18,081\n(revocation intended \u201cto remove the limitation to the\napplication of the standards so that they may apply to every\nemployment and place of employment exposed to the hazards\ncovered by the standards.\u201d). These facts thus contrast sharply\nwith those in Encino Motorcars, where employers were told a\ndecades-long policy would be reflected in the revised\nregulation, only to have DOL inexplicably veer in the opposite\ndirection. Ironically, despite the Commission\u2019s invocation of\nreliance interests, its decision, not the Secretary\u2019s, invalidates\nan interpretation that has stood for nearly fifty years.\n\n     Moreover, it is a troubling proposition to withhold\ndeference based on the absence of formal rulemaking when, if\nthe Secretary correctly construed the boundaries of his section\n6(a) authority, it was proper for him to act without notice-and-\ncomment procedures. The well-established principle of\nadministrative law underpinning Encino Motorcars and the\nCommission\u2019s decision is that \u201cwhere the agency has failed to\nprovide even [a] minimal level of analysis, its action is\narbitrary and capricious and so cannot carry the force of law.\u201d\nEncino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (citing 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 706(2)(A)). Granted, \u201c[e]xemptions from the terms of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act are not lightly to be presumed,\u201d\n\f                                  34\nMarcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 310 (1955), so we must ask\n\u201cwhether Congress has established procedures so clearly\ndifferent from those required by the APA that it must have\nintended to displace the norm,\u201d Asiana Airlines v. FAA, 134\nF.3d 393, 397 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n\n     The OSH Act expressly exempted the Secretary from APA\nrulemaking, instructing him to promulgate OSH standards\nunder section 6(a) \u201c[w]ithout regard to chapter 5 of Title 5.\u201d 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 655(a); see OSHRC Decision at 1459 n.10 (Attwood,\nComm\u2019r, dissenting) (\u201cSection 6(a) . . . is an unambiguous,\ncomprehensive statement mandating that all rulemaking\nauthorized thereunder is exempt from all APA\nrequirements . . . .\u201d). It is undisputed that, for two years, the\nSecretary could issue OSH standards using section 6(a)\u2019s\ninformal procedure. Indeed, Kiewit does not contest the\nvalidity of other section 6(a) standards, all of which were\npromulgated without notice and comment or reasoned\nexplanation. The question, then, is whether the challenged\nstandards were required to carry over their source standards\u2019\nindustry-centric scopes. In answering, the Commission\u2019s view\non the merits of the Secretary\u2019s position fused with its\ndetermination that his interpretation was procedurally\ndefective, presuming the Secretary could not expand the scope\nof standards promulgated under section 6(a). This was\nimproper because if, as the Secretary maintains, the standards\ncould be applied to new industries\u2014an interpretive question\nusually given deference\u2014the Secretary cannot be faulted for\nbypassing procedures from which the Congress expressly\nexempted him.15 For the same reasons, we reject Kiewit\u2019s\n\n     15\n         We are skeptical of Kiewit\u2019s contention that section 6(a)\u2019s\nexpress procedural exemption does not foreclose the Commission\u2019s\nreliance on Encino Motorcars because \u201cthe Commission never\nattributed its holding to the APA\u201d and \u201c[a]rbitrary and capricious\naction is also prohibited by the Due Process Clause . . . .\u201d Kiewit Br.\n\f                               35\ncontentions that deference is unwarranted because \u201cOSHA is\ninterpreting the OSH Act so as to limit the APA,\u201d Kiewit Br.\n34, and that the APA\u2019s anti-supersession clause, 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 559, requires a narrow construction of section 6(a). Like the\nCommission, Kiewit looks past the OSH Act\u2019s express\nexemption from APA rulemaking and ignores the fact that if,\nas we conclude, section 6(a) authorized the Secretary to extend\nformer Walsh-Healey standards beyond the manufacturing and\nsupply industries, the usual rulemaking procedures were in fact\ndisplaced.\n\n     Kiewit\u2019s additional arguments against Chevron\u2019s\napplication are unpersuasive. First, the \u201c[c]ases applying\nChevron-displacing rules,\u201d Kiewit Br. 31 n.9, are inapposite\nbecause, unlike this case, they implicate unique issues\njustifying departure from normal interpretive principles,\nincluding retroactivity, see INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 320\nn.45 (2001) (\u201cBecause a statute that is ambiguous with respect\nto retroactive application is construed under our precedent to\nbe unambiguously prospective, there is, for Chevron purposes,\nno ambiguity in such a statute for an agency to resolve.\u201d\n(citation omitted)), and Indian law, see Muscogee (Creek)\nNation v. Hodel, 851 F.2d 1439, 1444 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (\u201c[T]he\nstandard principles of statutory construction do not have their\nusual force in cases involving Indian law.\u201d). Nor is Chevron\ndisplaced merely because the Commission and the Secretary\ndisagree. Contrary to Kiewit\u2019s suggestion, we are not\nconcerned that \u201cthe Executive speaks from both sides of its\nmouth, articulating no single position on which it might be held\n\n30\u201331 (citation omitted). Even were we to ignore the explicit APA\nreferences elsewhere in the decision, see, e.g., OSHRC Decision at\n1451 (\u201cModification to APA Notice-and-Comment Process Not to\nBe Lightly Presumed.\u201d), it remains a stretch to conclude that the\nCommission tacitly employed a due process analysis in relying on\nEncino Motorcars, a decision that never mentions \u201cdue process.\u201d\n\f                              36\naccountable,\u201d Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1630\n(2018), because only the Secretary\u2019s interpretation receives\ndeference here. Finally, Kiewit argues that Chevron does not\napply because \u00a7 1910.5(e)\u2019s revocation \u201cfollowed no formal\nprocess.\u201d Kiewit Br. 33 (citing United States v. Mead Corp.,\n533 U.S. 218 (2001)). Kiewit again gives short shrift to section\n6(a)\u2019s express exemption from formal rulemaking; the logical\nextension of Kiewit\u2019s argument is that no interpretation\nembodied in a regulation promulgated under section 6(a)\nwarrants Chevron deference. But Section 6(a) authorized the\nSecretary \u201cto make rules carrying the force of law,\u201d Mead, 533\nU.S. at 226\u201327, and the \u201cinterpretation claiming deference was\npromulgated in the exercise of that authority,\u201d id. at 227.\n\n     In sum, the Commission erred in withholding Chevron\ndeference on account of purported procedural defects. We now\naddress its determination that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of\nsection 6(a) is unreasonable.\n\n                               2.\n\n     \u201c[W]e must accept the [Secretary]\u2019s interpretation if it is\nmerely permissible.\u201d Wagner Seed Co. v. Bush, 946 F.2d 918,\n925 (D.C. Cir. 1991). \u201cWe need not conclude that the\n[Secretary]\u2019s interpretation of the [OSH Act] is \u2018the only one\n[he] permissibly could have adopted,\u2019 or \u2018even the\ninterpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.\u2019\u201d Nat\u2019l\nTreasury Emps. Union v. FLRA, 754 F.3d 1031, 1042 (D.C.\nCir. 2014) (citations omitted) (first quoting Chevron, 467 U.S.\nat 843 n.11; then quoting Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc.,\n556 U.S. 208, 218 (2009)). Here, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation\nof his authority under section 6(a) is not \u201c[in]consistent with\nthe terms of the statute and not unreasonable\u201d and \u201ctherefore,\nentitled to our deference.\u201d Chippewa & Flambeau\nImprovement Co. v. FERC, 325 F.3d 353, 360 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\f                                37\n     First, we disagree that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation\ncreates absurdities by condoning, for example, the application\nof \u201cmaritime or shipbuilding standards . . . to the manufacturing\nindustry, or construction standards . . . to the agricultural\nindustry.\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1451. This argument \u201creflects a\nfundamental misunderstanding of OSHA\u2019s regulatory\nscheme,\u201d       which         contemplates      \u201cthat     standards\napply . . . wherever the working conditions and hazards\naddressed by the standard exist.\u201d Sec\u2019y\u2019s Br. 32 n.8. A standard\napplied to a specialized line of work is, by its terms, unlikely\nto apply in a different setting where the same risk does not\nexist. For example, a standard addressing a danger found only\nin the agricultural industry will not apply to work in a\nmanufacturing plant. But when the same hazardous\ncondition\u2014e.g., exposure to corrosive materials\u2014exists in\ndifferent industries, it is reasonable to apply a relevant standard\nacross industry lines. And the likelihood of absurd results is\nfurther mitigated by the approach outlined in \u00a7 1910.5(c),\nwhich contemplates that general industry standards apply only\nif a specific industry standard does not already address the\ncondition at issue.\n\n     True, cross-industry application may not be appropriate in\nall cases. The unique characteristics of an industry may make\nit infeasible for an employer to adopt a general standard,\nthereby requiring a different solution to abate the same hazard.\nIndeed, Kiewit asserts that applying the quick-drenching\nstandard to construction poses feasibility problems\u2014\nconstruction sites typically lack plumbing and frequent crew\nmovement requires the relocation of portable water containers.\nBut, in addition to the variance procedure set out in OSH Act\nsection 6(d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(d),16 if \u201cstrict compliance with a\n\n    16\n       \u201cAny affected employer may apply to the Secretary for a rule\nor order for a variance from a standard promulgated under [section\n\f                                  38\nstandard is physically impossible or would prevent\nperformance of the work, employers may instead take\nalternative protective measures,\u201d Am. Can Co., 10 BNA OSHC\nat 1310. And whether an employer has provided \u201csuitable\nfacilities for quick drenching,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.50(g), is\njudged on \u201cthe \u2018totality\u2019 of the relevant \u2018circumstances,\u2019\nincluding the nature, strength, and amounts of the corrosive\nmaterial . . . ; the configuration of the work area; and the\ndistance between the area where the corrosive chemicals are\nused and the washing facilities,\u201d Atl. Battery Co., 16 BNA\nOSHC 2131 (No. 90-1747, 1994). The Secretary thus cannot\nsatisfy his burden to establish that facilities are unsuitable\n\u201cmerely by showing that the flushing apparatus is not an\neyewash fountain.\u201d P.J. Spillane Co., 24 BNA OSHC 1253,\n1261 (No. 11-0380, 2012) (vacating citation issued to\ncontractor for eyewash station comprised of hose and eyewash\nbottle). Tellingly, although the Commission recognizes an\naffirmative infeasibility defense, Kiewit has not alleged that it\nwas in fact infeasible to provide suitable quick-drenching\nfacilities here.\n\n     Kiewit next contends that extending the reach of standards\nissued under section 6(a) contravenes the procedural\nrequirements the Congress prescribed for the promulgation of\nnew construction standards. Its assertion that established\nFederal standards could not be made to apply to the\n\n6]. . . . The Secretary shall issue such rule or order if he determines\non the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate\nand a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices,\nmeans, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be\nused by an employer will provide employment and places of\nemployment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as\nthose which would prevail if he complied with the standard.\u201d 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 655(d).\n\f                               39\nconstruction industry absent formal rulemaking procedures is\nbased on language from the Conference Report, setting out the\nconferees\u2019 intent \u201cthat the Secretary develop health and safety\nstandards for construction workers . . . pursuant to the\nprovisions of [the CSA] and that he use the same mechanisms\n. . . for the development of health and safety standards for all\nthe other construction workers newly covered by [the OSH]\nAct.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 91-1765, at 33 (1970) (Conf. Rep.). But\nthe implication that the Secretary could adopt only those\nconstruction standards issued under the CSA is at odds with the\nlanguage of section 6(a), which authorizes the Secretary to\npromulgate \u201cany national consensus standard, and any\nestablished Federal standard\u201d as an OSH standard. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\n655(a) (emphases added). Indeed, under Kiewit\u2019s reading, the\nSecretary would have been unable to adopt any national\nconsensus standards for the construction industry because such\nstandards were not issued in accordance with CSA-mandated\nprocedures. See OSHRC Decision at 1465 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r,\ndissenting). This cannot be. Rather, the Conference Report\u2019s\nforward-looking language suggests the conferees were\nreferring to the development of new construction standards, not\nthe adoption of preexisting standards under section 6(a). A\ncontrary interpretation would exert incredible tension on\nsection 6(a)\u2019s plain language.\n\n     Kiewit also claims the OSH Act\u2019s legislative history\nevinces congressional intent to preserve established Federal\nstandards\u2019 industry-based limitations. It relies primarily on the\nReport of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare,\nwhich states that section 6(a) was designed \u201cto establish as\nrapidly as possible national occupational safety and health\nstandards with which industry is familiar.\u201d S. Rep. No. 91-\n1282, at 6 (emphasis added). That is, established Federal\nstandards \u201chave already been subjected to the procedural\nscrutiny mandated by the law under which they were issued.\u201d\n\f                                40\nId. Therefore, as Kiewit sees it, the Secretary could not extend\nWalsh-Healey standards without rulemaking because the\nconstruction industry neither was familiar with those standards\nnor participated in their original promulgation. The\nCommission agreed, noting the construction industry would\nhave \u201chad no reason or incentive to participate in\u201d the\npromulgation of the Walsh-Healey standards \u201cbecause it was\nnot affected by the rulemaking,\u201d and that \u201c[d]epriving the\nconstruction industry of its \u2018opportunity to participate\u2019 in the\nrulemaking process is contrary to the OSH Act\u2019s language and\nintent.\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1450. This position is facially\nappealing but ultimately unavailing.\n\n     Despite the considerable ink spilled by the parties, the\nOSH Act\u2019s legislative history remains, at best, unilluminating.\nFirst, interested employers\u2019 participation is not dispositive. It is\nundisputed that the adoption of Walsh-Healey standards as\nOSH standards extended their protections to all manufacturers\nengaged in interstate commerce. However, the newly covered\nemployers\u2014those without federal contracts\u2014were not subject\nto the Walsh-Healey Act and therefore had no more reason to\nparticipate in rulemaking than the construction industry.\nGranted, at least some manufacturers were interested and may\nhave adequately represented the manufacturing industry at\nlarge but this was not a given. Cf. S. Rep. No. 91-1282, at 4\n(before standards became mandatory for all employers,\ninvesting in health and safety often put smaller employers at\n\u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d). Many employers ended up\nsubject to standards they had assumed would not apply,\nnotwithstanding the standards went through \u201cthe procedural\nscrutiny mandated\u201d by statute. Id. at 6. Thus, the construction\nindustry\u2019s lack of participation in the promulgation of the\nWalsh-Healey standards does not, alone, affect the\nreasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation.\n\f                                41\n     Second, although it makes sense that the Congress would\nnot have intended industry to be blindsided by standards\nrapidly promulgated under section 6(a), it is not obvious that\nthe standards had to have been scrutinized by each specific\nindustry to which they were to apply or by industry in general.\nIndeed, the Senate Report directing that OSH standards be\nthose \u201cwith which industry is familiar,\u201d id., also recognized\nthat \u201cthe chemical and physical hazards which characterize\nmodern industry are not the problem of . . . a single industry,\u201d\nid. at 4, but instead are \u201ctruly a national concern,\u201d id., that\nshould be addressed through \u201cuniformly applied\u201d standards, id.\nat 1. It seems reasonable, then, for new OSH standards to cross\nindustrial boundaries in order to abate the harms associated\nwith materials that affect both manufacturing and construction\nworkers. See id. at 3. And the OSH Act\u2019s drafters \u201cwere aware\nthat the then recently-adopted Walsh-Healey standards would\nbe the primary source of established federal standards for\nindustrial working conditions covered by the Act.\u201d Gen.\nMotors Corp., 9 BNA OSHC 1331, 1336 (No. 79-4478, 1981)\n(emphasis added). Indeed, the Secretary testified to the Senate\nSubcommittee on Labor that \u201cthe Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act and its companion legislation\u201d were \u201c[t]he only\nFederal [safety and health] laws not confined to a specific\nindustry.\u201d Occupational Safety and Health Act, 1970:\nHearings on S. 2193 and S. 2788 Before the Subcomm. on\nLabor of the S. Comm. on Labor & Public Welfare, 91st Cong.\n80 (1970) (statement of George P. Shultz, Secretary of Labor).\n\n     Our view of the legislative history is not altered by the fact\nthat the House of Representatives rejected a bill proposed by\nRepresentative Dominick Daniels, providing that any\nestablished Federal standard promulgated as an OSH standard\nwas \u201cnot limited to its present area of application,\u201d H.R. 16785,\n91st Cong. \u00a7 6 (as reported by H. Comm. on Educ. & Labor,\nJuly 9, 1970), in favor of a substitute bill introduced by\n\f                                 42\nRepresentative William Steiger, which contained no such\nlanguage, see H.R. 19200, 91st Cong. (1970). The Commission\ndeemed the adoption of the competing Steiger bill \u201cas further\nproof that Congress never intended [Walsh-Healey] standards\nto apply to construction employers.\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1453.\nThis conclusion is far too speculative. Even assuming \u201c[t]he\nvote to substitute was a vote on the Daniels bill,\u201d Kiewit Br. 44\n(citing Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, 445 U.S. 1, 16 & n.23\n(1980)), it is far less clear why the Daniels bill lost. There were\nmany differences between the two bills, chief among them the\n\u201cstrike with pay\u201d provision in the Daniels bill, which\n\u201cencountered stiff opposition in the House.\u201d Whirlpool Corp.,\n445 U.S. at 15. In contrast, the language setting the scope of\nestablished Federal standards was not mentioned during the\nfloor debates. It is therefore an immense leap to derive from the\nDaniels bill\u2019s failure any intent to reject a single phrase in a bill\nladen with controversial provisions. We decline the invitation\nto make this jump.\n\n     Even after considering Kiewit\u2019s myriad arguments made\nin dogged pursuit of its petition,17 whether the quick-drenching\nprovision was properly extended to the construction industry\nremains a question with no obvious answer. It is apparent from\nour efforts to untangle the mare\u2019s nest that is the OSH Act and\nits implementing regulations that the Congress intended some\nscope expansion for standards adopted under section 6(a). See\nS. Rep. No. 91-1282, at 6 (established Federal standards \u201cmay\nbe made applicable to additional employees who are not under\nthe protection of such other Federal laws\u201d). Otherwise, the new\nOSH standards would continue to cover only the limited swath\nof employers subject to preexisting labor laws. But this says\nnothing about how far the Secretary could extend established\n\n    17\n        All arguments not expressly addressed have nevertheless\nbeen considered and rejected.\n\f                               43\nFederal standards without resorting to formal rulemaking. Did\nthe Congress intend a section 6(a) standard to apply only to\nthose employers that would have been covered under the\npreexisting standard if there were a federal contract, to all\nemployers within the same industry, or to all employment\nwhere the condition or hazard exists? Our careful review of the\nOSH Act\u2019s less-than-pellucid legislative history and the\nSecretary\u2019s frequently muddled regulatory efforts has not\nclarified matters. \u201cIf Congressional intent is unclear after\u201d\nanalyzing the statute and relevant legislative history, \u201cthen the\nreviewing court is called upon to determine whether the\nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018permissible,\u2019 that is to say\nreasonable.\u201d Inv. Co. Inst. v. Conover, 790 F.2d 925, 932 (D.C.\nCir. 1986).\n\n     Although it is plausible that the Congress intended\nstandards adopted under section 6(a) to extend only to\nemployers within the same industry as their source standard,\nthe Secretary\u2019s interpretation is nevertheless a permissible\nconstruction of the OSH Act. \u201cStep two of Chevron does not\nrequire the best interpretation, only a reasonable one.\u201d Am.\nForest & Paper Ass\u2019n v. FERC, 550 F.3d 1179, 1183 (D.C. Cir.\n2008). Considering, among other factors, the OSH Act\u2019s stated\npurpose of expanding workplace protections \u201cto assure so far\nas possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe\nand healthful working conditions,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b), and\nsection 6(a)\u2019s instruction that, \u201c[i]n the event of conflict among\nany such standards, the Secretary shall promulgate the standard\nwhich assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of\nthe affected employees,\u201d id. \u00a7 655(a), we find that the\nSecretary\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the OSH Act and\nis therefore entitled to Chevron deference. We do not reach the\nSecretary\u2019s arbitrary-and-capricious challenge because the\nCommission\u2019s failure to \u201cafford proper deference to the\nSecretary\u2019s reasonable determination\u201d necessitates that its\n\f                             44\n\u201cruling was not in accordance with the law\u201d and must be set\naside.

The measures were largely ineffective. In\nthe four years preceding the Act\u2019s adoption, more Americans\nwere killed at work than in the Vietnam War and the increasing\nhuman and economic cost of industrial hazards became a\nmatter of serious national concern.

For example, safety\nstandards promulgated pursuant to the Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 2036 (codified as amended at\n41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6501\u20136511), applied only to manufacturers and\nsuppliers operating under federal contracts, see 41 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 6502(4). Other labor laws similarly conditioned coverage on\nthe existence of a federal nexus. The Contract Work Hours and\nSafety Standards Act, 76 Stat. 357, amended by\u2014and\npopularly referred to as\u2014the Construction Safety Act of 1969\n(CSA), Pub. L. No. 91-54, 83 Stat. 96 (codified as amended at\n40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3704), authorizes the regulation of contractors and\nsubcontractors working on federally funded construction\nprojects, see 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3704(a)(1). These circumscribed\nscopes meant that, in a given industry, many workers remained\nunprotected even as others were covered by applicable federal\nstandards.\n\n     The OSH Act aimed to close this coverage gap by\nfacilitating the development of \u201cuniformly applied\u201d standards,\nS.

On the one hand, \u00a7 1910.5(c)(2) seemed to\ncontemplate that the general standards in Part 1910, i.e., those\nderived from Walsh-Healey standards, were meant to fill in\nregulatory gaps left by particular standards, like the\nconstruction standards prescribed in Subpart B. See 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1910.5(c)(2) (\u201c[A]ny standard shall apply according to its\nterms to any employment and place of employment in any\nindustry, even though particular standards are also prescribed\nfor the industry, . . . to the extent that none of such particular\nstandards applies.\u201d) (emphasis added). On the other hand,\n\u00a7 1910.5(e) appeared to foreclose such a broad application,\ndeclaring that any OSH standard derived from a Walsh-Healey\nstandard \u201cis intended to apply to manufacturing or supply\noperations which would be subject to the Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act if there were a Federal contract . . . involved.\u201d\nNational Consensus Standards and Established Federal\n\n\n     4\n        \u201cWhere the eyes or body of any person may be exposed to\ninjurious corrosive materials, suitable facilities for quick drenching\nor flushing of the eyes and body shall be provided within the work\narea for immediate emergency use.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.151(c).\n\f                               8\nStandards, 36 Fed.

See\nApplicability of Some Established Federal Standards, 36 Fed.\nReg. 18,080, 18,081 (Sept. 9, 1971).

Cir. 1987), but that is not the case here. The\narguments Kiewit complains of appear in the Secretary\u2019s\nprincipal brief, in substantially similar form. The real issue,\nthen, is that Kiewit disagrees with the Secretary\u2019s position. For\nexample, Kiewit claims the Secretary\u2019s reply brief added new\npoints on legislative history but the substance of its proposed\nrebuttal focuses solely on the Secretary\u2019s purported textual\nmischaracterizations.8 That the Secretary draws different\nconclusions from the underlying sources is insufficient to\njustify a rebuttal. And to the extent the Secretary adopted any\n\u201cnew\u201d positions, he was simply responding to contentions\nmade by Kiewit. This is the very nature of a reply brief. See,\ne.g., United States v. Van Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187226\"><a href=\"/opinion/187226/united-states-v-van-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 973 (D.C. Cir.\n2008). Nor has Kiewit demonstrated that rebuttal argument is\nwarranted to respond to several alleged misstatements in the\nSecretary\u2019s reply brief. Kiewit does not claim the offending\narguments were newly raised. Instead, it simply frames the\ninterpretive dispute as the basis for additional briefing.\n\n   Finally, Kiewit contends the Secretary\u2019s argument that we\nmay not distinguish cases on grounds not used by the\n\n    8\n         In fact, Kiewit has itself mischaracterized the alleged\nmischaracterizations. For example, it quotes language from the\nSecretary\u2019s brief, making much of the fact that the exact wording\ndoes not appear in any of the Secretary\u2019s cited sources. But Kiewit\nreferences the Secretary\u2019s own language\u2014it is entirely expected that\nthe Secretary\u2019s word choice differs from the sources he cites.\n\f                               20\nCommission is inconsistent with circuit precedent. This dispute\nis ultimately irrelevant to our disposition because we do not\ndecide the Secretary\u2019s arbitrary-and-capricious challenge. See\ninfra at 37. In any event, rebuttal briefing is unwarranted. The\nSecretary\u2019s argument was in response to Kiewit\u2014not the\nCommission\u2014so it could not have been raised earlier than the\nreply brief. Although Kiewit concedes it could raise the same\nobjections in a letter filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 28(j), it touts the fact that permitting a rebuttal\nargument will save ninety-two words. There are good reasons\nwhy this minute reduction, without more, does not justify a\ndeparture from the normal cross-briefing rules. In contrast to\nthe proposed rebuttal, the Secretary would have an opportunity\nto respond to a 28(j) letter. Allowing rebuttal argument on these\nfacts risks opening the door to any litigant that disagrees with\nthe opposing party\u2019s arguments to evade the standard briefing\nrequirements and gain the last word.

Kiewit has provided\nno evidence that the quick-drenching provision was debated at\nthis time\u2014just that the rest of \u00a7 50-204.6 informed the new\nCSA standard. Rather, it contends that the applicability of the\nWalsh-Healey standards to the construction industry, including\nthe quick-drenching provision, remained a topic of debate until\nthe 1993 codification of certain general standards as\nconstruction standards. But this contention is not inconsistent\nwith the Secretary\u2019s position that general standards apply if no\nparticular standard addresses the same hazard or working\ncondition. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.5(c)(1)\u2013(2); Incorporation of\nGeneral Industry Safety and Health Standards Applicable to\nConstruction Work, 58 Fed.

Simply\nbecause the extent of the coverage overlap between Walsh-\nHealey and CSA standards was not immediately apparent does\nnot mean that the former\u2019s extension to new industries\nnecessarily constituted a substantive modification.\n\n     That said, the line between substantive and non-\nsubstantive modification is not easy to discern. According to\nKiewit, \u201c[s]ubstantive modification means that one is not\nadopting the \u2018established Federal standard.\u2019\u201d Kiewit Br. 35\n(citing Usery v.

See\nOSHRC Decision at 1453 (section 6(a) allowed Secretary to\nexpand scope of Walsh-Healey standards \u201cto all manufacturers,\nnot just those with federal contracts\u201d); Kiewit Br. 38\n(\u201c[S]ubstantive change would not occur when the Walsh-\nHealey and Construction Safety standards . . . were extended to\nall manufacturers and constructors.\u201d). Kiewit and the\nCommission draw the line, however, at the extension to\nemployers in a different industry. But the language of the OSH\nAct does not plainly support this implicit limitation.\n\n     Granted, there are some colorable arguments that the scope\nof a new OSH standard promulgated under section 6(a) was\nintended to mirror that of its source standard. Established\nFederal standards encompass \u201cany operative [OSH] standard\nestablished by any agency of the United States and presently in\neffect.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(10). In turn, an OSH standard\n\u201crequires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more\npractices, means, methods, operations, or processes,\nreasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful\nemployment and places of employment.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> \u00a7 652(8). </span><pre class=\"inline\">Kiewit\ncontends that once a standard found to be \u201creasonably\n\f                                  26\nnecessary or appropriate\u201d for the protection of workers in a\nspecific industry is extended to additional industries, it is no\nlonger the same established Federal standard because no\nfinding has been made that the standard is in fact \u201creasonably\nnecessary or appropriate\u201d for the new \u201cemployment\u201d and\n\u201cplaces of employment.\u201d See Kiewit Br. 36\u201337. Accordingly,\nKiewit asserts that the Secretary cannot utilize section 6(a)\u2014\nwhich authorizes the promulgation of established Federal\nstandards \u201cpresently in effect\u201d\u2014to extend the quick-drenching\nstandard to the construction industry because he never found\nthe standard \u201creasonably necessary or appropriate\u201d to protect\nconstruction workers.11</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\n    At the </span><pre class=\"inline\">same time, the express limitations on the\nSecretary\u2019s section 6(a) authority suggest a more expansive\nscope for newly adopted OSH standards.

If\nadopting a Walsh-Healey standard as an OSH standard\nexpanded coverage to manufacturers and suppliers without\nfederal contracts only, it is difficult to imagine when such a\nstandard would not result in improved safety or health for the\nnewly covered employees inasmuch as, before the OSH Act,\nthey would not have been protected by any mandatory safety\nor health standards. Kiewit responds that the Secretary was not\nauthorized to modify a standard, only to refrain from adopting\nit.12 But this assertion does not explain when it would be\nappropriate to not adopt an established Federal standard, if the\nstandard continued to apply only in the industry for which it\nwas originally promulgated.

Because \u00a7 1910.11 is itself codified in Subpart B, the\nSecretary contends it is made operative, by its own terms, to all\nestablished Federal standards, including Walsh-Healey standards,\nthereby extending such standards to every employer covered by the\nOSH Act. Better read, \u00a7 1910.11 indicates that the industry specific\nstandards in Subpart B were not to retain the same coverage\nlimitations as their source standards but were to apply to additional\nemployers within the relevant industry.

These facts thus contrast sharply\nwith those in Encino Motorcars, where employers were told a\ndecades-long policy would be reflected in the revised\nregulation, only to have DOL inexplicably veer in the opposite\ndirection. Ironically, despite the Commission\u2019s invocation of\nreliance interests, its decision, not the Secretary\u2019s, invalidates\nan interpretation that has stood for nearly fifty years.\n\n     Moreover, it is a troubling proposition to withhold\ndeference based on the absence of formal rulemaking when, if\nthe Secretary correctly construed the boundaries of his section\n6(a) authority, it was proper for him to act without notice-and-\ncomment procedures.

It is undisputed that, for two years, the\nSecretary could issue OSH standards using section 6(a)\u2019s\ninformal procedure. Indeed, Kiewit does not contest the\nvalidity of other section 6(a) standards, all of which were\npromulgated without notice and comment or reasoned\nexplanation. The question, then, is whether the challenged\nstandards were required to carry over their source standards\u2019\nindustry-centric scopes. In answering, the Commission\u2019s view\non the merits of the Secretary\u2019s position fused with its\ndetermination that his interpretation was procedurally\ndefective, presuming the Secretary could not expand the scope\nof standards promulgated under section 6(a).

This argument \u201creflects a\nfundamental misunderstanding of OSHA\u2019s regulatory\nscheme,\u201d       which         contemplates      \u201cthat     standards\napply . . . wherever the working conditions and hazards\naddressed by the standard exist.\u201d Sec\u2019y\u2019s Br. 32 n.8. A standard\napplied to a specialized line of work is, by its terms, unlikely\nto apply in a different setting where the same risk does not\nexist. For example, a standard addressing a danger found only\nin the agricultural industry will not apply to work in a\nmanufacturing plant. But when the same hazardous\ncondition\u2014e.g., exposure to corrosive materials\u2014exists in\ndifferent industries, it is reasonable to apply a relevant standard\nacross industry lines. And the likelihood of absurd results is\nfurther mitigated by the approach outlined in \u00a7 1910.5(c),\nwhich contemplates that general industry standards apply only\nif a specific industry standard does not already address the\ncondition at issue.\n\n     True, cross-industry application may not be appropriate in\nall cases. The unique characteristics of an industry may make\nit infeasible for an employer to adopt a general standard,\nthereby requiring a different solution to abate the same hazard.\nIndeed, Kiewit asserts that applying the quick-drenching\nstandard to construction poses feasibility problems\u2014\nconstruction sites typically lack plumbing and frequent crew\nmovement requires the relocation of portable water containers.\nBut, in addition to the variance procedure set out in OSH Act\nsection 6(d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(d),16 if \u201cstrict compliance with a\n\n    16\n       \u201cAny affected employer may apply to the Secretary for a rule\nor order for a variance from a standard promulgated under [section\n\f                                  38\nstandard is physically impossible or would prevent\nperformance of the work, employers may instead take\nalternative protective measures,\u201d Am.

Tellingly, although the Commission recognizes an\naffirmative infeasibility defense, Kiewit has not alleged that it\nwas in fact infeasible to provide suitable quick-drenching\nfacilities here.\n\n     Kiewit next contends that extending the reach of standards\nissued under section 6(a) contravenes the procedural\nrequirements the Congress prescribed for the promulgation of\nnew construction standards. Its assertion that established\nFederal standards could not be made to apply to the\n\n6]. . . . The Secretary shall issue such rule or order if he determines\non the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate\nand a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices,\nmeans, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be\nused by an employer will provide employment and places of\nemployment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as\nthose which would prevail if he complied with the standard.\u201d 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 655(d).\n\f                               39\nconstruction industry absent formal rulemaking procedures is\nbased on language from the Conference Report, setting out the\nconferees\u2019 intent \u201cthat the Secretary develop health and safety\nstandards for construction workers . . . pursuant to the\nprovisions of [the CSA] and that he use the same mechanisms\n. . . for the development of health and safety standards for all\nthe other construction workers newly covered by [the OSH]\nAct.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 91-1765, at 33 (1970) (Conf. Rep.). But\nthe implication that the Secretary could adopt only those\nconstruction standards issued under the CSA is at odds with the\nlanguage of section 6(a), which authorizes the Secretary to\npromulgate \u201cany national consensus standard, and any\nestablished Federal standard\u201d as an OSH standard. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\n655(a) (emphases added). Indeed, under Kiewit\u2019s reading, the\nSecretary would have been unable to adopt any national\nconsensus standards for the construction industry because such\nstandards were not issued in accordance with CSA-mandated\nprocedures. See OSHRC Decision at 1465 (Attwood, Comm\u2019r,\ndissenting). This cannot be. Rather, the Conference Report\u2019s\nforward-looking language suggests the conferees were\nreferring to the development of new construction standards, not\nthe adoption of preexisting standards under section 6(a). A\ncontrary interpretation would exert incredible tension on\nsection 6(a)\u2019s plain language.\n\n     Kiewit also claims the OSH Act\u2019s legislative history\nevinces congressional intent to preserve established Federal\nstandards\u2019 industry-based limitations. It relies primarily on the\nReport of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare,\nwhich states that section 6(a) was designed \u201cto establish as\nrapidly as possible national occupational safety and health\nstandards with which industry is familiar.\u201d S. Rep. No. 91-\n1282, at 6 (emphasis added). That is, established Federal\nstandards \u201chave already been subjected to the procedural\nscrutiny mandated by the law under which they were issued.\u201d\n\f                                40</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n<span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Therefore, as </span><pre class=\"inline\">Kiewit sees it, the Secretary could not extend\nWalsh-Healey standards without rulemaking because the\nconstruction industry neither was familiar with those standards\nnor participated in their original promulgation. The\nCommission agreed, noting the construction industry would\nhave \u201chad no reason or incentive to participate in\u201d the\npromulgation of the Walsh-Healey standards \u201cbecause it was\nnot affected by the rulemaking,\u201d and that \u201c[d]epriving the\nconstruction industry of its \u2018opportunity to participate\u2019 in the\nrulemaking process is contrary to the OSH Act\u2019s language and\nintent.\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1450. This position is facially\nappealing but ultimately unavailing.\n\n     Despite the considerable ink spilled by the parties, the\nOSH Act\u2019s legislative history remains, at best, unilluminating.\nFirst, interested employers\u2019 participation is not dispositive. It is\nundisputed that the adoption of Walsh-Healey standards as\nOSH standards extended their protections to all manufacturers\nengaged in interstate commerce. However, the newly covered\nemployers\u2014those without federal contracts\u2014were not subject\nto the Walsh-Healey Act and therefore had no more reason to\nparticipate in rulemaking than the construction industry.\nGranted, at least some manufacturers were interested and may\nhave adequately represented the manufacturing industry at\nlarge but this was not a given. Cf. S. Rep. No. 91-1282, at 4\n(before standards became mandatory for all employers,\ninvesting in health and safety often put smaller employers at\n\u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d).

Indeed, the Secretary testified to the Senate\nSubcommittee on Labor that \u201cthe Walsh-Healey Public\nContracts Act and its companion legislation\u201d were \u201c[t]he only\nFederal [safety and health] laws not confined to a specific\nindustry.\u201d Occupational Safety and Health Act, 1970:\nHearings on S. 2193 and S. 2788 Before the Subcomm. on\nLabor of the S. Comm. on Labor & Public Welfare, 91st Cong.\n80 (1970) (statement of George P. Shultz, Secretary of Labor).\n\n     Our view of the legislative history is not altered by the fact\nthat the House of Representatives rejected a bill proposed by\nRepresentative Dominick Daniels, providing that any\nestablished Federal standard promulgated as an OSH standard\nwas \u201cnot limited to its present area of application,\u201d H.R. 16785,\n91st Cong. \u00a7 6 (as reported by H.

(1970). The Commission\ndeemed the adoption of the competing Steiger bill \u201cas further\nproof that Congress never intended [Walsh-Healey] standards\nto apply to construction employers.\u201d OSHRC Decision at 1453.\nThis conclusion is far too speculative. Even assuming \u201c[t]he\nvote to substitute was a vote on the Daniels bill,\u201d Kiewit Br. 44\n(citing Whirlpool Corp. v.

In contrast, the language setting the scope of\nestablished Federal standards was not mentioned during the\nfloor debates. It is therefore an immense leap to derive from the\nDaniels bill\u2019s failure any intent to reject a single phrase in a bill\nladen with controversial provisions. We decline the invitation\nto make this jump.\n\n     Even after considering Kiewit\u2019s myriad arguments made\nin dogged pursuit of its petition,17 whether the quick-drenching\nprovision was properly extended to the construction industry\nremains a question with no obvious answer. It is apparent from\nour efforts to untangle the mare\u2019s nest that is the OSH Act and\nits implementing regulations that the Congress intended some\nscope expansion for standards adopted under section 6(a). See\nS. Rep. No. 91-1282, at 6 (established Federal standards \u201cmay\nbe made applicable to additional employees who are not under\nthe protection of such other Federal laws\u201d). Otherwise, the new\nOSH standards would continue to cover only the limited swath\nof employers subject to preexisting labor laws.

Our careful review of the\nOSH Act\u2019s less-than-pellucid legislative history and the\nSecretary\u2019s frequently muddled regulatory efforts has not\nclarified matters. \u201cIf Congressional intent is unclear after\u201d\nanalyzing the statute and relevant legislative history, \u201cthen the\nreviewing court is called upon to determine whether the\nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018permissible,\u2019 that is to say\nreasonable.\u201d Inv.

Less than a year\n\f                                 2\nlater, the University terminated Waggel based on documented\ninstances of unprofessionalism and deficient performance.\nWaggel alleges the University violated the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) by failing to provide a reasonable\naccommodation and discriminating against her because of her\ncancer. Waggel further alleges the University retaliated against\nher and interfered with her rights under the Family and Medical\nLeave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). The district court granted summary\njudgment for the University on all claims. Because Waggel\nfailed to request an accommodation under the ADA and failed\nto rebut the University\u2019s legitimate justifications for its actions,\nwe affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n     Stephanie Waggel joined the George Washington\nUniversity Hospital for a four-year psychiatry residency\nprogram in July 2014. The residency program involves both\nclinical rotations under the supervision of attending physicians\nand academic coursework. To advance through each successive\nyear, a resident must satisfy the program\u2019s minimum\ncompetency and training requirements. Residents receive\nintensive feedback from their supervising physicians\nchanneled through the residency program\u2019s director, Dr. Lisa\nCatapano. From the beginning, Waggel\u2019s supervisors reported\nconcerns about her allegedly unprofessional conduct,\nresistance to feedback, and lack of clinical knowledge.\n\n     In April 2015, Waggel was diagnosed with a renal cyst\nlater confirmed to be stage one kidney cancer. Waggel suffered\nsignificant stress and anxiety from the diagnosis as well as\nphysical discomfort related to the cyst. During this period,\nWaggel\u2019s supervising physicians reported a decline in her\nperformance and in one instance sent Waggel home from a shift\nafter determining she was unfit to deliver patient care. After\n\f                               3\nthis incident, Waggel conferred with Dr. Catapano and\na University administrator about medical leave. Although the\nUniversity offered Waggel the option of seeking leave as an\nADA accommodation, Waggel ultimately took ordinary\nvacation days to travel within the United States and abroad. In\nJuly 2015, Waggel underwent an inpatient surgery that\nsuccessfully removed the cyst. Although the University\ngranted two weeks of medical leave, Waggel found it\nextremely difficult to arrange time off for surgery\nnotwithstanding the seriousness of her condition. Further,\ndespite approval for two weeks of light duty upon returning to\nwork, Waggel worked very long hours during this time,\nincluding shifts lasting more than twenty hours. For the\nremainder of her time in the program, Waggel needed to attend\nmedical appointments for follow-up cancer screenings,\ntreatment related to lingering physical symptoms, and therapy\nfor ongoing anxiety related to her diagnosis. Waggel often\nstruggled to secure time off and had to deal with supervisors\nwho sometimes kept her late when she had appointments and\ntold her to plan the appointments around the program\u2019s\nschedule.\n\n     In her second year in the residency program, Waggel\u2019s\nbehavior at work prompted several complaints by supervising\nphysicians to Dr. Catapano. In one incident, Waggel allegedly\nexhibited dangerous patterns of dealing with psychiatric\npatients by using methods of restraint contrary to University\npolicy. In several others, Waggel allegedly missed shifts or\nfailed to appropriately communicate patient status to other\nphysicians. Dr. Catapano interceded to notify Waggel of these\ndeficiencies and develop a plan to remedy shortfalls in training\nand performance. Waggel attributed the complaints in large\npart to her illness and believed the University was mistreating\nher because of her medical needs.\n\f                               4\n     In October 2015, Waggel\u2019s relationship with Dr. Catapano\nand other program leaders deteriorated further when she\nencountered difficulties scheduling leave for a mandatory\nlicensing exam. Although initially approved for a four-day\nadministrative leave, the University revised Waggel\u2019s leave to\ntwo days for the stated purpose of maintaining uniform\ntreatment with other residents. The program offered Waggel\nthe option of taking additional personal leave, but also noted\nthat further absences might cause her to work fewer than the\nminimum number of days required to complete the rotation.\nAfter an increasingly hostile email exchange with her\nsupervisors, Waggel announced the following day that she\nwould be taking two weeks of FMLA leave from program\nresponsibilities.\n\n     In November 2015, Waggel was placed on forced\nadministrative leave by Dr. Jeffrey Berger, the University\u2019s\nAssociate Dean for Graduate Medical Education, pending\ninvestigation into allegations about Waggel\u2019s behavior.\nAccording to several police and community reports, Waggel\nappeared publicly intoxicated at an apartment complex near the\nhospital, engaged in loud and disruptive conduct, and used\nabusive language toward observers. The University initially\nviewed these reports as raising concerns about Waggel\u2019s\nmental health and suitability for patient care. After discussing\nthe issue with Waggel, however, Dean Berger accepted\nWaggel\u2019s explanation that the incident arose from disputes\nwith a neighbor rather than a substance abuse problem. Several\nweeks later, the University determined Waggel was ineligible\nfor promotion to her third year in the program based on letters\nof deficiency she had accumulated over the previous year. In\naddition to describing instances of unprofessional conduct\nnoted above, the letters indicated Waggel had failed two\nrequired courses and neglected to complete other\nadministrative requirements.\n\f                                5\n\n     Throughout Spring 2016, Waggel engaged in a series of\ndiscussions with Dr. Catapano and Dean Berger about\nremedying her performance, getting back on track to complete\nthe program, and the possibility of transferring to a new\nresidency program. According to the University, Waggel\ndeclined to follow up on offers to remedy identified\ndeficiencies, threatened to bring legal action, and, in one\ninstance, attempted to attend a class for which she lacked\neligibility by misrepresenting her status to the instructor.\nAccording to Waggel, the University sought to burden her\ncareer by making it difficult to remedy her deficiencies,\ndeclining to provide specific feedback, and refusing to help her\ntransfer to another residency program. Waggel took a second\nround of FMLA leave, this time as intermittent leave, to attend\nmedical appointments in March.\n\n     In April 2016, a committee of supervising faculty voted\nunanimously to recommend dismissal, citing Waggel\u2019s letters\nof deficiency, a notice of unprofessional conduct related to her\neligibility misrepresentation, and additional concerns about her\nsuitability for patient care. This decision was adopted by\nDr. Catapano, sustained on independent review, and affirmed\non appeal by a senior University official.\n\n     After properly exhausting administrative remedies before\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Waggel filed\nsuit against the University for failure to accommodate her\ndisability and other disability discrimination under Title I of the\nADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111 et seq., as well as for retaliating\nagainst and interfering with her exercise of rights under the\nFMLA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq.1 The district court denied\n\n1\n Waggel also pled her ADA claims under the District of Columbia\nHuman Rights Act (\u201cDCHRA\u201d), D.C. CODE \u00a7 2\u20131401.01 et seq., and\n\f                                 6\nWaggel\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ADA claims\nand granted summary judgment to the University on all claims.\nWaggel v. George Washington Univ., No. 16-cv-1412, 2018\nWL 5886653 (D.D.C. Nov. 9, 2018); Waggel v. George\nWashington Univ., No. 16-cv-1412, 2018 WL 5893346\n(D.D.C. Nov. 9, 2018).\n\n     This timely appeal followed. We review grants of\nsummary judgment de novo, considering the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-prevailing party under the same\nstandards as the district court. See Stewart v. St. Elizabeths\nHosp., 589 F.3d 1305, 1307 (D.C. Cir. 2010). In doing so, we\ndo not \u201cweigh the evidence and determine the truth of the\nmatter\u201d but instead \u201cdetermine whether there is a genuine issue\nfor trial.\u201d Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 656 (2014) (quoting\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)).\n\n                                 II.\n\n    Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act requires\nemployers to make \u201creasonable accommodations to the known\nphysical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified\nindividual with a disability,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and\nmakes it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate against a qualified\nindividual on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 12112(a). Waggel\nclaims that the University failed to accommodate her disability,\n\nher FMLA claims under the District of Columbia Family and\nMedical Leave Act (\u201cDCFMLA\u201d), id. \u00a7 32\u2013501 et seq. Neither\nWaggel nor the district court noted material differences between the\nfederal and District of Columbia statutes, and we therefore treat the\nanalyses as identical for our purposes. See Giles v. Transit Emps.\nFed. Credit Union, 794 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (collapsing ADA\nand DCHRA inquiries); Alford v. Providence Hosp., 561 F. App\u2019x.\n13, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (unpublished judgment) (equating FMLA\nand DCFMLA inquiries).\n\f                               7\nnamely renal cancer, and furthermore discriminated against her\nbecause of this disability. The University responds that Waggel\nnever made a request for accommodation under the ADA and\nasserts legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for each alleged\nadverse employment action.\n\n                              A.\n\n     We turn first to Waggel\u2019s accommodation claim. To\nprevail on a reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201c(1) she was\na qualified individual with a disability, (2) the [employer] had\nnotice of her disability and (3) the [employer] denied her\nrequest for a reasonable accommodation.\u201d Ward v. McDonald,\n762 F.3d 24, 31 (D.C. Cir. 2014). We assume without deciding,\nas did the district court, that Waggel\u2019s renal cancer and the\nUniversity\u2019s awareness of her diagnosis satisfy Ward\u2019s first\nand second prongs. See Waggel, 2018 WL 5886653, at *3;\nWaggel, 2018 WL 5893346, at *6. Thus, Waggel\u2019s claim turns\non the third prong, which requires her to demonstrate both that\nshe requested a reasonable accommodation and that the request\nwas denied by the University. See Flemmings v. Howard Univ.,\n198 F.3d 857, 861 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (\u201cAn underlying\nassumption of any reasonable accommodation claim is that the\nplaintiff-employee has requested an accommodation which the\ndefendant-employer has denied.\u201d).\n\n     Waggel concedes that she never expressly requested an\nADA accommodation through the University\u2019s Office of Equal\nEmployment Opportunity (\u201cOEEO\u201d). The OEEO processes\nADA and FMLA requests confidentially and without\ninterference from an employee\u2019s direct supervisors. Medical\nresidents receive notice of the OEEO process in the resident\nmanual, which details the ADA\u2019s protections and lists contact\ninformation for the OEEO. Further, after Waggel discussed\n\f                               8\nmedical leave options with Dr. Catapano in May 2015, a leave\nadministrator followed up by email to notify Waggel of FMLA\neligibility requirements and to encourage her to contact the\nOEEO \u201c[i]f you believe you are a qualified individual with\na disability and would like to request a reasonable\naccommodation (such as medical leave) under the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act.\u201d Email from Kimberly Vanlewen, Leave\nof Absence Program Administrator, to Dr. Stephanie Waggel\n(May 18, 2015). The email further stated that \u201cADA leave\nwould provide similar job protections as FMLA so it is\nrecommended that you apply.\u201d Id. Although Waggel visited the\nOEEO in September 2015, the record contains no evidence she\nsought assistance from OEEO staff pertaining to an ADA\naccommodation or submitted forms to initiate the University\u2019s\naccommodation process. Waggel inquired only about \u201cpolicies\nto protect residents who needed time off for medical leave,\u201d\nand OEEO staff responded reasonably by providing\ninformation about FMLA leave. Decl. of Dr. Stephanie Waggel\n\u00b6 98 (Feb. 1, 2018) (\u201cWaggel Decl.\u201d).\n\n     Waggel argues her individual requests for time off to\nattend medical appointments amounted to a request for\naccommodation under the ADA notwithstanding her failure to\nask for an accommodation. In Flemmings, however, we held\nthat a request for a medical leave of absence standing alone was\ninsufficient to make out a request for accommodation. See 198\nF.3d at 861\u201362. Similarly, in Chenari v. George Washington\nUniversity, we \u201cdoubt[ed]\u201d that, notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s\nconcession he never utilized the University\u2019s formal process\nfor requesting ADA accommodation, his repeated notifications\nto the University of his ADHD made his \u201cneed for an\naccommodation \u2026 so apparent that the defendant must [have]\noffer[ed] one.\u201d 847 F.3d 740, 748 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n\f                                9\n      Relatedly, Waggel also claims that the \u201cobvious\nproblems\u201d associated with her cancer diagnosis required the\nUniversity to offer an accommodation in the absence of a valid\nrequest. Although we have assumed that the University had\nnotice of her disability, Waggel argues that the problems\narising from her disability\u2014scheduling difficulties, serious\nanxiety, and perceived unprofessional conduct, for example\u2014\nobligated the University to offer an accommodation. To be\nsure, in Chenari we recognized that \u201cthere may well be cases\nwhere the plaintiff\u2019s need for an accommodation is so apparent\nthat the defendant must offer one regardless of whether the\nplaintiff requested it.\u201d Id. (citing Pierce v. District of\nColumbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d 250, 269\u201370 (D.D.C. 2015)). But\nthis is not such a case. Notice of a disability does not ordinarily\nsatisfy the ADA\u2019s request requirement, which performs the\nindependent function of informing an employer of the\nlimitations imposed by a disability and the nature of the\naccommodation needed to remedy those limitations. See, e.g.,\nWindham v. Harris Cty., 875 F.3d 229, 238 (5th Cir. 2017)\n(\u201c[K]nowledge of a disability is different from knowledge of\nthe resulting limitation. And it certainly is different from\nknowledge of the necessary accommodation.\u201d). Here, the\nconnection between Waggel\u2019s disability and her performance\ndifficulties was not obvious. As noted above, \u201c[a]n underlying\nassumption of any reasonable accommodation claim is that the\nplaintiff-employee has requested an accommodation which the\ndefendant-employer has denied.\u201d Flemmings, 198 F.3d at 861.\n\n     Finally, we reject Waggel\u2019s argument that her requests for\nFMLA leave should have been construed as requests for an\nADA accommodation. Waggel cites no provision in the text of\neither statute that contemplates such an equivalency, and the\nstructure of the statutes are fundamentally different. The\nFMLA guarantees leave to \u201celigible employee[s]\u201d who have\nworked at their place of employment for a minimum length of\n\f                                10\ntime. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2611(2), 2612(a)(1). Moreover, under the\nFMLA, a person may take leave to assist a family member. See\nid. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(A)\u2013(C), (E). By contrast, Title I of the ADA\napplies to \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d with disabilities. 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). The scope of entitlements under the\nADA includes a range of reasonable accommodations while the\nFMLA authorizes only leave. Compare id. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(9),\n12112(b)(5)(A), with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1). The ADA, but\nnot the FMLA, requires exhaustion of administrative remedies\nbefore filing suit. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), 12117(a).\nFinally, the Department of Labor\u2019s implementing regulations\nemphasize claims under each statute must be analyzed\nseparately while acknowledging accommodations may\nsometimes overlap. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.702(b) (noting the\n\u201cADA\u2019s \u2018disability\u2019 and FMLA\u2019s \u2018serious health condition\u2019 are\ndifferent concepts, and must be analyzed separately\u201d); id.\n\u00a7 825.702(c)(2) (comparing ADA and FMLA entitlements).2\n\n     Waggel chose to seek leave under the FMLA rather than\nrequest accommodation under the ADA. The ADA respects\nindividual choices regarding whether and what type of\naccommodation to seek. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12201(d) (\u201cNothing\nin this chapter shall be construed to require an individual with\na disability to accept an accommodation, aid, service,\nopportunity, or benefit which such individual chooses not to\naccept.\u201d). Here, Waggel concedes she did not seek an ADA\n\n2\n  Waggel urges us to adopt the reasoning in Capps v. Mondelez\nGlobal, LLC, 847 F.3d 144 (3d Cir. 2017), which she argues equates\nFMLA and ADA requests. We read Capps more modestly as noting\nthat a request can trigger both the FMLA and the ADA through\nlanguage that independently satisfies the requirements of both\nstatutes. See id. at 156\u201357 (\u201c[A] request for FMLA leave may\nqualify, under certain circumstances, as a request for a reasonable\naccommodation under the ADA.\u201d (citing 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 825.702(c)(2))).\n\f                               11\naccommodation through established channels, and under the\ncircumstances this choice means no issues of material fact\nremain as to her reasonable accommodation claim.\n\n                               B.\n\n     We turn next to Waggel\u2019s remaining ADA discrimination\nclaims. \u201c[T]he two basic elements of a disability discrimination\nclaim are that (i) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment\naction (ii) because of the plaintiff\u2019s disability.\u201d Adeyemi v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 525 F.3d 1222, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\nWhen an employer asserts legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nreasons for an adverse employment action, we ask \u201cwhether the\nplaintiff produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to\nfind that the employer\u2019s asserted non-discriminatory reason\nwas not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally\ndiscriminated against the plaintiff on a prohibited basis.\u201d Id. To\nprevail on her discrimination claim, Waggel must point to\nevidence tending to show the University\u2019s justifications for one\nor more adverse employment actions are pretextual.\n\n     The breadth and variety of discriminatory actions alleged\nin Waggel\u2019s complaint led the district court to analyze them\ncategorically. See Waggel, 2018 WL 5886653, at *8\u201311;\nWaggel, 2018 WL 5893346, at *9\u201324. Waggel frames dozens\nof actions taken by the University during her two years in the\nprogram as circumstantial evidence of intentional\ndiscrimination through decisions on promotion, termination,\njob assignment, vacation time, training, and eligibility for\ntransfer to another program. The University explains each\ndecision by pointing to legitimate, non-discriminatory\nrationales embedded in documented reports from supervisors,\nletters of deficiency, and minutes from the meetings at which\nprogram leaders determined Waggel\u2019s status in the program.\n\f                              12\n     Waggel fails to demonstrate the University took adverse\nemployment actions against her \u201cbecause of\u201d her disability.\nAdeyemi, 525 F.3d at 1226. Take, for example, Waggel\u2019s claim\nthat program leaders discriminated against her by reducing her\nadministrative leave allotment for the October 2015 licensing\nexam. The University explains it reduced Waggel\u2019s leave to\ncorrect a clerical mistake: residents are allowed only two days\nof administrative leave for the exam, but administrators had\nmistakenly approved Waggel for four administrative days.\nWaggel points to no direct or circumstantial evidence rebutting\nthe University\u2019s explanation and offers no reason to link the\nreduction in leave to her disability. The University here\narticulated a legitimate interest in following its policies and\nensuring equal treatment of similarly situated employees.\n\n     Waggel was also unable to rebut the University\u2019s\nnondiscriminatory rationale for her termination. The faculty\ncommittee voted unanimously to dismiss Waggel based on\nmany documented instances in which she fell short of the\nprogram\u2019s professional and academic requirements. This\nsuffices as \u201ca legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the\nUniversity\u2019s action. Figueroa v. Pompeo, 923 F.3d 1078, 1087\n(D.C. Cir. 2019). Moreover, the University also provided\nWaggel with an independent review and appeals process before\nterminating her employment. Although there was some\ndisagreement within the University regarding the extent to\nwhich her cancer diagnosis should have been a mitigating\nfactor in the University\u2019s decision, Waggel cites no evidence\ncapable of rebutting the University\u2019s affirmative reasons\njustifying termination.\n\n     In addition, Waggel fails to identify sufficient evidence\nthat Dean Berger used troubling police and community reports\nabout her behavior as a pretext to place her on forced\nadministrative leave in November 2015. Waggel\u2019s evidence of\n\f                               13\npretext is the allegation that Dr. Catapano told her over the\nphone that the University disciplined her because she had taken\n\u201ctoo much sick leave,\u201d a comment Waggel interpreted as\nrelating to her disability. Waggel Decl. \u00b6 136. The district court\nnoted Dean Berger, not Dr. Catapano, was the decisionmaker\nregarding forced leave, and concluded Dr. Catapano\u2019s \u201cstray\ncomment\u201d was insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material\nfact regarding pretext. Waggel, 2018 WL 5893346, at *28\u201330\n(evaluating comment as possible evidence for Waggel\u2019s FMLA\nretaliation claims). Our cases recognize that stray remarks by\nnon-decisionmakers are not generally direct evidence of\ndiscrimination. See Adeyemi, 525 F.3d at 1229 (discounting\ncomments made with respect to disabled employee by non-\ndecisionmaker). However, the \u201cactions of a discriminatory\nsupervisor that feed into and causally influence the\ndecisionmaker\u2019s ultimate determination\u201d may establish\na discrimination claim if sufficiently influential in the ultimate\ndecision. Steele v. Mattis, 899 F.3d 943, 950 (D.C. Cir. 2018).\nHere, Dean Berger consulted Dr. Catapano before making his\nultimate decision on forced administrative leave. See Decl. of\nDr. Lisa Catapano \u00b6\u00b6 572\u201383 (Jan. 2, 2018). But the \u201ctoo much\nsick leave\u201d comment falls short of direct evidence of\ndiscrimination because it does not establish bias without the\nneed for additional inference. Cf. Steele, 899 F.3d at 950\u201351.\nAs indirect evidence, the \u201ctoo much sick leave\u201d comment does\nnot establish bias sufficient to rebut the ample evidence that\nDean Berger placed Waggel on administrative leave for\nnondiscriminatory reasons.\n\n     Waggel\u2019s submission \u201cboils down to the proposition that\ndiscrimination plaintiffs should receive jury trials as a matter\nof course.\u201d Vatel v. All. of Auto. Mfrs., 627 F.3d 1245, 1249\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \u201cBut that is not the way the law has\ndeveloped.\u201d Id. The district court correctly awarded summary\njudgment to the University because Waggel failed to identify\n\f                              14\nevidence allowing a reasonable jury to conclude her employer\ndiscriminated against her because of her disability.\n\n                             III.\n\n     Waggel asserts retaliation and interference claims under\nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, which guarantees leave to\ncovered employees for, among other purposes, \u201ca serious\nhealth condition that makes the employee unable to perform the\nfunctions of the position of such employee.\u201d 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). Employers may not \u201cinterfere with, restrain,\nor deny the exercise\u201d of FMLA rights, id. \u00a7 2615(a)(1), or\n\u201cdiscriminate against any individual for opposing any practice\nmade unlawful by this subchapter,\u201d id. \u00a7 2615(a)(2). As\nrelevant here, a plaintiff may bring retaliation claims under\n\u00a7 2615(a)(1) by alleging an employer discriminated against her\nfor taking FMLA leave. Gordon v. U.S. Capitol Police, 778\nF.3d 158, 161 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Gleklen v. Democratic\nCong. Campaign Comm., Inc., 199 F.3d 1365, 1367\u201368 (D.C.\nCir. 2000)). And, of course, a plaintiff may bring interference\nclaims under \u00a7 2615(a)(1) as well. Id. at 164 (citing McFadden\nv. Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll, LLP, 611 F.3d 1, 6\n(D.C. Cir. 2010)).\n\n                              A.\n\n     Waggel alleges the University retaliated against her for\ntaking medical leave in October 2015 and March 2016.\nAlthough her complaint did not specify which provision of 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a) was allegedly violated, we understand her\nallegations to arise under \u00a7 2615(a)(1) because her retaliation\ntheories relate primarily to the University\u2019s reaction to her\ndecisions to take FMLA leave rather than her opposition to the\n\f                                  15\nUniversity\u2019s leave policies.3 We evaluate FMLA retaliation\nclaims under the McDonnell Douglas framework. See Gleklen,\n199 F.3d at 1367. To establish a prima facie case of FMLA\nretaliation, a plaintiff must show (1) the exercise of protected\nFMLA activity; (2) an adverse employment decision; and (3)\na causal connection between the protected activity and the\nadverse action. See id. at 1368. Employers may rebut a prima\nfacie case by putting forward evidence of a legitimate, non-\nretaliatory reason for the adverse action. See id. The plaintiff\nmust identify evidence of pretext in order to overcome the\nemployer\u2019s rebuttal and survive summary judgment. See id.\n(citing Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1289\n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc)).\n\n     Many of Waggel\u2019s retaliation allegations fail to satisfy one\nor more elements of the prima facie case. For example, Waggel\nalleges the University caused her to miss an appointment with\nher therapist in November 2015 by denying her additional time\noff. But the record notes only that she \u201ccould not leave work,\u201d\nWaggel Decl. \u00b6 136, and Waggel alleges no specific adverse\ndecision by the University or a causal connection between the\naction and her earlier FMLA leave. Further, Waggel alleges the\nUniversity retaliated against her for appealing the faculty\u2019s\ndecision that she repeat certain coursework. But this allegation,\n\n3\n  The district court interpreted Waggel\u2019s retaliation claims as arising\nunder 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(2), which requires a plaintiff demonstrate\nshe opposed an employer practice that violated the FMLA. See\nWaggel, 2018 WL 5893346 at *25. Because we interpret her claims\nas arising under \u00a7 2615(a)(1), we need not decide whether Waggel\n\u201coppos[ed] any practice\u201d to determine whether the district court\nproperly granted summary judgment on the retaliation claims. See\nGordon, 778 F.3d at 162 (\u201c[W]e need not resolve the adequacy of\nher claim under \u00a7 2615(a)(2) because [the plaintiff] also advances\nher retaliation claim under \u00a7 2615(a)(1), which contains no\nrequirement that she \u2018oppose any practice.\u2019\u201d).\n\f                               16\ntoo, fails to draw a causal connection between the alleged\nretaliatory actions and her exercise of FMLA rights.\n\n     Another set of Waggel\u2019s allegations plausibly state\na prima facie case but fail to rebut the University\u2019s legitimate,\nnonretaliatory explanations. See Gleklen, 199 F.3d at 1368\n(affirming summary judgment where plaintiff \u201cfell far short of\nrebutting the [employer\u2019s] more plausible explanation for its\nactions\u201d). For instance, Waggel claims the temporal proximity\nbetween her October 2015 FMLA leave and the University\u2019s\ndecision to make her repeat certain coursework demonstrates\nthe decision was retaliatory. As we have noted before, timing\ncan help to establish the causal element of a prima facie case\nof retaliation. See id. (\u201cTemporal proximity is often found\nsufficient to establish the requisite causal connection for such\nclaims.\u201d). But the University explained its decision by pointing\nto Waggel\u2019s poor exam performance and distracting in-class\nbehavior. While timing can establish a prima facie case of\nretaliation, dislodging an employer\u2019s nonretaliatory\nexplanation as pretextual at the third step of McDonnell\nDouglas requires \u201cpositive evidence beyond mere proximity.\u201d\nMinter v. District of Columbia, 809 F.3d 66, 71\u201372 (D.C. Cir.\n2015) (quoting Solomon v. Vilsack, 763 F.3d 1, 16 (D.C. Cir.\n2014)).\n\n     On appeal, Waggel highlights one claim for which she\npoints to more than proximity to rebut the University\u2019s\nexplanation. Reframing her November 2015 forced\nadministrative leave discrimination claim as an FMLA\nretaliation claim, Waggel argues Dr. Catapano\u2019s comment that\nshe had \u201ctaken too much sick leave\u201d rebuts the University\u2019s\nexplanation as pretextual. Waggel Decl. \u00b6 136. But as discussed\nabove, this comment is not enough to overcome the\nUniversity\u2019s justification and raise a genuine issue of material\nfact. Thus, the district court was correct to find the University\n\f                              17\nentitled to summary judgment on Waggel\u2019s FMLA retaliation\nclaims.\n\n                              B.\n\n     Waggel also claims the University interfered with her\nFMLA rights in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(1). To prevail\non an FMLA interference claim, a plaintiff must show (1)\nemployer conduct that reasonably tends to interfere with,\nrestrain, or deny the exercise of FMLA rights, and (2) prejudice\narising from the interference. See Gordon, 778 F.3d at 164\u201365;\nMcFadden, 611 F.3d at 7 (citing Ragsdale v. Wolverine World\nWide Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89 (2002)).\n\n     Although Waggel raised several claims of interference\nbelow, see Waggel, 2018 WL 5893346, at *33\u201335, she presses\nonly one on appeal: that the University discouraged her from\nretaining an attorney to represent her interests. In support of\nthis allegation, Waggel cites an email from Dean Berger\nstating: \u201cPlease do not reference your attorney going forward,\nparticularly to the people in your Department. It does not make\nfor a safe working environment. It is your choice to continue to\npursue this avenue.\u201d Email from Dr. Jeffrey Berger, Associate\nDean for Graduate Medical Education, to Dr. Stephanie\nWaggel (Nov. 19, 2015). Further, Waggel points to\na subsequent comment by Dean Berger during a meeting she\nsecretly recorded that \u201che could not treat me the same way as\nothers because I had legal representation.\u201d Waggel Decl. \u00b6 212.\n\n     As an initial matter, Waggel cites no authority suggesting\nher retention of an attorney constituted protected FMLA\nactivity under these circumstances. The FMLA protects an\nemployee\u2019s rights to take guaranteed leave, oppose or complain\nabout an employer practice made unlawful by the statute, and\nparticipate in \u201clegal proceedings or inquiries relating to an\n\f                               18\nemployee\u2019s rights.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.220(a). To fall under the\nFMLA\u2019s protection, Waggel must show she retained her\nattorney to oppose or complain about unlawful activity,\nnamely, the University\u2019s alleged retaliation for her FMLA\nleave in October 2015. But the record shows Dean Berger\u2019s\nemail was responding to Waggel\u2019s statement that she had\nretained an attorney to pursue the goal of \u201cgraduat[ing] on\ntime.\u201d Email from Dr. Stephanie Waggel to Dr. Lisa Catapano,\nResidency Training Program Director, and Dr. Jeffrey Berger,\nAssociate Dean for Graduate Medical Education (Nov. 18,\n2015). Further, the transcript of Waggel\u2019s recorded meeting\nwith Dean Berger shows the two were discussing the\nUniversity\u2019s internal procedures and support systems with no\nrelation to FMLA leave or other protected activity. Tr.\nInterview between Dr. Jeffrey Berger, Associate Dean for\nGraduate Medical Education, and Dr. Stephanie Waggel 31\u201337\n(Mar. 17, 2016).\n\n     Even if we were to assume her activity falls under the\nprotection of the FMLA, a reasonable employee could not be\ndiscouraged from exercising FMLA rights by the innocuous\ncomments at issue here. Drawing all inferences in Waggel\u2019s\nfavor, Dean Berger\u2019s comments merely suggest something that\nis both plausible and lawful: Waggel\u2019s retention of an attorney\nprompted the University to become more cautious in\ncommunicating with her. Without more, an employer\u2019s\nstatements mentioning the lawful consequences of initiating\nlitigation and asking an employee to refrain from threats do not\nrun afoul of the FMLA\u2019s prohibition on interference.\n\n     Finally, Waggel fails to identify evidence of prejudice\narising \u201cby reason of the violation\u201d or \u201cas a direct result of the\nviolation.\u201d Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89 (quoting 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(II)). Remedies for FMLA interference\nclaims are \u201ctailored to the harm suffered.\u201d Id. In Gordon, for\n\f                                 19\ninstance, we found a plaintiff adequately alleged prejudice in\nthe form of documented monetary losses and harm to future\ncareer prospects. 778 F.3d at 166. In the absence of any similar\nallegations of prejudice arising specifically from\nDean Berger\u2019s comments, Waggel\u2019s claim necessarily fails.\nThe University was entitled to summary judgment on Waggel\u2019s\ninterference claims.4\n\n                               ***\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the University is affirmed.\n\n                                                        So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Because the University\u2019s summary judgment motion failed to cite\nto the record as to Waggel\u2019s FMLA claims, the district court\nexercised its discretion to consider the motion based on the court\u2019s\nown review of the record under FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e)(3). Waggel,\n2018 WL 5893346, at *27. Waggel argues the district court abused\nits discretion by cherry picking evidence unfavorable to her case. We\ndisagree. While Rule 56(c) provides that the court \u201cneed consider\nonly the cited materials,\u201d Rule 56(e)(3) grants district courts\ndiscretion to go beyond facts cited by the moving party. There is no\nabuse of discretion so long as the movant successfully shifted the\nburden of production and the court views the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); cf. Winston & Strawn, LLP v. McLean,\n843 F.3d 503, 507 (D.C.

Less than a year\n\f                                 2\nlater, the University terminated Waggel based on documented\ninstances of unprofessionalism and deficient performance.\nWaggel alleges the University violated the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) by failing to provide a reasonable\naccommodation and discriminating against her because of her\ncancer. Waggel further alleges the University retaliated against\nher and interfered with her rights under the Family and Medical\nLeave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). The district court granted summary\njudgment for the University on all claims. Because Waggel\nfailed to request an accommodation under the ADA and failed\nto rebut the University\u2019s legitimate justifications for its actions,\nwe affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n     Stephanie Waggel joined the George Washington\nUniversity Hospital for a four-year psychiatry residency\nprogram in July 2014. The residency program involves both\nclinical rotations under the supervision of attending physicians\nand academic coursework. To advance through each successive\nyear, a resident must satisfy the program\u2019s minimum\ncompetency and training requirements. Residents receive\nintensive feedback from their supervising physicians\nchanneled through the residency program\u2019s director, Dr. Lisa\nCatapano. From the beginning, Waggel\u2019s supervisors reported\nconcerns about her allegedly unprofessional conduct,\nresistance to feedback, and lack of clinical knowledge.\n\n     In April 2015, Waggel was diagnosed with a renal cyst\nlater confirmed to be stage one kidney cancer. Waggel suffered\nsignificant stress and anxiety from the diagnosis as well as\nphysical discomfort related to the cyst. During this period,\nWaggel\u2019s supervising physicians reported a decline in her\nperformance and in one instance sent Waggel home from a shift\nafter determining she was unfit to deliver patient care. After\n\f                               3\nthis incident, Waggel conferred with Dr. Catapano and\na University administrator about medical leave. Although the\nUniversity offered Waggel the option of seeking leave as an\nADA accommodation, Waggel ultimately took ordinary\nvacation days to travel within the United States and abroad. In\nJuly 2015, Waggel underwent an inpatient surgery that\nsuccessfully removed the cyst. Although the University\ngranted two weeks of medical leave, Waggel found it\nextremely difficult to arrange time off for surgery\nnotwithstanding the seriousness of her condition. Further,\ndespite approval for two weeks of light duty upon returning to\nwork, Waggel worked very long hours during this time,\nincluding shifts lasting more than twenty hours. For the\nremainder of her time in the program, Waggel needed to attend\nmedical appointments for follow-up cancer screenings,\ntreatment related to lingering physical symptoms, and therapy\nfor ongoing anxiety related to her diagnosis. Waggel often\nstruggled to secure time off and had to deal with supervisors\nwho sometimes kept her late when she had appointments and\ntold her to plan the appointments around the program\u2019s\nschedule.\n\n     In her second year in the residency program, Waggel\u2019s\nbehavior at work prompted several complaints by supervising\nphysicians to Dr. Catapano. In one incident, Waggel allegedly\nexhibited dangerous patterns of dealing with psychiatric\npatients by using methods of restraint contrary to University\npolicy. In several others, Waggel allegedly missed shifts or\nfailed to appropriately communicate patient status to other\nphysicians. Dr. Catapano interceded to notify Waggel of these\ndeficiencies and develop a plan to remedy shortfalls in training\nand performance. Waggel attributed the complaints in large\npart to her illness and believed the University was mistreating\nher because of her medical needs.\n\f                               4\n     In October 2015, Waggel\u2019s relationship with Dr. Catapano\nand other program leaders deteriorated further when she\nencountered difficulties scheduling leave for a mandatory\nlicensing exam. Although initially approved for a four-day\nadministrative leave, the University revised Waggel\u2019s leave to\ntwo days for the stated purpose of maintaining uniform\ntreatment with other residents. The program offered Waggel\nthe option of taking additional personal leave, but also noted\nthat further absences might cause her to work fewer than the\nminimum number of days required to complete the rotation.\nAfter an increasingly hostile email exchange with her\nsupervisors, Waggel announced the following day that she\nwould be taking two weeks of FMLA leave from program\nresponsibilities.\n\n     In November 2015, Waggel was placed on forced\nadministrative leave by Dr. Jeffrey Berger, the University\u2019s\nAssociate Dean for Graduate Medical Education, pending\ninvestigation into allegations about Waggel\u2019s behavior.\nAccording to several police and community reports, Waggel\nappeared publicly intoxicated at an apartment complex near the\nhospital, engaged in loud and disruptive conduct, and used\nabusive language toward observers. The University initially\nviewed these reports as raising concerns about Waggel\u2019s\nmental health and suitability for patient care. After discussing\nthe issue with Waggel, however, Dean Berger accepted\nWaggel\u2019s explanation that the incident arose from disputes\nwith a neighbor rather than a substance abuse problem. Several\nweeks later, the University determined Waggel was ineligible\nfor promotion to her third year in the program based on letters\nof deficiency she had accumulated over the previous year. In\naddition to describing instances of unprofessional conduct\nnoted above, the letters indicated Waggel had failed two\nrequired courses and neglected to complete other\nadministrative requirements.\n\f                                5\n\n     Throughout Spring 2016, Waggel engaged in a series of\ndiscussions with Dr. Catapano and Dean Berger about\nremedying her performance, getting back on track to complete\nthe program, and the possibility of transferring to a new\nresidency program. According to the University, Waggel\ndeclined to follow up on offers to remedy identified\ndeficiencies, threatened to bring legal action, and, in one\ninstance, attempted to attend a class for which she lacked\neligibility by misrepresenting her status to the instructor.\nAccording to Waggel, the University sought to burden her\ncareer by making it difficult to remedy her deficiencies,\ndeclining to provide specific feedback, and refusing to help her\ntransfer to another residency program. Waggel took a second\nround of FMLA leave, this time as intermittent leave, to attend\nmedical appointments in March.\n\n     In April 2016, a committee of supervising faculty voted\nunanimously to recommend dismissal, citing Waggel\u2019s letters\nof deficiency, a notice of unprofessional conduct related to her\neligibility misrepresentation, and additional concerns about her\nsuitability for patient care. This decision was adopted by\nDr. Catapano, sustained on independent review, and affirmed\non appeal by a senior University official.\n\n     After properly exhausting administrative remedies before\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Waggel filed\nsuit against the University for failure to accommodate her\ndisability and other disability discrimination under Title I of the\nADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111 et seq., as well as for retaliating\nagainst and interfering with her exercise of rights under the\nFMLA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq.1 The district court denied\n\n1\n Waggel also pled her ADA claims under the District of Columbia\nHuman Rights Act (\u201cDCHRA\u201d), D.C.

Thus, Waggel\u2019s claim turns\non the third prong, which requires her to demonstrate both that\nshe requested a reasonable accommodation and that the request\nwas denied by the University.

Although we have assumed that the University had\nnotice of her disability, Waggel argues that the problems\narising from her disability\u2014scheduling difficulties, serious\nanxiety, and perceived unprofessional conduct, for example\u2014\nobligated the University to offer an accommodation. To be\nsure, in Chenari we recognized that \u201cthere may well be cases\nwhere the plaintiff\u2019s need for an accommodation is so apparent\nthat the defendant must offer one regardless of whether the\nplaintiff requested it.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citing Pierce </span><pre class=\"inline\">v.

Notice of a disability does not ordinarily\nsatisfy the ADA\u2019s request requirement, which performs the\nindependent function of informing an employer of the\nlimitations imposed by a disability and the nature of the\naccommodation needed to remedy those limitations.

Waggel cites no provision in the text of\neither statute that contemplates such an equivalency, and the\nstructure of the statutes are fundamentally different. The\nFMLA guarantees leave to \u201celigible employee[s]\u201d who have\nworked at their place of employment for a minimum length of\n\f                                10\ntime. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2611(2), 2612(a)(1).

See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n<span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(A)\u2013(C), </span><pre class=\"inline\">(E). By contrast, Title I of the ADA\napplies to \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d with disabilities. 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). The scope of entitlements under the\nADA includes a range of reasonable accommodations while the\nFMLA authorizes only leave.

The University explains each\ndecision by pointing to legitimate, non-discriminatory\nrationales embedded in documented reports from supervisors,\nletters of deficiency, and minutes from the meetings at which\nprogram leaders determined Waggel\u2019s status in the program.\n\f                              12\n     Waggel fails to demonstrate the University took adverse\nemployment actions against her \u201cbecause of\u201d her disability.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187159\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Adeyemi,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/187159/adeyemi-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Take, for example, Waggel\u2019s claim\nthat program leaders discriminated against her by reducing her\nadministrative leave allotment for the October 2015 licensing\nexam. The University explains it reduced Waggel\u2019s leave to\ncorrect a clerical mistake: residents are allowed only two days\nof administrative leave for the exam, but administrators had\nmistakenly approved Waggel for four administrative days.\nWaggel points to no direct or circumstantial evidence rebutting\nthe University\u2019s explanation and offers no reason to link the\nreduction in leave to her disability. The University here\narticulated a legitimate interest in following its policies and\nensuring equal treatment of similarly situated employees.\n\n     Waggel was also unable to rebut the University\u2019s\nnondiscriminatory rationale for her termination. The faculty\ncommittee voted unanimously to dismiss Waggel based on\nmany documented instances in which she fell short of the\nprogram\u2019s professional and academic requirements.

Although there was some\ndisagreement within the University regarding the extent to\nwhich her cancer diagnosis should have been a mitigating\nfactor in the University\u2019s decision, Waggel cites no evidence\ncapable of rebutting the University\u2019s affirmative reasons\njustifying termination.\n\n     In addition, Waggel fails to identify sufficient evidence\nthat Dean Berger used troubling police and community reports\nabout her behavior as a pretext to place her on forced\nadministrative leave in November 2015. Waggel\u2019s evidence of\n\f                               13\npretext is the allegation that Dr. Catapano told her over the\nphone that the University disciplined her because she had taken\n\u201ctoo much sick leave,\u201d a comment Waggel interpreted as\nrelating to her disability.

For example, Waggel\nalleges the University caused her to miss an appointment with\nher therapist in November 2015 by denying her additional time\noff. But the record notes only that she \u201ccould not leave work,\u201d\nWaggel Decl. \u00b6 136, and Waggel alleges no specific adverse\ndecision by the University or a causal connection between the\naction and her earlier FMLA leave. Further, Waggel alleges the\nUniversity retaliated against her for appealing the faculty\u2019s\ndecision that she repeat certain coursework. But this allegation,\n\n3\n  The district court interpreted Waggel\u2019s retaliation claims as arising\nunder 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(2), which requires a plaintiff demonstrate\nshe opposed an employer practice that violated the FMLA.

Reframing her November 2015 forced\nadministrative leave discrimination claim as an FMLA\nretaliation claim, Waggel argues Dr. Catapano\u2019s comment that\nshe had \u201ctaken too much sick leave\u201d rebuts the University\u2019s\nexplanation as pretextual. Waggel Decl. \u00b6 136. But as discussed\nabove, this comment is not enough to overcome the\nUniversity\u2019s justification and raise a genuine issue of material\nfact. Thus, the district court was correct to find the University\n\f                              17\nentitled to summary judgment on Waggel\u2019s FMLA retaliation\nclaims.\n\n                              B.\n\n     Waggel also claims the University interfered with her\nFMLA rights in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(1). To prevail\non an FMLA interference claim, a plaintiff must show (1)\nemployer conduct that reasonably tends to interfere with,\nrestrain, or deny the exercise of FMLA rights, and (2) prejudice\narising from the interference.

In support of\nthis allegation, Waggel cites an email from Dean Berger\nstating: \u201cPlease do not reference your attorney going forward,\nparticularly to the people in your Department. It does not make\nfor a safe working environment. It is your choice to continue to\npursue this avenue.\u201d Email from Dr. Jeffrey Berger, Associate\nDean for Graduate Medical Education, to Dr. Stephanie\nWaggel (Nov. 19, 2015). Further, Waggel points to\na subsequent comment by Dean Berger during a meeting she\nsecretly recorded that \u201che could not treat me the same way as\nothers because I had legal representation.\u201d Waggel Decl. \u00b6 212.\n\n     As an initial matter, Waggel cites no authority suggesting\nher retention of an attorney constituted protected FMLA\nactivity under these circumstances. The FMLA protects an\nemployee\u2019s rights to take guaranteed leave, oppose or complain\nabout an employer practice made unlawful by the statute, and\nparticipate in \u201clegal proceedings or inquiries relating to an\n\f                               18\nemployee\u2019s rights.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.220(a). To fall under the\nFMLA\u2019s protection, Waggel must show she retained her\nattorney to oppose or complain about unlawful activity,\nnamely, the University\u2019s alleged retaliation for her FMLA\nleave in October 2015. But the record shows Dean Berger\u2019s\nemail was responding to Waggel\u2019s statement that she had\nretained an attorney to pursue the goal of \u201cgraduat[ing] on\ntime.\u201d Email from Dr. Stephanie Waggel to Dr. Lisa Catapano,\nResidency Training Program Director, and Dr. Jeffrey Berger,\nAssociate Dean for Graduate Medical Education (Nov. 18,\n2015). Further, the transcript of Waggel\u2019s recorded meeting\nwith Dean Berger shows the two were discussing the\nUniversity\u2019s internal procedures and support systems with no\nrelation to FMLA leave or other protected activity. Tr.\nInterview between Dr. Jeffrey Berger, Associate Dean for\nGraduate Medical Education, and Dr. Stephanie Waggel 31\u201337\n(Mar. 17, 2016).\n\n     Even if we were to assume her activity falls under the\nprotection of the FMLA, a reasonable employee could not be\ndiscouraged from exercising FMLA rights by the innocuous\ncomments at issue here. Drawing all inferences in Waggel\u2019s\nfavor, Dean Berger\u2019s comments merely suggest something that\nis both plausible and lawful: Waggel\u2019s retention of an attorney\nprompted the University to become more cautious in\ncommunicating with her. Without more, an employer\u2019s\nstatements mentioning the lawful consequences of initiating\nlitigation and asking an employee to refrain from threats do not\nrun afoul of the FMLA\u2019s prohibition on interference.\n\n     Finally, Waggel fails to identify evidence of prejudice\narising \u201cby reason of the violation\u201d or \u201cas a direct result of the\nviolation.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118488\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ragsdale,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118488/ragsdale-v-wolverine-world-wide-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">89</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(quoting 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(II)).

(doing business as\nFlyersRights.org) and its president. The first issue is whether\nthey \u2013 or one of them \u2013 have standing. If so, the second issue is\nwhether the Department of Transportation acted arbitrarily when\nit denied FlyersRights\u2019 request to begin a rulemaking dealing\nwith the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for\nInternational Carriage by Air, May 28, 1999, S. Treaty Doc. No.\n106-45 (entered into force Nov. 4, 2003).\n\n     This treaty, commonly known as the Montreal Convention,\nis the latest in a long series of international agreements\nregulating commercial air travel. One provision of the Montreal\nConvention imposes liability on air carriers for damages caused\nby passenger delay. Montreal Convention art. 19. Another\nrequires airlines to give \u201cwritten notice to passengers\u201d\nexplaining that the Convention may limit liability for \u201cdeath or\ninjury and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and\nfor delay.\u201d Montreal Convention art. 3(4).\n\n     FlyersRights, a non-profit organization, describes its\nmission as educating airline passengers of their rights and\nadvocating on their behalf. In its rulemaking request,\nFlyersRights claimed that airlines were not giving passengers\nsufficient notice of their right to compensation for delays in\nflights. FlyersRights urged the Transportation Department to\n\f                                  3\n\nissue regulations requiring the airlines to print written\nsummaries of passengers\u2019 rights on all international airline\ntickets, including information about how passengers suffering\nfrom flight delays might be compensated.\n\n     The Transportation Department denied the rulemaking\nrequest in a letter on February 1, 2019. The Department\nexplained that it did not have enough \u201cevidence that carriers are\nfailing to fulfill their notice obligations,\u201d and that it did not have\nenough evidence of \u201cconsumer confusion.\u201d The Department\nalso pointed out that another rulemaking proceeding had already\nbegun, a proceeding that touched upon the concerns\nFlyersRights had raised. The Department issued its final rule\nin that proceeding on April 16, 2019. See Elimination of\nObsolete Provisions and Correction of Outdated Statutory\nReferences in Aviation Economics Regulation, 84 Fed. Reg.\n15,920, 15,929\u201330 (Apr. 16, 2019). Under that rule, airlines are\nnow required to print written summaries of passengers\u2019 rights on\ninternational airline tickets, though those summaries do not\ninclude all of the information that FlyersRights requested in its\npetition. Id.\n\n     FlyersRights contends that the denial of its request for\nrulemaking was arbitrary in violation of the Administrative\nProcedure Act because the Transportation Department\ndisregarded significant evidence of airline deception and ignored\nevidence of consumer confusion.\n\n     This brings us to the threshold question of standing.\nFlyersRights sues not because of injury to itself, but to redress\ninjury to its \u201cmembers.\u201d The usual requirements for such\n\u201cassociational standing\u201d are that the organization demonstrate\nthat \u201c(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in\ntheir own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane\nto the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted\n\f                                4\n\nnor the relief requested requires the participation of individual\nmembers in the lawsuit.\u201d Hunt v. Wash. Apple Advert. Comm'n,\n432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). In mentioning organizations with\n\u201cmembers\u201d what comes to mind are common arrangements such\nas professional associations, labor unions, social clubs and the\nlike. But what if the organization asserting associational\nstanding does not have \u201cmembers\u201d of this sort?\n\n     The Supreme Court in Hunt held that \u201c[i]n determining\nwhether an organization that has no members in the traditional\nsense may nonetheless assert associational standing, the question\nis whether the organization is the functional equivalent of a\ntraditional membership organization.\u201d Fund Democracy, LLC\nv. SEC, 278 F.3d 21, 25 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n    FlyersRights is not \u201ca traditional membership organization\u201d\nand does not purport to be one. It claims that it nevertheless has\nstanding because it is suing on behalf of its \u201cmembers,\u201d or more\naccurately those individuals associated with the organization\nwho are the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of members. Hunt\nconsidered three criteria in determining whether the\n\u201cnonmembership organization\u201d sufficiently represented its\nconstituents\u2019 interests to be able to bring suit on their behalf.\nHunt\u2019s \u201cindicia of membership\u201d were these: whether the\nindividuals play a role in selecting the organization's leadership,\nin guiding the organization's activities, and in financing the\norganization's activities. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344\u201345; see also\nAm. Legal Found. v. FCC, 808 F.2d 84, 90 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\nRelying on this list, our court has held that readers of a\nmagazine were not members for associational standing purposes.\nSee Gettman v. DEA, 290 F.3d 430, 435 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\nViewers who merely watched the news regularly were not\nmembers of a media watchdog group for associational standing\npurposes. Am. Legal Found., 808 F.2d at 89\u201390.

Fund\nDemocracy, 278 F.3d at 25\u201326.\n\n     Even if the list of \u201cindicia\u201d identified in Hunt was meant to\nbe exhaustive \u2013 which is quite doubtful \u2013 we believe that\nFlyersRights is entitled to assert associational standing. Counsel\nfor the petitioners explained at oral argument that one becomes\na \u201cmember\u201d of FlyersRights by signing up to receive\ninformation from the organization. FlyersRights operates a\nhotline for airline passengers, run by the Board of Directors and\nstaffed by volunteers from the membership. (Hudson Supp.\nDecl. \u00b6 3). FlyersRights frequently polls its airline passenger\nmembers in order to determine which policy issues and types of\nactions FlyersRights will pursue on their behalf. (Hudson Supp.\nDecl. \u00b6 4). FlyersRights\u2019 leadership also considers the petitions\nmembers have signed when determining issues and policies to\npursue on their behalf. (Hudson Supp. Decl. \u00b6 5). The structure\nof the organization enables FlyersRights members to have direct\ninput, and member input guides the organization\u2019s activity.\n(Hudson Supp. Decl. \u00b6 4-5).              Further, a majority of\nFlyersRights\u2019 funding comes directly from its members, and\nmany of the organization\u2019s members have contributed some\namount of money to support FlyersRights\u2019 advocacy effort.\n(Hudson Supp. Decl. \u00b6 6).\n\n     Although the constituents of the organization do not elect\nthe leadership, the factors mentioned above indicate that there\nis a sufficient amount of interaction to influence the\norganization\u2019s activities. Cf. Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of\nCommerce, 928 F.3d 95, 101 (D.C. Cir. 2019), petition for cert.\nfiled, No. 19-777 (Dec. 16, 2019); see also Karl S. Coplan, Is\nVoting Necessary?

Other circuits have also concluded\nthat if an \u201corganization is sufficiently identified with and subject\n\f                                6\n\nto the influence of those it seeks to represent,\u201d it may assert\nassociational standing, even though it does not possess all three\nindicia of membership considered in Hunt.

See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343.\n\n     These conclusions do not end the standing inquiry.\nFlyersRights still must identify at least one member with\nindependent standing to sue the Department. See Warth v.\nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975). It puts forth two candidates.\nOne, Robert Lax, purportedly suffered an injury when his\nparents were affected by a flight cancellation and he was forced\nto spend time communicating with the airline about that\ncancellation. The Department contests Lax\u2019s standing on the\nground that he was not personally injured. The other, Leopold\nde Beer, claims to have suffered an injury when his own flight\nwas significantly delayed and the airline\u2019s inadequate notice\nregime hindered his ability to claim compensation. The\nDepartment does not challenge de Beer\u2019s standing, or his sworn\ndeclaration that he was personally delayed and would have been\neligible for compensation, but the inadequate notice regime left\nhim uninformed of his rights and impeded his ability to claim\nhis compensation. Thus, de Beer had standing to bring suit and\nso does FlyersRights.\n\n    As to the merits, FlyersRights claims that the Department\u2019s\ndenial of its petition for rulemaking was arbitrary and capricious\nbecause the Department\u2019s explanation was inadequate and\nlacked support in the record.\n\f                                 7\n\n     Under the Administrative Procedure Act, when an agency\ndenies a petition for rulemaking it is obligated to give notice and\nan explanation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(e). The explanation need not be\nexhaustive. All that is required is \u201ca brief statement of the\ngrounds for denial.\u201d Id. Because an agency\u2019s denial of a\npetition for rulemaking is akin to an exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion, judicial review is \u201climited\u201d and \u201cdeferential.\u201d\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 527\u201328 (2007) (quoting\nNat\u2019l Customs Brokers & Forwarders Ass\u2019n of Am., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 883 F.2d 93, 96 (D.C. Cir. 1989)). \u201c[A]n agency\nhas broad discretion to choose how best to marshal its limited\nresources and personnel to carry out its delegated\nresponsibilities\u201d and thus to determine its own regulatory\nagenda. Mass. v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 527.\n\n     Here, the Department adequately explained why it denied\nthe request for rulemaking. FlyersRights\u2019s petition for\nrulemaking presented two arguments in favor of a more robust\nnotice regime: that the airlines were not meeting their\nobligations under the Montreal Convention and that there was\nwidespread consumer confusion regarding passengers\u2019 rights to\ncompensation in the event of delay. The Department\u2019s\nexplanation responded to both of FlyersRights\u2019s concerns.\n\n     First, the Department found that airlines were fulfilling their\nobligations under the Montreal Convention. Specifically, it\nreviewed airlines\u2019 contracts of carriage and found that they gave\n\u201cadequate notice regarding the availability of compensation for\ndelays.\u201d      The Montreal Convention requires only that\n\u201cpassenger[s] shall be given written notice to the effect that\nwhere this Convention is applicable it governs and may limit the\nliability of carriers in respect of \u2026 delay.\u201d Montreal\nConvention, art. 3(4). The record includes the contracts of\ncarriage from several major airlines, each of which includes\nlanguage to that effect. This amply supports the Department\u2019s\n\f                                 8\n\nconclusion that the airlines have satisfied their notice obligations\nunder the Montreal Convention.\n\n     The Department\u2019s finding that there was insufficient\nevidence of consumer confusion to warrant a rulemaking was\nalso supported. FlyersRights presents some evidence of\nconsumer confusion, citing both its interactions with passengers\nand media reports. But the Department has \u201cbroad discretion to\nchoose how best to marshal its limited resources and personnel.\u201d\nMass. v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 527. Determining whether this\nquantum of evidence of consumer confusion \u2013 meaningful but\nnot overwhelming \u2013 warrants a rulemaking falls within the\nDepartment\u2019s discretion. The fact that the Department was\nalready engaged in a separate rulemaking process addressing\nmany of the concerns raised by FlyersRights further strengthens\nthe Department\u2019s position. See, e.g., Defenders of Wildlife v.\nGutierrez, 532 F.3d 913, 921 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n    The petition for judicial review is therefore denied.\n\n                                                      So ordered.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued December 11, 2019                 Decided May 5, 2020\n\n                         No. 19-1071\n\n FLYERS RIGHTS EDUCATION FUND, INC., DOING BUSINESS AS\n         FLYERSRIGHTS.ORG AND PAUL HUDSON,\n                    PETITIONERS\n\n                               v.\n\n  UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND\n                  ELAINE L.

(doing business as\nFlyersRights.org) and its president. The first issue is whether\nthey \u2013 or one of them \u2013 have standing. If so, the second issue is\nwhether the Department of Transportation acted arbitrarily when\nit denied FlyersRights\u2019 request to begin a rulemaking dealing\nwith the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for\nInternational Carriage by Air, May 28, 1999, S. Treaty Doc. No.\n106-45 (entered into force Nov. 4, 2003).\n\n     This treaty, commonly known as the Montreal Convention,\nis the latest in a long series of international agreements\nregulating commercial air travel. One provision of the Montreal\nConvention imposes liability on air carriers for damages caused\nby passenger delay. Montreal Convention art. 19. Another\nrequires airlines to give \u201cwritten notice to passengers\u201d\nexplaining that the Convention may limit liability for \u201cdeath or\ninjury and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and\nfor delay.\u201d Montreal Convention art. 3(4).\n\n     FlyersRights, a non-profit organization, describes its\nmission as educating airline passengers of their rights and\nadvocating on their behalf. In its rulemaking request,\nFlyersRights claimed that airlines were not giving passengers\nsufficient notice of their right to compensation for delays in\nflights. FlyersRights urged the Transportation Department to\n\f                                  3\n\nissue regulations requiring the airlines to print written\nsummaries of passengers\u2019 rights on all international airline\ntickets, including information about how passengers suffering\nfrom flight delays might be compensated.\n\n     The Transportation Department denied the rulemaking\nrequest in a letter on February 1, 2019. The Department\nexplained that it did not have enough \u201cevidence that carriers are\nfailing to fulfill their notice obligations,\u201d and that it did not have\nenough evidence of \u201cconsumer confusion.\u201d The Department\nalso pointed out that another rulemaking proceeding had already\nbegun, a proceeding that touched upon the concerns\nFlyersRights had raised. The Department issued its final rule\nin that proceeding on April 16, 2019.

FlyersRights\u2019s petition for\nrulemaking presented two arguments in favor of a more robust\nnotice regime: that the airlines were not meeting their\nobligations under the Montreal Convention and that there was\nwidespread consumer confusion regarding passengers\u2019 rights to\ncompensation in the event of delay. The Department\u2019s\nexplanation responded to both of FlyersRights\u2019s concerns.\n\n     First, the Department found that airlines were fulfilling their\nobligations under the Montreal Convention. Specifically, it\nreviewed airlines\u2019 contracts of carriage and found that they gave\n\u201cadequate notice regarding the availability of compensation for\ndelays.\u201d      The Montreal Convention requires only that\n\u201cpassenger[s] shall be given written notice to the effect that\nwhere this Convention is applicable it governs and may limit the\nliability of carriers in respect of \u2026 delay.\u201d Montreal\nConvention, art. 3(4). The record includes the contracts of\ncarriage from several major airlines, each of which includes\nlanguage to that effect. This amply supports the Department\u2019s\n\f                                 8\n\nconclusion that the airlines have satisfied their notice obligations\nunder the Montreal Convention.\n\n     The Department\u2019s finding that there was insufficient\nevidence of consumer confusion to warrant a rulemaking was\nalso supported. FlyersRights presents some evidence of\nconsumer confusion, citing both its interactions with passengers\nand media reports. But the Department has \u201cbroad discretion to\nchoose how best to marshal its limited resources and personnel.\u201d\nMass. v. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145749\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">EPA,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/145749/massachusetts-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Determining whether this\nquantum of evidence of consumer confusion \u2013 meaningful but\nnot overwhelming \u2013 warrants a rulemaking falls within the\nDepartment\u2019s discretion.

The Air Tour Management Act of 2000 directs the FAA\n\f                                2\n\nand NPS to \u201cmake every effort\u201d to establish rules governing\nsuch flights within two years of the first application. Although\napplications have been pending at twenty-five parks for nearly\ntwo decades, the agencies have fulfilled their statutory mandate\nat only two. Petitioners seek a writ of mandamus to compel the\nagencies to regulate air tours at seven parks where they have\ninjured members. Because the agencies have failed to timely\ndo so, we grant the petition.\n\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n     The Air Tour Management Act of 2000 requires vendors\nwho wish to conduct commercial air tours over certain national\nparks and tribal lands to first obtain a permit from the FAA. See\nPub. L. No. 106-181, \u00a7\u00a7 801-809, 114 Stat. 61, 185-94\n(codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128 and note). The Act\nprovides that the FAA, \u201cin cooperation with\u201d the NPS, \u201cshall\nestablish an air tour management plan . . . whenever a person\napplies for authority to conduct a commercial air tour\noperation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(b)(1)(A). Management plans\nmust go through notice and comment and comply with the\nNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). See id.\n\u00a7 40128(b)(2), (b)(4)(B). Management plans may \u201cprohibit\u201d\nair tours entirely or place certain conditions on them, such as\n\u201cmaximum or minimum altitudes,\u201d \u201ctime-of-day restrictions,\u201d\n\u201cmaximum number of flights per unit of time,\u201d and \u201cmitigation\nof noise, visual, or other impacts.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40128(b)(3)(A)-(B).\n\n     Congress directed the agencies to act with dispatch. The\nAct provides that the FAA \u201cshall make every effort to act on\n[an] application . . . and issue a decision . . . not later than 24\nmonths after it is received or amended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40128(a)(2)(E).\nBut because Congress recognized that this process couldn\u2019t be\n\f                               3\n\ncompleted overnight, the Act also allowed the FAA to grant\n\u201cinterim operating authority,\u201d id. \u00a7 40128(c)(1), (c)(3), to\nexisting tour operators so they \u201cwould not be put out of\nbusiness,\u201d Notice of Final Opinion on the Transferability of\nInterim Operating Authority Under the National Parks Air Tour\nManagement Act, 72 Fed. Reg. 6,802, 6,803 (Feb. 13, 2007).\n\n     The agencies\u2019 efforts to comply with the Act got off to a\npromising start. In 2000, they established the National Park\nOverflights Advisory Group, and by 2002, they had published\na rule defining \u201ccommercial air tour operations\u201d and launching\na permit application system. See National Parks Air Tour\nManagement, 67 Fed. Reg. 65,662 (Oct. 25, 2002). But trouble\nbegan to brew when the agencies started to respond to the\noperators\u2019 applications. Each agency prioritized different goals\nand sought to retain as much control over the process as\npossible. See Lusk Decl. \u00b6 45; Trevino Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-24. The\nFAA emphasized air traffic safety; the NPS, protecting park\nresources and visitor experience. As a result, the agencies\nbickered over everything from responsibility for making\ncertain NEPA determinations to the proper metric for\nmeasuring baseline noise levels. For example, the NPS \u201csought\nsole jurisdiction\u201d over environmental \u201cimpact determinations\non park resources,\u201d but the FAA refused to \u201cabdicat[e]\u201d its role\nin that process or defer to the \u201cpark superintendent\u2019s\nprofessional judgment.\u201d Lusk Decl. \u00b6 45. \u201cThe inability to\nresolve these issues\u201d often brought \u201cwork to a standstill.\u201d Id.\n\n     To be sure, the agencies kept busy. Despite their\ninfighting, they took steps to establish management plans at\nsixteen parks, holding stakeholder meetings, drafting\ndocuments, and conducting noise studies. But because the\nagencies \u201cwere never able to resolve a number\u201d of their\nsquabbles, id., they never got \u201cbeyond [the] initial stages of\nenvironmental review\u201d at any park, Gov\u2019t Br. 11, and \u201cnever\n\f                                4\n\nissued a draft [management plan or] NEPA document . . . for\npublic review and comment,\u201d Lusk Decl. \u00b6 45.\n\n      Twelve years passed, and the agencies still hadn\u2019t come up\nwith a single management plan. In an effort to speed things up,\nCongress amended the Act to exempt parks with fifty or fewer\nair tours per year and permit the agencies to enter into voluntary\nagreements in lieu of management plans. See FAA\nModernization and Reform Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-95,\n\u00a7 501, 126 Stat. 11, 100-03 (codified at 49 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 40128(b)(7)). Voluntary agreements are more flexible and\neasier to implement. The agencies need not jump through as\nmany procedural hoops to create them, as they aren\u2019t subject to\nNEPA and don\u2019t require full-dress notice and comment. 49\nU.S.C. \u00a7 40128(b)(7)(C). But there\u2019s a catch\u2014voluntary\nagreements must be, well, voluntary. Unlike management\nplans, voluntary agreements can\u2019t be imposed without operator\napproval. What\u2019s more, to substitute for a management plan,\nthe voluntary agreement must be unanimous; all operators\npossessing interim operating authority must sign on. Id.\n\u00a7 40128(b)(7)(A). A single holdout can force the agencies back\nto the drawing board.\n\n     After Congress amended the Act, the agencies agreed to\nput management plans on the back burner and focus their\nefforts on voluntary agreements. They anticipated that these\nagreements would be easier to complete, and they were right\u2014\nto some extent.\n\n     In 2015 and 2016, the agencies finalized voluntary\nagreements with the air tour operators at Big Cypress National\nPreserve and Biscayne National Park, bringing these parks into\ncompliance with the Act. But the statutory fix was no magic\nbullet. Getting air tour operators to sign on to voluntary\nagreements without the credible threat of a management plan\n\f                                 5\n\nproved difficult. Each operator gains a competitive advantage\nby hanging on to their (largely unregulated) interim authority\nwhile their rivals voluntarily accept restrictions. See Sauvajot\nDecl. \u00b6 7; Trevino Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. Unable to credibly threaten\nholdouts with the prospect of a stricter management plan, the\nagencies lack the necessary leverage to bring everyone to the\ntable. For example, although the agencies drafted partial\nagreements for Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and\nRainbow Bridge National Monument, those agreements don\u2019t\nyet pass muster under the Act because two of the nine operators\nhave refused to join. Still, the agencies have pressed on. They\nare currently working on voluntary agreements for Badlands\nNational Park and Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n\n                                 B\n\n     In 2018, Public Employees for Environmental\nResponsibility and the Hawaii Island Malama Pono\nCoalition\u2014organizations      representing   national    park\nemployees, visitors, and hiking guides\u2014filed a petition for a\nwrit of mandamus that would compel the agencies to establish\nmanagement plans or voluntary agreements within two years at\nseven parks: Bryce Canyon National Park, Glacier National\nPark, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Haleakala\nNational Park, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Lake Mead\nNational Recreation Area, and Muir Woods National\nMonument.* We dismissed that petition for lack of Article III\nstanding because it listed only the FAA as respondent and\n\n*\n  The agencies inform us that Muir Woods National Monument is\nnow exempt from the Act\u2019s requirements because it has fewer than\nfifty overflights per year and the NPS hasn\u2019t exercised its statutory\nauthority to withdraw that exemption. See Gov\u2019t 28(j) Letter (Dec.\n4, 2019); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(a)(5)(A)-(B). Thus, we do not include\nit in the relief afforded here.\n\f                               6\n\nPetitioners\u2019 injuries weren\u2019t redressable by the FAA alone. See\nIn re Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility, No. 18-1044 (D.C.\nCir. Nov. 13, 2018) (per curiam). Petitioners\u2019 new filing, which\nnames both the FAA and NPS as respondents, does not suffer\nfrom this jurisdictional defect.\n\n     In response to this litigation, the agencies produced a\nschedule for bringing into compliance one park named in the\npetition and six other parks. This plan sets target dates for\nestablishing voluntary agreements at Badlands National Park,\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park, Mount Rainier\nNational Park, and Mount Rushmore National Memorial,\nranging from January 31, 2020 to March 31, 2022. If the\nagencies can\u2019t produce unanimous voluntary agreements at\nthose parks within eighteen months, the plan calls for the\nagencies to develop management plans. The plan also calls for\nthe agencies to establish management plans at Death Valley\nNational Park, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and\nRainbow Bridge National Monument by May 31, 2022 at the\nlatest. The agencies have not offered a proposed timeline for\nPetitioners\u2019 other parks but pledge they will \u201cbegin preparatory\nwork in additional parks on a rolling basis.\u201d Savaujot Suppl.\nDecl. \u00b6 24.\n\n                               II\n\n    Before addressing the merits of the petition, we must first\nassess our jurisdiction.\n\n                               A\n\n     Our court has exclusive jurisdiction over mandamus\npetitions alleging unreasonable agency delay whenever a\nstatute commits review of the relevant action to the courts of\nappeals. See Telecomms. Research & Action Ctr. v. FCC\n\f                                 7\n\n(TRAC), 750 F.2d 70, 75 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (explaining that this\nstatutory commitment of review, \u201cread in conjunction with the\nAll Writs Act,\u201d gives this court jurisdiction); see also 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1651 (All Writs Act). The courts of appeals have exclusive\njurisdiction to review the FAA\u2019s management plans and\nvoluntary agreements, including any predicate environmental\ndeterminations by the NPS. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 40128(b)(5),\n46110(a); cf. City of Tacoma v. FERC, 460 F.3d 53, 76 (D.C.\nCir. 2006) (holding that a challenge to a FERC order gave us\njurisdiction to review a predicate biological opinion prepared\nby another agency). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction over this\nmandamus petition under the All Writs Act.\n\n                                 B\n\n     Petitioners assert associational standing to seek relief.\n\u201c[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its\nmembers when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing\nto sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are\ngermane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the\nclaim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation\nof individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d Hunt v. Wash. State\nApple Advert. Comm\u2019n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). The\nagencies do not dispute, and we agree, that Petitioners satisfy\nthe second and third elements. However, the agencies question\nwhether Petitioners satisfy the first element. They do.\n\n     To establish standing to sue in their own right, Petitioners\u2019\nmembers must show injury in fact, causation, and\nredressability. See Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S.\n149, 157-58 (2014). Petitioners\u2019 members include frequent\nhikers, whose enjoyment of the woods is marred by the\nintrusive noise of overflights. See, e.g., Contreras Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7;\nHingson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-9; Plakanis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-10. This is a\ncognizable aesthetic and recreational injury. See Friends of the\n\f                                 8\n\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167,\n183 (2000). It is caused by the agencies\u2019 failure to regulate air\ntours and could be redressed by a grant of mandamus relief.\n\n     The agencies raise two objections to redressability, but\nneither is persuasive. First, the agencies object that \u201cthere is no\nguarantee that air tour impacts would be reduced with the\nimplementation of plans or voluntary agreements.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br.\n18. But Petitioners need not show that relief is \u201ccertain,\u201d Int\u2019l\nLadies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union v. Donovan, 722 F.2d 795,\n811 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (internal quotation marks omitted), only\nthat it is \u201csubstantial[ly] likel[y],\u201d Vt. Agency of Nat. Res. v.\nU.S. ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771 (2000) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Management plans may prohibit air\ntours altogether or establish certain conditions, including noise\nmitigation, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(b)(3)(A)-(B), and plans \u201cshall\ninclude incentives . . . for the adoption of quiet aircraft\ntechnology,\u201d      id.    \u00a7 40128(b)(3)(D);      see     also     id.\n\u00a7 40128(b)(7)(B) (similar for voluntary agreements). Plans and\nagreements are thus substantially likely to mitigate the noise\nimpact of air tours.\n\n     Second, the agencies object that Petitioners\u2019 injuries aren\u2019t\nredressable because the agencies haven\u2019t violated a\nnondiscretionary duty, so mandamus relief is inappropriate.\nSee Gov\u2019t Br. 18-22. But that argument confuses standing with\nthe merits, which we address next. See Consol. Edison Co. of\nN.Y. v. Ashcroft, 286 F.3d 600, 604-06 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(finding standing but denying mandamus relief on the merits).\n\n                                III\n\n    \u201cOur consideration of any and all mandamus actions starts\nfrom the premise that issuance of the writ is an extraordinary\nremedy, reserved only for the most transparent violations of a\n\f                                9\n\nclear duty to act.\u201d In re Bluewater Network, 234 F.3d 1305,\n1315 (D.C. Cir. 2000). This is the rare case in which mandamus\nrelief is appropriate. For nineteen years, the agencies have\nfailed to comply with their statutory mandate despite\nCongress\u2019s command to \u201cmake every effort\u201d to do so within\ntwo years of an application. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(a)(2)(E). And\nthe agencies\u2019 latest proposed schedule is too little, too late. At\nsome point, promises are not enough; judicial intervention is\nneeded.\n\n                                A\n\n     Before granting mandamus relief, we must \u201csatisfy\nourselves that the agenc[ies] ha[ve] a duty to act.\u201d In re Am.\nRivers & Idaho Rivers United, 372 F.3d 413, 418 (D.C. Cir.\n2004). The agencies argue that they do not. In their view,\n\u201ccompletion of a management plan [or voluntary agreement] is\nnot a ministerial, clear-cut, or non-discretionary duty\u201d because\nthey must exercise their \u201cdiscretion\u201d over \u201cthe environmental\nanalyses and action [that they] will approve.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 20.\n\n     This argument confuses the creation of the plans with their\ncontent. While the latter may be discretionary, the former is\nnot. As the agencies concede, \u201cthe Air Tour Management Act\ngenerally requires [the] establishment of plans or voluntary\nagreements for non-exempt parks.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). The\nAct provides that the agencies \u201cshall establish an air tour\nmanagement plan . . . whenever a person applies for authority\nto conduct a commercial air tour operation.\u201d 49 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 40128(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). The agencies may not\nignore this clear command. Petitioners do not seek to control\nthe content of the plans; they \u201csimply seek[] to compel the\n[agencies] to make decisions within the statutory time frames.\u201d\n\f                              10\n\nAm.

That is an appropriate subject for mandamus relief.\n\n                              B\n\n    In evaluating a petition for mandamus relief based on\nunreasonable agency delay, we consider six factors:\n\n    (1) the time agencies take to make decisions must be\n    governed by a rule of reason; (2) where Congress has\n    provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with\n    which it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling\n    statute, that statutory scheme may supply content for this\n    rule of reason; (3) delays that might be reasonable in the\n    sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when\n    human health and welfare are at stake; (4) the court should\n    consider the effect of expediting delayed action on agency\n    activities of a higher or competing priority; (5) the court\n    should also take into account the nature and extent of the\n    interests prejudiced by delay; and (6) the court need not\n    find any impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude in\n    order to hold that agency action is unreasonably delayed.\n\nTRAC, 750 F.2d at 80 (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). No one factor is determinative, and \u201c[e]ach case must\nbe analyzed according to its own unique circumstances.\u201d Air\nLine Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 750 F.2d 81,\n86 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Our analysis of the six TRAC factors\nconvinces us mandamus relief is warranted.\n\n                              1\n\n   The majority of the TRAC factors favor granting relief.\nTime is \u201c[t]he first and most important factor.\u201d In re Core\nCommunications, Inc., 531 F.3d 849, 855 (D.C.

The\n\f                               11\n\nAct directs the agencies to \u201cmake every effort\u201d to rule on\napplications within two years, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(a)(2)(E), but\nafter nineteen, the agencies have little to show for their labors.\nAlthough \u201c[t]here is no per se rule as to how long is too long,\u201d\na \u201creasonable time for agency action is typically counted in\nweeks or months, not years.\u201d In re Am.

Indeed, we have\nfound far shorter delays than nineteen years to be \u201cnothing less\nthan egregious.\u201d In re Am.

Cir. 1975) (\u201c[N]ine\nyears should be enough time for any agency to decide almost\nany issue.\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\n     The agencies argue that the Act\u2019s timeline is aspirational.\nSee Gov\u2019t Br. 23-25. But even the lack of a hard deadline \u201cdoes\nnot give government officials carte blanche to ignore their legal\nobligations.\u201d Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1096 (D.C. Cir.\n2001). Although the Act does not impose a rigid schedule, it\nprovides a ruler against which the agencies\u2019 progress must be\nmeasured. And that progress simply doesn\u2019t measure up.\n\n     The agencies further insist that their task is complicated\nand time intensive. See Gov\u2019t Br. 28-29. Of course, a\nreasonable time for action depends on \u201cthe complexity of the\ntask at hand, the significance (and permanence) of the outcome,\nand the resources available to the agency.\u201d Mashpee\nWampanoag Tribal Council, Inc. v. Norton, 336 F.3d 1094,\n1102 (D.C. Cir. 2003). But the failure to meet the timeline in\nthis case is primarily attributable to interagency conflict, not\n\f                               12\n\nfinancial or personnel shortages. Mandamus relief can\u2019t make\nmoney grow on trees, but it can end an interagency turf war.\n\n     Most of the remaining TRAC factors either favor granting\nrelief or are neutral. \u201c[T]ak[ing] into account the nature and\nextent of the interests prejudiced by delay,\u201d 750 F.2d at 80, we\nnote that park visitors are among the Act\u2019s intended\nbeneficiaries and the ones most harmed by the agencies\u2019 listless\npace. Granting relief will aid these visitors by reducing the\ndisruptive impacts of air tours. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(b)(1)(B)\n(stating that an \u201cobjective of any air tour management plan\u201d\nshould be to mitigate \u201cadverse impacts\u201d on \u201cvisitor\nexperiences\u201d). Moreover, \u201cdelays that might be reasonable in\nthe sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when\nhuman health and welfare are at stake.\u201d TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80.\nThough this is not a case where inaction risks life and limb, see\nPub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. Auchter, 702 F.2d 1150,\n1157 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the agencies\u2019 failure to regulate air tours\nharms visitor welfare to some extent by exposing visitors to\nunmitigated noise pollution, see H.R. REP. NO. 106-167, at 95\n(1999) (noting that the FAA has \u201cresponsibility for . . .\nprotecting the public health and welfare from aircraft noise.\u201d).\nThus, these factors are at least neutral toward Petitioners.\n\n                                2\n\n     Only one TRAC factor\u2014competing agency priorities\u2014\nseems to favor the agencies. Precedent directs us to \u201cconsider\nthe effect of expediting delayed action on agency activities of\na higher or competing priority.\u201d TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80. The\nagencies argue that (1) regulating commercial air tours is only\none \u201csmall component\u201d of their missions, which must compete\nfor resources with other projects; and (2) we should not upset\nthe agencies\u2019 newly proposed schedule, which prioritizes some\nparks over others. Gov\u2019t Br. 29-31.\n\f                                13\n\n\n     But the agencies\u2019 competing obligations cannot justify\ntheir nineteen-year holdup. See Cobell, 240 F.3d at 1097\n(\u201c[N]either a lack of sufficient funds nor administrative\ncomplexity, in and of themselves, justify extensive delay.\u201d).\nAlthough we appreciate that it may be difficult for the agencies\nto complete management plans or voluntary agreements at all\nof the outstanding parks in the two years that Petitioners\nrequest, that doesn\u2019t make mandamus relief inappropriate.\nRecognizing that the agencies have legitimate resource-based\nconcerns, we order the agencies to propose a schedule for\nbringing all parks into compliance. In crafting this schedule,\nthe agencies should bear in mind that Congress expected them\nto complete the task in two years.\n\n     Moreover, while we will not grant mandamus relief that\nserves only to put the petitioner \u201cat the head of the queue\u201d\nwhile \u201cmov[ing] all others back one space,\u201d In re Barr\nLaboratories, Inc., 930 F.2d 72, 75 (D.C. Cir. 1991), we need\nnot reorder the agencies\u2019 priorities to grant relief here.\nPetitioners \u201care not asking to jump the line.\u201d Oral Arg. Tr.\n13:6-7. By ordering the agencies to produce a schedule, we do\nnot require them to address any particular park first. The\nagencies remain free to choose the order, provided they bring\nall parks into compliance within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n     Finally, the agencies implore us to allow them to try out\ntheir new plan before granting mandamus relief. Had the\nagencies submitted a plan imposing reasonable deadlines for\nall parks, we might agree. But they did not. The agencies\u2019 plan\ncovers only seven of the twenty-three outstanding parks. And\nwhile many of these parks have partial voluntary agreements\nor low levels of air tours, the agencies still anticipate that their\nplan will take up to four years to complete. That is too long.\n\f                               14\n\n     In any event, the agencies have already missed some of the\ntarget dates they\u2019ve set for themselves. For example, the\nagencies promised to publish final voluntary agreements with\nfixed-wing operators at Badlands National Park and Mount\nRushmore National Memorial by January 31, 2020. Sauvajot\nSupp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17. It\u2019s now May, and the agencies still have\nnot published either agreement. See National Park Units\nRequiring      Air    Tour     Management      Plans,      FAA,\nhttps://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ar\nc/programs/air_tour_management_plan/park_specific_plans;\nsee also Gov\u2019t 28(j) Letter (Dec. 6, 2019) (explaining that the\nagencies were also \u201cunable to meet [their] target\u201d for\npublishing \u201cnotices of draft voluntary agreements\u201d at these\nparks). If the agencies can\u2019t stick to their own plan with the\nthreat of judicial supervision hanging over them, how can we\nexpect them to do so when the threat is gone?\n\n                               IV\n\n     Left to their own devices, the agencies have failed to\ncomply with their statutory mandate for the past nineteen years.\nAccordingly, we grant the petition for a writ of mandamus and\norder the agencies to produce a schedule within 120 days of the\nissuance of this opinion for bringing all twenty-three parks into\ncompliance. See In re United Mine Workers of Am. Int\u2019l Union,\n190 F.3d 545, 554-56 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (ordering an agency to\nproduce a schedule in response to a mandamus petition and\nretaining jurisdiction); MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. FCC, 627\nF.2d 322, 343-46 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (same); Nader, 520 F.2d at\n207 (same).\n\n    We fully expect that the agencies will make every effort to\nproduce a plan that will enable them to complete the task within\ntwo years, as Congress directed. If the agencies anticipate that\n\f                              15\n\nit will take them more than two years, they must offer specific,\nconcrete reasons for why that is so in their proposal.\n\n    The court will retain jurisdiction to approve the plan and\nmonitor the agencies\u2019 progress.

The Air Tour Management Act of 2000 directs the FAA\n\f                                2\n\nand NPS to \u201cmake every effort\u201d to establish rules governing\nsuch flights within two years of the first application. Although\napplications have been pending at twenty-five parks for nearly\ntwo decades, the agencies have fulfilled their statutory mandate\nat only two. Petitioners seek a writ of mandamus to compel the\nagencies to regulate air tours at seven parks where they have\ninjured members. Because the agencies have failed to timely\ndo so, we grant the petition.\n\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n     The Air Tour Management Act of 2000 requires vendors\nwho wish to conduct commercial air tours over certain national\nparks and tribal lands to first obtain a permit from the FAA. See\nPub. L. No. 106-181, \u00a7\u00a7 801-809, 114 Stat. 61, 185-94\n(codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128 and note). The Act\nprovides that the FAA, \u201cin cooperation with\u201d the NPS, \u201cshall\nestablish an air tour management plan . . . whenever a person\napplies for authority to conduct a commercial air tour\noperation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(b)(1)(A).

Reg. 6,802, 6,803 (Feb. 13, 2007).\n\n     The agencies\u2019 efforts to comply with the Act got off to a\npromising start. In 2000, they established the National Park\nOverflights Advisory Group, and by 2002, they had published\na rule defining \u201ccommercial air tour operations\u201d and launching\na permit application system. See National Parks Air Tour\nManagement, 67 Fed. Reg. 65,662 (Oct. 25, 2002). But trouble\nbegan to brew when the agencies started to respond to the\noperators\u2019 applications. Each agency prioritized different goals\nand sought to retain as much control over the process as\npossible. See Lusk Decl. \u00b6 45; Trevino Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-24. The\nFAA emphasized air traffic safety; the NPS, protecting park\nresources and visitor experience. As a result, the agencies\nbickered over everything from responsibility for making\ncertain NEPA determinations to the proper metric for\nmeasuring baseline noise levels. For example, the NPS \u201csought\nsole jurisdiction\u201d over environmental \u201cimpact determinations\non park resources,\u201d but the FAA refused to \u201cabdicat[e]\u201d its role\nin that process or defer to the \u201cpark superintendent\u2019s\nprofessional judgment.\u201d Lusk Decl. \u00b6 45. \u201cThe inability to\nresolve these issues\u201d often brought \u201cwork to a standstill.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\n     To be </span><pre class=\"inline\">sure, the agencies kept busy. Despite their\ninfighting, they took steps to establish management plans at\nsixteen parks, holding stakeholder meetings, drafting\ndocuments, and conducting noise studies. But because the\nagencies \u201cwere never able to resolve a number\u201d of their\nsquabbles,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> they never </span><pre class=\"inline\">got \u201cbeyond [the] initial stages of\nenvironmental review\u201d at any park, Gov\u2019t Br. 11, and \u201cnever\n\f                                4\n\nissued a draft [management plan or] NEPA document . . . for\npublic review and comment,\u201d Lusk Decl. \u00b6 45.\n\n      Twelve years passed, and the agencies still hadn\u2019t come up\nwith a single management plan. In an effort to speed things up,\nCongress amended the Act to exempt parks with fifty or fewer\nair tours per year and permit the agencies to enter into voluntary\nagreements in lieu of management plans. See FAA\nModernization and Reform Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-95,\n\u00a7 501, 126 Stat. 11, 100-03 (codified at 49 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 40128(b)(7)). Voluntary agreements are more flexible and\neasier to implement. The agencies need not jump through as\nmany procedural hoops to create them, as they aren\u2019t subject to\nNEPA and don\u2019t require full-dress notice and comment. 49\nU.S.C. \u00a7 40128(b)(7)(C). But there\u2019s a catch\u2014voluntary\nagreements must be, well, voluntary. Unlike management\nplans, voluntary agreements can\u2019t be imposed without operator\napproval. What\u2019s more, to substitute for a management plan,\nthe voluntary agreement must be unanimous; all operators\npossessing interim operating authority must sign on.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\u00a7 40128(b)(7)(A). </span><pre class=\"inline\">A single holdout can force the agencies back\nto the drawing board.\n\n     After Congress amended the Act, the agencies agreed to\nput management plans on the back burner and focus their\nefforts on voluntary agreements. They anticipated that these\nagreements would be easier to complete, and they were right\u2014\nto some extent.\n\n     In 2015 and 2016, the agencies finalized voluntary\nagreements with the air tour operators at Big Cypress National\nPreserve and Biscayne National Park, bringing these parks into\ncompliance with the Act. But the statutory fix was no magic\nbullet. Getting air tour operators to sign on to voluntary\nagreements without the credible threat of a management plan\n\f                                 5\n\nproved difficult. Each operator gains a competitive advantage\nby hanging on to their (largely unregulated) interim authority\nwhile their rivals voluntarily accept restrictions. See Sauvajot\nDecl. \u00b6 7; Trevino Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. Unable to credibly threaten\nholdouts with the prospect of a stricter management plan, the\nagencies lack the necessary leverage to bring everyone to the\ntable. For example, although the agencies drafted partial\nagreements for Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and\nRainbow Bridge National Monument, those agreements don\u2019t\nyet pass muster under the Act because two of the nine operators\nhave refused to join. Still, the agencies have pressed on. They\nare currently working on voluntary agreements for Badlands\nNational Park and Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n\n                                 B\n\n     In 2018, Public Employees for Environmental\nResponsibility and the Hawaii Island Malama Pono\nCoalition\u2014organizations      representing   national    park\nemployees, visitors, and hiking guides\u2014filed a petition for a\nwrit of mandamus that would compel the agencies to establish\nmanagement plans or voluntary agreements within two years at\nseven parks: Bryce Canyon National Park, Glacier National\nPark, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Haleakala\nNational Park, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Lake Mead\nNational Recreation Area, and Muir Woods National\nMonument.* We dismissed that petition for lack of Article III\nstanding because it listed only the FAA as respondent and\n\n*\n  The agencies inform us that Muir Woods National Monument is\nnow exempt from the Act\u2019s requirements because it has fewer than\nfifty overflights per year and the NPS hasn\u2019t exercised its statutory\nauthority to withdraw that exemption. See Gov\u2019t 28(j) Letter (Dec.\n4, 2019); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40128(a)(5)(A)-(B). Thus, we do not include\nit in the relief afforded here.\n\f                               6\n\nPetitioners\u2019 injuries weren\u2019t redressable by the FAA alone. See\nIn re Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility, No. 18-1044 (D.C.\nCir. Nov. 13, 2018) (per curiam). Petitioners\u2019 new filing, which\nnames both the FAA and NPS as respondents, does not suffer\nfrom this jurisdictional defect.\n\n     In response to this litigation, the agencies produced a\nschedule for bringing into compliance one park named in the\npetition and six other parks. This plan sets target dates for\nestablishing voluntary agreements at Badlands National Park,\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park, Mount Rainier\nNational Park, and Mount Rushmore National Memorial,\nranging from January 31, 2020 to March 31, 2022. If the\nagencies can\u2019t produce unanimous voluntary agreements at\nthose parks within eighteen months, the plan calls for the\nagencies to develop management plans. The plan also calls for\nthe agencies to establish management plans at Death Valley\nNational Park, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and\nRainbow Bridge National Monument by May 31, 2022 at the\nlatest.

Here, petitioner\nPharmaceutical Manufacturing Research Services (\u201cPMRS\u201d)\nsought approval to market a prescription opioid drug that\nPMRS claims will be less prone to abuse by patients. The\nFDA denied the application, finding that PMRS\u2019s draft label\nwas false and misleading because there was no evidence that\nthe drug in fact possessed abuse deterrent properties. The\nagency also denied PMRS\u2019s request for a hearing regarding\napproval of its application. PMRS challenges both\ndeterminations under the Administrative Procedure Act. We\nconclude that the FDA\u2019s decision to deny the application was\nreasonable and consistent with law and that its decision to\ndeny PMRS\u2019s request for a hearing was not an abuse of\ndiscretion. We therefore deny the petition for review.\n\n                               I.\n\n     In recent years, as the prescription opioid crisis gripping\nthe United States has worsened, the pharmaceutical industry\nhas placed increasing emphasis on developing new\nformulations of opioid medications designed to deter abuse.\nSuch \u201cabuse-deterrent formulations\u201d possess physical or\nchemical properties that are intended to make it more difficult\nfor patients to take advantage of \u201cthe known or expected\nroutes of [opioid] abuse, such as crushing in order to snort or\ndissolving in order to inject.\u201d FDA, Abuse-Deterrent Opioid\nAnalgesics      (last     updated       June     11,      2019),\nhttps://go.usa.gov/xyKd7.\n\n    As for any new drug, a manufacturer seeking FDA\napproval to market a prescription opioid with a label\ndescribing the drug as \u201cabuse deterrent\u201d must establish,\n\f                               3\namong other things, \u201csubstantial evidence that the drug will\nhave the effect it purports \u2026 to have under the conditions of\nuse prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed\nlabeling thereof,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(5), and that the\nproposed label is not \u201cfalse or misleading in any particular,\u201d\nid. \u00a7 355(d)(7). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is defined in the Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d) as \u201cadequate and well-\ncontrolled investigations, including clinical investigations, by\nexperts \u2026, on the basis of which it could fairly and\nresponsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will\nhave the effect it purports or is represented to have \u2026 in the\n\u2026 proposed labeling thereof.\u201d Id. \u00a7 355(d).\n\n     With respect to abuse deterrent opioids, the FDA has\nelaborated on the FDCA\u2019s general evidentiary standards for\nnew drugs. In 2015, the agency published a guidance\ndocument that purports to \u201cexplain[] FDA\u2019s current thinking\u201d\nabout the types of clinical studies \u201cthat should be conducted\nto demonstrate that a given formulation [of an opioid] has\nabuse-deterrent properties,\u201d \u201chow those studies should be\nperformed and evaluated[,] \u2026 and their implications in\nproduct labeling.\u201d FDA, Abuse-Deterrent Opioids\u2014\nEvaluation and Labeling: Guidance for Industry 1 (Apr.\n2015) (\u201c2015 Guidance\u201d), https://www.fda.gov/media/84819/\ndownload. The 2015 Guidance sets out three categories of\n\u201cpremarket studies\u201d that the FDA states will be \u201cappropriate\u201d\n\u201c[i]n most cases \u2026 to obtain a full and scientifically rigorous\nunderstanding of the impact of a technology or technologies\non a product\u2019s abuse potential.\u201d Id. at 5.\n\n    Petitioner PMRS is a privately owned pharmaceutical\ncompany that produces a range of oral solid and liquid drugs.\nIn January 2017, PMRS submitted a new drug application\n(\u201cNDA\u201d) seeking FDA approval for an immediate-release\nformulation of oxycodone that PMRS claimed to have abuse\n\f                              4\ndeterrent properties. In its application, PMRS proposed to\ninclude \u201cADF,\u201d short for \u201cAbuse Deterrent Formulation,\u201d in\nthe product name and to include various statements in the\nlabel describing the drug\u2019s abuse deterrent chemical and\nphysical properties. The proposed label read in relevant part:\n\n        TRADENAME is formulated with inactive\n        ingredients that make the capsule more\n        difficult to manipulate for misuse and\n        abuse. \u2026\n        In vitro physical and chemical manipulation\n        studies       \u2026        demonstrated       that\n        TRADENAME capsules \u2026 have increased\n        resistance to physical and chemical\n        extraction [relative to a previously approved\n        opioid, Roxicodone].\n        There is no clinical evidence that\n        TRADENAME has a reduced abuse\n        liability compared to immediate-release\n        oxycodone.\n        Abuse of TRADENAME by injection, as\n        well as by the oral and nasal routes, is still\n        possible.\n\nJ.A. 66\u201367. The label\u2019s claim regarding \u201cinactive ingredients\u201d\nreferred in part to the inclusion of a dye blend that was\nintended to give a solution prepared from the drug a \u201cdark,\nopaque,\u201d \u201ccontaminated\u201d appearance. J.A. 412. PMRS\nclaimed this would \u201ccreate a visual deterrent to abuse\u201d by\nintravenous injection. J.A. 412.\n\n     In November 2017, the FDA sent PMRS a complete\nresponse letter explaining that its NDA could not be approved\nin its current form. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110(a) (describing\n\f                                  5\nFDA process for complete response letters). The letter\nidentified numerous deficiencies in the NDA that would bar\napproval under governing law. Most relevant to this appeal,\nthe FDA stated it could not conclude based on the evidence\nthat PMRS\u2019s drug possessed the abuse deterrent properties\ndescribed in the proposed label. Among other things, the\nagency found that PMRS had failed to submit evidence\nsupporting its hypothesis that the inclusion of dye in the\nformulation would deter intravenous abuse. Moreover, studies\nshowed that PMRS\u2019s drug was \u201ceasily manipulated to create a\nsolution suitable for abuse by the [intravenous] route.\u201d J.A.\n54. The FDA recommended that PMRS address these\ndeficiencies by reformulating its product with properties\nexpected to deter intravenous and nasal1 abuse and by\nconducting Category 1, 2, and 3 studies (as defined in the\n2015 Guidance) to support the abuse deterrent labeling\nclaims.2\n\n    Rather than attempt to remedy these deficiencies and\nresubmit its NDA, PMRS requested a hearing regarding\napproval of its application. In a series of submissions to the\nFDA over the ensuing months, PMRS asserted that its\n\n1\n  PMRS initially claimed that its product possessed properties\nexpected to deter nasal abuse, but later abandoned that claim,\nconceding that there was insufficient evidence to support it.\n2\n  The complete response letter also identified several other statutory\ngrounds on which to deny the application, including that PMRS had\nnot provided sufficient data to show that the drug\u2019s formulation was\nsafe, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(1), or that \u201cthe methods used in, and\nthe facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and\npacking of such drug are [adequate] to preserve its identity,\nstrength, quality, and purity,\u201d id. \u00a7 355(d)(3). The FDA\nrecommended steps PMRS could take to address those deficiencies.\n\f                               6\nproposed label reflected a \u201cnovel approach to reducing\n[opioid] abuse potential\u201d by focusing on product \u201cindication\nand recommended dosing [more] than the hypothetical abuse-\ndeterrent properties of [the drug\u2019s] formulation.\u201d J.A. 890. In\nother words, PMRS did not submit additional evidence to\nsupport the label\u2019s statements concerning the drug\u2019s physical\nand chemical properties. Instead, the company insisted that its\nproduct carried less potential for abuse because it would be\nindicated only for acute, rather than long-term, pain\nmanagement, and because the label would recommend a\nmaximum daily dosage that was lower than similar opioids\nalready on the market. According to PMRS, the acute pain\nindication coupled with lower dosing recommendations would\nmake its drug \u201cthe safest labeled opioid\u201d on the market. J.A.\n575. PMRS also argued that the FDA\u2019s approach to abuse\ndeterrence, as laid out in the 2015 Guidance, was \u201cmisleading,\nunscientific, and dangerous,\u201d J.A. 575, and that a hearing was\nneeded to address the flaws in the agency\u2019s approach.\n\n     In June 2018, the FDA sent PMRS a draft order\nproposing denial of PMRS\u2019s application and hearing request.\nThe draft order reiterated the deficiencies identified in the\ncomplete response letter and explained that PMRS had failed\nto identify a genuine factual issue that would justify a hearing.\nThe agency described numerous statutory grounds on which\nto deny the NDA, including that PMRS\u2019s proposed label was\nfalse and misleading given the lack of scientific support for\nthe label\u2019s statements about abuse deterrence.\n\n     Two months after receiving the proposed order, PMRS\nfiled a response in which it suggested modifying the draft\nlabel to read, as relevant here:\n\n         Oxycodone HC1 IR ADF capsule is\n         formulated with inactive ingredients\n\f                               7\n         intended to make the capsule more difficult\n         to manipulate for misuse and/or abuse.\n         Postmarketing epidemiology evidence is\n         required to demonstrate meaningful abuse-\n         deterrent properties. Oxycodone HC1 IR\n         ADF capsules should be prescribed\n         knowing meaningful abuse-deterrent\n         properties have not been proven.\n\nJ.A. 893 (emphasis in original).\n\n     The FDA issued a final order denying PMRS\u2019s request\nfor a hearing and refusing to approve its NDA in October\n2018. See 83 Fed. Reg. 54,598 (Oct. 30, 2018) (\u201cDenial\nOrder\u201d). The agency\u2019s decision rested exclusively on its\nfinding that PMRS\u2019s proposed label was false or misleading\nunder the FDCA. Id. at 54,601\u201302 (citing 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(d)(7)). As the FDA explained, PMRS failed to provide\nevidence supporting its claim that the drug \u201chas properties\nthat make it more difficult to manipulate for purposes of\nabuse and misuse than a conventional formulation.\u201d Id. at\n54,600. Given the complete \u201clack of sufficient, reliable\nevidence supporting PMRS\u2019s proposed labeling for abuse-\ndeterrent properties,\u201d the FDA found that a hearing was not\nrequired because there was no \u201cgenuine and substantial issue\nof fact\u201d as to whether the NDA was approvable in its present\nform. Id. (capitalization altered). The FDA declined to\naddress additional statutory deficiencies in the NDA because\n\u201ceven if resolved in PMRS\u2019s favor, PMRS\u2019s NDA would still\nbe refused approval in its present form\u201d due to the false and\nmisleading label. Id. at 54,603.\n\n    The FDA acknowledged that PMRS had recently\nproposed modifying the label to state that \u201cmeaningful abuse-\ndeterrent properties have not been proven,\u201d but refused to\n\f                              8\nconsider revisions to the NDA made months after PMRS\nrequested a hearing. Id. at 54,600 n.9. The agency also noted\nthat in any event the proposed revisions did not appear to\naddress its concerns about the false or misleading label, as\nPMRS still sought to include \u201cADF\u201d in the product name,\nconveying that the product had an \u201cabuse deterrent\nformulation.\u201d Id. Similarly, the FDA declined to address other\narguments raised by PMRS that did not relate to the specific\nconcerns about the label cited in the complete response\nletter\u2014including PMRS\u2019s claim that its product would deter\nabuse because it would \u201conly be labeled for management of\nacute [rather than chronic] pain.\u201d Id. at 54,602 n.20.\n\n     Finally, the FDA concluded a hearing was not needed to\naddress PMRS\u2019s \u201clegal and policy objections to FDA\u2019s\napproach to evaluating, labeling, and approving opioids.\u201d Id.\nat 54,602. The FDA explained that these issues had no\nbearing on the approvability of PMRS\u2019s application, and that\nthe agency had determined a hearing was not otherwise in the\npublic interest, see 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.200(g)(6), because a\nhearing on a specific new drug application was not the\nappropriate forum to address broader concerns about the\nagency\u2019s approach to the opioid epidemic. 83 Fed. Reg. at\n54,602\u201303.\n\n    PMRS timely filed a petition for review pursuant to 21\nU.S.C. \u00a7 355(h), which permits applicants to appeal an FDA\norder denying approval of a new drug application to this\ncourt.\n\n                             II.\n\n      PMRS challenges the denial of the NDA on two grounds:\nfirst, that a false or misleading label is not a sufficient\nstatutory ground on which to deny a new drug application;\nand second, that denying the application based on the draft\n\f                               9\nlabel was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. We\nexplain in turn why each APA challenge fails.\n\n                              A.\n\n     As a preliminary matter, PMRS asserts that the FDA\u2019s\nrefusal to approve its application was contrary to law because\nthe FDCA does not permit the agency to deny an NDA solely\non the basis of a false or misleading label.\n\n     As with all questions of statutory interpretation, we start\nwith the text. See, e.g., Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1856\n(2016). The FDCA provides first that the FDA \u201cshall \u2026\napprove [a new drug] application if [the agency] finds that\nnone of the grounds for denying approval specified in\nsubsection (d) applies.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(c)(1)(A) (emphasis\nadded). Subsection (d), in turn, provides that the FDA \u201cshall\nissue an order refusing to approve [an] application\u201d if it finds\nthat one of seven grounds\u2014enumerated in subsections (d)(1)\nthrough (d)(7)\u2014exists. Id. \u00a7 355(d) (emphasis added).\nSubsection (d)(7) covers situations in which the FDA\nconcludes, \u201cbased on a fair evaluation of all material facts,\u201d\nthat the applicant\u2019s proposed labeling \u201cis false or misleading\nin any particular.\u201d Id. \u00a7 355(d)(7). Together, these provisions\nindicate that any of the seven grounds for denial specified in\nsubsection (d) is a basis on which the agency must deny an\napplication; if none of these grounds applies, the application\nmust be approved.\n\n     The sentence following the seven grounds for denial,\nhowever, complicates matters. It states that if the FDA \u201cfinds\nthat clauses (1) through (6) do not apply, [the agency] shall\nissue an order approving the application.\u201d Id. \u00a7 355(d)\n(emphasis added). Read in isolation, this sentence would\nsuggest that subsection (d)(7)\u2014the false or misleading\nlabeling provision\u2014does not furnish a sufficient basis,\n\f                              10\nstanding alone, to deny an application. Yet this clause is in\ndirect conflict with the language in Section 355(c) and (d)\ndiscussed above, which requires the agency to deny an\napplication on any of the seven grounds, including false or\nmisleading labeling. The statute does not explain this internal\ninconsistency, and there is no other language in Section 355\nsuggesting that subsection (d)(7) should be treated differently\nfrom the other six grounds for denial.\n\n    PMRS contends that the reference to \u201cclauses (1) through\n(6)\u201d in Section 355(d) means the FDA cannot refuse to\napprove an NDA based solely on a false or misleading label.\nHere, the agency relied exclusively on subsection (d)(7) in\ndenying PMRS\u2019s application. PMRS argues that the Denial\nOrder therefore contravened the plain text of the FDCA and\nwas contrary to law within the meaning of the APA. See 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n     The FDA responds that this inconsistency in the text\nreflects a scrivener\u2019s error resulting from a 1984 amendment\nto the FDCA that added a seventh ground for denying a new\ndrug application. In the pre-1984 version of the statute, the\nfalse or misleading label provision appeared at subsection\n(d)(6) and was followed by the same reference to \u201cclauses (1)\nthrough (6)\u201d that appears in the current version. In other\nwords, under the prior iteration of Section 355(d), a false or\nmisleading label was a sufficient ground for denying an\napplication. Congress amended the statute by inserting a new\nground for denial at subsection (d)(6) and moving the false or\nmisleading labeling clause to (d)(7)\u2014but it left unchanged the\nreference to \u201cclauses (1) through (6)\u201d in the sentence that\nfollows. Compare 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (1982), with 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(d) (1988). The FDA maintains that nothing in the\ncurrent statute indicates that Congress intended this\nrenumbering to alter the longstanding statutory scheme by\n\f                              11\npermitting the FDA, for the first time, to approve an\napplication that proposes false or misleading labeling. Indeed,\nthe remainder of Section 355 directly contradicts that\ninterpretation. Thus, the FDA maintains the only plausible\nreading is that Congress simply neglected to update one\nclause of Section 355(d) to include the renumbered ground\n(7).\n\n     We agree with the FDA that a false or misleading label is\na sufficient ground for denial. As written, Section 355 states\nan irreconcilable contradiction\u2014two provisions indicate that\nthe agency can deny an application based only on false or\nmisleading labeling, but another suggests it cannot. While we\ncannot \u201cjudicially amend[] a statute \u2018to provide for what [we]\nmight think \u2026 is the preferred result,\u2019\u201d this case represents a\nrare situation where \u201cthere is no plausible reading of the plain\ntext absent recognizing and correcting for the error.\u201d United\nStates v. Palmer, 854 F.3d 39, 52\u201353 (D.C. Cir. 2017)\n(quoting Lamie v. U.S. Tr., 540 U.S. 526, 542 (2004)). Under\nsuch circumstances, \u201cit is not contrary to sound principles of\ninterpretation \u2026 to give the totality of context precedence\nover a single word\u201d\u2014or, in this instance, a single number.\nAntonin Scalia, Common-Law Courts in a Civil-Law System:\nThe Role of United States Federal Courts in Interpreting the\nConstitution and Laws, in A Matter of Interpretation: Federal\nCourts and the Law 3, 20\u201321 (Amy Gutmann ed., 1997).\n\n    Here, the totality of statutory context confirms that the\nFDA must deny an application if the label is false or\nmisleading, consistent with the text in Section 355(c)(1)(A)\nand the beginning of Section 355(d). Section 355(e), for\nexample, provides that the FDA may withdraw its prior\napproval of a new drug if \u201cnew information\u201d reveals that the\ndrug\u2019s label is \u201cfalse or misleading in any particular.\u201d 21\nU.S.C. \u00a7 355(e). It would be incoherent to allow the FDA to\n\f                                  12\nwithdraw approval of a drug for false or misleading labeling,\nbut not to allow the FDA to deny approval on the same\ngrounds. Similarly, neighboring sections of the FDCA that\ngovern approvals of medical devices and animal drugs\nunambiguously direct the FDA to deny any application that\nproposes false or misleading labeling. See id. \u00a7 360e(d)(2)(D);\nid. \u00a7 360b(d)(1)(H). The language and structure of these\nprovisions is substantially identical to Section 355(d), aside\nfrom Section 355(d)\u2019s contradictory reference to \u201cclauses (1)\nthrough (6).\u201d3 Thus, throughout the statute, Congress\nconsistently prohibited the FDA from allowing drugs, medical\ndevices, and other regulated products to reach the market with\nfalse or misleading labels. This context bolsters our\nconclusion that the 1984 amendments did not establish a\nnovel standard for new drug applications that disrupts the\nbroader statutory scheme. Cf. Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697\nF.3d 257, 263 (5th Cir. 2012) (\u201c[A] statutory provision cannot\nbe read in isolation, but necessarily derives meaning from the\ncontext provided by the surrounding provisions, as well as the\nbroader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d (citation and\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n    For similar reasons, the statutory history of Section\n355(d) reinforces our interpretation. Before 1984, Section 355\nunequivocally required the FDA to deny a new drug\napplication based on false or misleading labeling. See 21\nU.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (1982). The 1984 amendments inserted a new\nsubsection (d)(6), addressing patent information, but did not\n\n3\n  A separate chapter of the FDCA, addressing regulation of tobacco\nproducts, also directs the FDA to deny an application to market a\ntobacco product if the agency finds, \u201cbased on a fair evaluation of\nall material facts, the proposed labeling is false or misleading in any\nparticular.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(c)(2)(C).\n\f                              13\nchange the false or misleading labeling provision aside from\nmoving it to subsection (d)(7). See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (1988).\nConstruing the reference to \u201cclauses (1) through (6)\u201d to\neffectively read \u201cclauses (1) through (7)\u201d does the \u201cleast\nviolence to the text.\u201d Green v. Bock Laundry Mach. Co., 490\nU.S. 504, 529 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment);\nsee also Lacson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 726 F.3d\n170, 173 n.2 (D.C.

This interpretation, however, has absolutely no basis in\nthe text and would require us to \u201crewrit[e] the statute rather\nthan correct[] a technical mistake.\u201d United States v. X-\nCitement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 82 (1994) (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n     True scrivener\u2019s errors are unusual and we should not\nlightly assume that Congress has made one. Here, however,\nreading the text of Section 355 in light of the broader context\nand structure of the statute demonstrates that the lingering\nreference to \u201cclauses (1) through (6)\u201d is best understood as an\nerror. We will not privilege one contradictory numbered\nreference over the rest of the statutory text, context, and\nstructure. Accordingly, we conclude the FDA did not act\ncontrary to law in denying PMRS\u2019s NDA based solely on its\nfinding that the proposed labeling was false or misleading.\n\f                              14\n                              B.\n\n     We next consider PMRS\u2019s claim that the FDA\u2019s decision\nto deny approval of PMRS\u2019s NDA was \u201carbitrary, capricious,\n\u2026 or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 706(2)(A). As with all such claims, our review focuses on\nwhether the agency\u2019s decision was \u201creasonable and\nreasonably explained,\u201d and \u201cbased on \u2018consideration of the\nrelevant factors.\u2019\u201d Nat\u2019l Tel.

In the context of a challenge to the FDA\u2019s\ndecisionmaking, we \u201cgive[] a high level of deference\u201d to the\nagency\u2019s scientific analysis of the evidence before it, Rempfer\nv. Sharfstein, 583 F.3d 860, 867 (D.C.

Applying these\nstandards to the present case, we conclude the FDA acted\nreasonably and in accordance with applicable law in finding\nthat PMRS\u2019s proposed label was false and misleading and in\ndenying the NDA on that basis.\n\n     The FDA examined the evidence presented by PMRS and\nreasonably concluded that it did not support the specific\nstatements included in PMRS\u2019s proposed labeling. PMRS\u2019s\ndraft label and proposed product name represented that its\ndrug possessed physical and chemical abuse deterrent\nproperties. Yet the FDA found that PMRS failed to present\nsubstantial and reliable evidence showing that its\n\u201cformulation \u2026 actually possess[es] those properties.\u201d 83\nFed. Reg. at 54,603. The reasons for this finding were\nexplained in detail in the Denial Order, as well as in the\nFDA\u2019s earlier responses to PMRS. As an initial matter, the\nFDA emphasized that PMRS provided no evidence indicating\n\f                              15\nthat the inclusion of a dye that would make an injectable\nsolution derived from the drug \u201cdark, opaque, [and]\n\u2018contaminated-looking\u2019\u201d would actually deter abuse. Id. at\n54,598. The agency found this hypothesis particularly\nproblematic given that people who abuse opioids \u201croutinely\ntake extraordinary risks in connection with their opioid\nabuse.\u201d Id. at 54,601. While PMRS criticizes the FDA for\n\u201cfocus[ing] myopically on the dye in denying the\napplication,\u201d Reply Br. 4, PMRS does not point to any other\nscientific support for the label\u2019s statements about the drug\u2019s\n\u201cinactive ingredients\u201d that the FDA overlooked.\n\n     Similarly, the FDA found no support for the draft label\u2019s\nstatement that the drug had \u201cincreased resistance to physical\nand chemical extraction\u201d as compared to a previously\napproved opioid, Roxicodone. In the Denial Order, the FDA\nnoted that this labeling claim \u201cappear[ed] to rest on a\nmisunderstanding of how th[e] term [\u2018extraction\u2019] is used in\nthe context of abuse-deterrent opioids,\u201d because PMRS\u2019s data\nin fact showed that oxycodone could be easily extracted from\nits product to create a solution suitable for injection. 83 Fed.\nReg. at 54,598 n.1. On appeal, PMRS argues that the FDA\nerred in its \u201ccursory dismissal of PMRS\u2019s evidence on\n\u2018solubility\u2019 and \u2018extraction,\u2019\u201d but never explains precisely\nwhat the FDA is supposed to have gotten wrong. PMRS Br.\n31.\n\n     The FDA also noted that PMRS had failed to submit any\nevidence indicating that its drug would \u201cdeter abuse by\nsnorting,\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. at 54,601, but acknowledged that\nPMRS had \u201cconceded \u2026 that the formulation should not be\nconsidered to have this property,\u201d id. at 54,598 n.2. PMRS\nargues that the agency should not have \u201crelie[d] heavily\u201d on\nthe absence of such evidence since PMRS had abandoned its\noriginal claim that the drug would deter nasal abuse. PMRS\n\f                                16\nBr. 30. While the FDA\u2019s discussion on this point admittedly is\nnot a model of clarity, it does not undermine the validity of\nthe agency\u2019s overall decisionmaking or its conclusion that\nPMRS provided no evidence that its formulation had abuse\ndeterrent properties of any kind.\n\n     The FDA next considered the disclaimers PMRS\nincluded in its draft label\u2014stating there was \u201cno clinical\nevidence\u201d that its product \u201chas a reduced abuse liability\ncompared to immediate-release oxycodone,\u201d and that abuse of\nits product is \u201cstill possible\u201d\u2014and concluded that they did not\nmake the label accurate. 83 Fed. Reg. at 54,602 n.17.\nJuxtaposed with the label\u2019s other statements about abuse\ndeterrence, the FDA found the disclaimers conveyed that\nPMRS\u2019s drug had abuse deterrent properties, even if it was\nnot \u201cabuse-proof.\u201d Id.4\n\n     Finally, the FDA articulated a rational explanation for its\nrefusal to consider the revisions to the draft label that PMRS\nsubmitted after its hearing request. According to the Denial\nOrder, by requesting a hearing, PMRS asked the FDA to\ndetermine whether its existing application could be approved,\nnot to opine on whether PMRS could at some point formulate\na different NDA that \u201cmight address some of the deficiencies\u201d\nidentified by the FDA. Id. at 54,600 n.9. We find this position\nto be consistent with the FDA\u2019s regulations, which require\napplicants to choose between resubmitting an application and\n\n4\n In its reply brief, PMRS claims that the FDA \u201c[did] not identify\nany of this text as affirmatively false or misleading,\u201d but does not\nengage with the FDA\u2019s actual analysis. Reply Br. 9. We will not\nconsider such a cursory argument raised for the first time on reply.\nDodge of Naperville, Inc. v. NLRB, 796 F.3d 31, 41 (D.C.

See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110(b).5 In any\nevent, the FDA explained that even the proposed revisions\nwould not address the FDA\u2019s central concern \u201cthat PMRS\u2019s\nlabeling represents that its product possesses abuse-deterrent\nproperties when the presence of such properties is not\nsupported by substantial and reliable evidence,\u201d because\nPMRS still proposed to include \u201cADF\u201d in the product name.\n83 Fed. Reg. at 54,600 n.9.\n\n     PMRS contends that the FDA departed from its precedent\nby refusing to consider these proposed revisions. But it fails\nto identify any examples of the FDA approving an NDA on\nthe basis of significant labeling revisions proposed after a\nhearing request, particularly where there was no evidence\nshowing the formulation had any abuse deterrent properties.\nIndeed, in the only arguably analogous example PMRS points\nto, the FDA approved an opioid formulation with an amended\nlabel describing the drug\u2019s abuse deterrent properties only\nafter finding that the applicant \u201cprovided sufficient data to\ndemonstrate that the \u2026 formulation appears to provide an\nincremental decrease in\u201d persistent nasal abuse. See FDA, Ctr.\nfor Drug Eval. & Research, App. No. 202080Orig1s000,\nSummary Review, at 18 (June 17, 2011). The FDA found no\ncomparable evidence here.\n\n    PMRS\u2019s remaining arguments all rest on the same\npremise: The FDA should have accepted PMRS\u2019s alternative,\n5\n  The regulation provides that after receiving a complete response\nletter, an applicant \u201cmust take one of\u201d three actions: (1) \u201cResubmit\nthe application \u2026, addressing all deficiencies identified in the\ncomplete response letter\u201d; (2) \u201c[w]ithdraw the application\u201d; or (3)\n\u201c[a]sk the agency to provide the applicant an opportunity for a\nhearing on the question of whether there are [statutory] grounds for\ndenying approval of the application.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110(b).\n\f                              18\nsuperior approach to opioid abuse deterrence and approved\nthe NDA notwithstanding the lack of evidence for the label\u2019s\nassertions about the drug\u2019s abuse deterrent formulation. Yet\nthe simple fact is that even if the FDA were willing to\nconsider PMRS\u2019s alternative evidence of abuse deterrence,\nsuch evidence would do nothing to fix the inaccuracies in the\nlabel PMRS proposed.\n\n     First, PMRS argues the FDA disregarded the statutory\nrequirement to consider the accuracy of a drug\u2019s labeling in\nlight of \u201call material facts,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(7), which,\naccording to PMRS, includes the \u201cconditions of use\nprescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed\nlabeling,\u201d id. \u00a7 355(d)(5). Here, PMRS proposed labeling its\ndrug with an indication for acute, rather than chronic, pain\nmanagement, and following the Center for Disease Control\u2019s\ndosing recommendations for immediate-release opioids.\nAccording to PMRS, the FDA\u2019s refusal to consider those\n\u201cconditions of use\u201d in assessing the accuracy of the draft label\nrendered the Denial Order contrary to law.\n\n    Next, PMRS argues that the agency failed to consider an\nimportant aspect of the problem when it arbitrarily refused to\n\u201c\u2018even consider the possibility\u2019 that PMRS\u2019s indications and\nstudies could support an abuse deterrent label.\u201d PMRS Br. 43\n(emphasis omitted) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 48).\nPMRS maintains that the FDA\u2019s approach to abuse\ndeterrence, as set out in the 2015 Guidance, is scientifically\nunsound, and that PMRS\u2019s purportedly novel focus on\nduration and dosing indications is more likely to deter abuse.\n\n    In effect, PMRS seeks to enlist the court in its preferred\napproach to abuse deterrence. Whatever the validity of its\nbroader claims, PMRS\u2019s proposal to label its product for acute\npain management and to recommend lower daily dosing\u2014\n\f                               19\nfeatures that have nothing do with a drug\u2019s physical or\nchemical properties\u2014has no bearing on the accuracy of its\nlabeling claims about the product\u2019s abuse deterrent\nformulation. While PMRS contends on appeal that its\nproposed label \u201cdescribed the product, not just its\n\u2018formulation,\u2019\u201d Reply Br. 4, the words of the proposed label\nbelie that contention. PMRS sought to designate its drug as an\n\u201cabuse deterrent formulation,\u201d not an abuse deterrent product.\n\n     The bottom line, as the FDA pointed out, is that PMRS\nprovided \u201cno evidence establish[ing] \u2026 that this formulation\nhas the abuse-deterrent properties PMRS propose[d] to\ninclude in its product labeling.\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. at 54,601.6\nBecause both the product name and the draft label focused on\n\n6\n  For this reason, PMRS\u2019s separate claim that the FDA improperly\ntreated the 2015 Guidance as binding law also fails. It is well\nestablished that \u201c[o]nly \u2018legislative rules\u2019\u201d promulgated through\npublic notice and comment \u201chave the force and effect of law.\u201d\nAppalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1020 (D.C. Cir.\n2000). PMRS contends that the FDA treats the 2015 Guidance as\nrequiring applicants seeking labeling for abuse deterrence to\npresent evidence from Category 1, 2, and 3 studies, without having\nput those evidentiary guidelines through notice and comment\nrulemaking. The problem for PMRS is that the FDA did not\npremise its denial solely on the absence of Category 1, 2, and 3\nstudies\u2014it denied the NDA due to the absence of any evidence\nsupporting PMRS\u2019s labeling claims. The FDCA requires applicants\nto support a proposed label with \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(d). Because PMRS failed to provide substantial evidence of\nany kind\u2014Guidance-compliant or otherwise\u2014it could not have\nmet the statutory standard. On these facts, we see no basis to\nconclude that the FDA applied the 2015 Guidance \u201cas if it were\nbinding.\u201d Nat\u2019l Mining Ass\u2019n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 253 (D.C.\nCir. 2014).\n\f                              20\nunproven abuse deterrent physical and chemical properties of\nPMRS\u2019s drug, they were false and misleading regardless of\nwhether PMRS is correct that there are other, more effective\nways of reducing opioid abuse. In other words, there was no\nreason for the FDA to separately consider the particular\n\u201cconditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in\n[PMRS\u2019s] proposed labeling\u201d once it had found that the label\nwould be false and misleading regardless of those conditions.\nSee 21 U.S.C. 355(d).\n\n     The FDCA requires the FDA to determine whether a\nproposed label is false or misleading \u201cbased on a fair\nevaluation of all material facts.\u201d Id. \u00a7 355(d)(7) (emphasis\nadded). For the reasons already stated, PMRS\u2019s evidence\nregarding alternative approaches to abuse deterrence was\nimmaterial to the agency\u2019s assessment of the specific claims\nin PMRS\u2019s proposed label. In the absence of countervailing\nevidence, we have no basis to question the agency\u2019s\nconclusion that the operative version of PMRS\u2019s proposed\nlabel created the false and misleading impression that the drug\npossessed abuse deterrent physical and chemical properties.\nSee Rempfer, 583 F.3d at 867 (according heightened\ndeference to FDA where \u201cthere [was] no scientific evidence\nin the administrative record to contradict [its] judgment\u201d).\nMeaningful review of the agency\u2019s actions does not require us\nto step into the FDA\u2019s shoes and reassess its scientific\njudgments\u2014a role that we are \u201cill-equipped\u201d to play \u201cunder\nthe guise of the APA\u2019s arbitrary and capricious standard.\u201d\nCytori Therapeutics, 715 F.3d at 927.

See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(c)(1) (after\nreviewing an NDA, the agency must either approve the\napplication or \u201cgive the applicant notice of an opportunity for\na hearing \u2026 on the question whether such application is\napprovable\u201d); accord 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.200. Our review of an\nagency\u2019s decision to grant or deny a hearing is \u201cnecessarily\ndeferential,\u201d and is \u201climited to an evaluation of whether [the\nagency] has given adequate consideration to all relevant\nevidence in the record.\u201d Nat\u2019l Corn Growers Ass\u2019n v. EPA,\n613 F.3d 266, 271\u201372 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citation and quotation\nmarks omitted). To warrant a hearing, a party\u2019s submission\nmust raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact \u201cthat might\naffect the outcome \u2026 under the governing law.\u201d John D.\nCopanos & Sons, Inc. v. FDA, 854 F.2d 510, 522\u201323 (D.C.\nCir. 1988) (citation omitted); see also 21 C.F.R. \u00a712.24(b)(4)\n(\u201cA hearing will not be granted on factual issues that are not\ndeterminative with respect to the action requested.\u201d). For\nmany of the reasons discussed in Part II.B, we find the FDA\nacted within its discretion in denying PMRS\u2019s hearing\nrequest.\n\n    As already explained, the FDA considered PMRS\u2019s\napplication and reasonably determined that there was no\nevidence to support PMRS\u2019s claim that its product had an\nabuse deterrent \u201cformulation.\u201d PMRS\u2019s evidence regarding\nduration and dosing therefore could not remedy the false and\nmisleading nature of its draft label, which focused on the\nproduct\u2019s chemical and physical properties. This meant that\nPMRS\u2019s alternative evidence, even if considered, necessarily\ncould not create a \u201cgenuine and substantial issue of fact\u201d that,\nif resolved in PMRS\u2019s favor, would justify approval of\n\f                              22\nPMRS\u2019s application. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.24(b). In other words,\nbecause PMRS\u2019s proffered evidence created no relevant\nfactual dispute, it did not provide a basis on which to grant a\nhearing. See Copanos, 854 F.3d at 523.\n\n     Nor can we conclude that PMRS\u2019s eleventh hour attempt\nto modify its proposed label created a genuine issue of fact\nrequiring a hearing. PMRS submitted a proposed revision to\nits draft label in August 2018\u2014many months after receiving\nthe complete response letter and electing to request a hearing\nrather than revise and resubmit its application. As already\nnoted, we find the FDA\u2019s explanation for its refusal to\nconsider revisions at this late stage to be reasonable. See\nsupra at 16\u201317.\n\n     Finally, we do not believe the FDA exceeded its\ndiscretion in refusing to grant PMRS\u2019s request for a hearing\non broader policy issues related to the problem of opioid\nabuse deterrence. PMRS might be dissatisfied with the\nagency\u2019s overall approach, but the FDA\u2019s regulations make\nclear that \u201ca hearing will not be granted on issues of policy\nand law.\u201d See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.24(b)(1).

In its application, PMRS proposed to\ninclude \u201cADF,\u201d short for \u201cAbuse Deterrent Formulation,\u201d in\nthe product name and to include various statements in the\nlabel describing the drug\u2019s abuse deterrent chemical and\nphysical properties. The proposed label read in relevant part:\n\n        TRADENAME is formulated with inactive\n        ingredients that make the capsule more\n        difficult to manipulate for misuse and\n        abuse. \u2026\n        In vitro physical and chemical manipulation\n        studies       \u2026        demonstrated       that\n        TRADENAME capsules \u2026 have increased\n        resistance to physical and chemical\n        extraction [relative to a previously approved\n        opioid, Roxicodone].\n        There is no clinical evidence that\n        TRADENAME has a reduced abuse\n        liability compared to immediate-release\n        oxycodone.\n        Abuse of TRADENAME by injection, as\n        well as by the oral and nasal routes, is still\n        possible.\n\nJ.A. 66\u201367. The label\u2019s claim regarding \u201cinactive ingredients\u201d\nreferred in part to the inclusion of a dye blend that was\nintended to give a solution prepared from the drug a \u201cdark,\nopaque,\u201d \u201ccontaminated\u201d appearance. J.A. 412. PMRS\nclaimed this would \u201ccreate a visual deterrent to abuse\u201d by\nintravenous injection. J.A. 412.\n\n     In November 2017, the FDA sent PMRS a complete\nresponse letter explaining that its NDA could not be approved\nin its current form. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.110(a) (describing\n\f                                  5\nFDA process for complete response letters). The letter\nidentified numerous deficiencies in the NDA that would bar\napproval under governing law. Most relevant to this appeal,\nthe FDA stated it could not conclude based on the evidence\nthat PMRS\u2019s drug possessed the abuse deterrent properties\ndescribed in the proposed label. Among other things, the\nagency found that PMRS had failed to submit evidence\nsupporting its hypothesis that the inclusion of dye in the\nformulation would deter intravenous abuse. Moreover, studies\nshowed that PMRS\u2019s drug was \u201ceasily manipulated to create a\nsolution suitable for abuse by the [intravenous] route.\u201d J.A.\n54. The FDA recommended that PMRS address these\ndeficiencies by reformulating its product with properties\nexpected to deter intravenous and nasal1 abuse and by\nconducting Category 1, 2, and 3 studies (as defined in the\n2015 Guidance) to support the abuse deterrent labeling\nclaims.2\n\n    Rather than attempt to remedy these deficiencies and\nresubmit its NDA, PMRS requested a hearing regarding\napproval of its application. In a series of submissions to the\nFDA over the ensuing months, PMRS asserted that its\n\n1\n  PMRS initially claimed that its product possessed properties\nexpected to deter nasal abuse, but later abandoned that claim,\nconceding that there was insufficient evidence to support it.\n2\n  The complete response letter also identified several other statutory\ngrounds on which to deny the application, including that PMRS had\nnot provided sufficient data to show that the drug\u2019s formulation was\nsafe, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d)(1), or that \u201cthe methods used in, and\nthe facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and\npacking of such drug are [adequate] to preserve its identity,\nstrength, quality, and purity,\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 355(d)(3). </span><pre class=\"inline\">The FDA\nrecommended steps PMRS could take to address those deficiencies.\n\f                               6\nproposed label reflected a \u201cnovel approach to reducing\n[opioid] abuse potential\u201d by focusing on product \u201cindication\nand recommended dosing [more] than the hypothetical abuse-\ndeterrent properties of [the drug\u2019s] formulation.\u201d J.A. 890. In\nother words, PMRS did not submit additional evidence to\nsupport the label\u2019s statements concerning the drug\u2019s physical\nand chemical properties. Instead, the company insisted that its\nproduct carried less potential for abuse because it would be\nindicated only for acute, rather than long-term, pain\nmanagement, and because the label would recommend a\nmaximum daily dosage that was lower than similar opioids\nalready on the market. According to PMRS, the acute pain\nindication coupled with lower dosing recommendations would\nmake its drug \u201cthe safest labeled opioid\u201d on the market. J.A.\n575. PMRS also argued that the FDA\u2019s approach to abuse\ndeterrence, as laid out in the 2015 Guidance, was \u201cmisleading,\nunscientific, and dangerous,\u201d J.A. 575, and that a hearing was\nneeded to address the flaws in the agency\u2019s approach.\n\n     In June 2018, the FDA sent PMRS a draft order\nproposing denial of PMRS\u2019s application and hearing request.\nThe draft order reiterated the deficiencies identified in the\ncomplete response letter and explained that PMRS had failed\nto identify a genuine factual issue that would justify a hearing.\nThe agency described numerous statutory grounds on which\nto deny the NDA, including that PMRS\u2019s proposed label was\nfalse and misleading given the lack of scientific support for\nthe label\u2019s statements about abuse deterrence.\n\n     Two months after receiving the proposed order, PMRS\nfiled a response in which it suggested modifying the draft\nlabel to read, as relevant here:\n\n         Oxycodone HC1 IR ADF capsule is\n         formulated with inactive ingredients\n\f                               7\n         intended to make the capsule more difficult\n         to manipulate for misuse and/or abuse.\n         Postmarketing epidemiology evidence is\n         required to demonstrate meaningful abuse-\n         deterrent properties. Oxycodone HC1 IR\n         ADF capsules should be prescribed\n         knowing meaningful abuse-deterrent\n         properties have not been proven.\n\nJ.A. 893 (emphasis in original).\n\n     The FDA issued a final order denying PMRS\u2019s request\nfor a hearing and refusing to approve its NDA in October\n2018.

We\nexplain in turn why each APA challenge fails.\n\n                              A.\n\n     As a preliminary matter, PMRS asserts that the FDA\u2019s\nrefusal to approve its application was contrary to law because\nthe FDCA does not permit the agency to deny an NDA solely\non the basis of a false or misleading label.\n\n     As with all questions of statutory interpretation, we start\nwith the text. See, e.g., Ross v. Blake, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1850</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1856\n(2016). The FDCA provides first that the FDA \u201cshall \u2026\napprove [a new drug] application if [the agency] finds that\nnone of the grounds for denying approval specified in\nsubsection (d) applies.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(c)(1)(A) (emphasis\nadded). Subsection (d), in turn, provides that the FDA \u201cshall\nissue an order refusing to approve [an] application\u201d if it finds\nthat one of seven grounds\u2014enumerated in subsections (d)(1)\nthrough (d)(7)\u2014exists.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span> \u00a7 355(d) </span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">(emphasis added).\nSubsection (d)(7) covers situations in which the FDA\nconcludes, \u201cbased on a fair evaluation of all material facts,\u201d\nthat the applicant\u2019s proposed labeling \u201cis false or misleading\nin any particular.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span> \u00a7 355(d)</span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">(7). Together, these provisions\nindicate that any of the seven grounds for denial specified in\nsubsection (d) is a basis on which the agency must deny an\napplication; if none of these grounds applies, the application\nmust be approved.\n\n     The sentence following the seven grounds for denial,\nhowever, complicates matters. It states that if the FDA \u201cfinds\nthat clauses (1) through (6) do not apply, [the agency] shall\nissue an order approving the application.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span> \u00a7 355(d)\n</span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">(emphasis added). Read in isolation, this sentence would\nsuggest that subsection (d)(7)\u2014the false or misleading\nlabeling provision\u2014does not furnish a sufficient basis,\n\f                              10\nstanding alone, to deny an application. Yet this clause is in\ndirect conflict with the language in Section 355(c) and (d)\ndiscussed above, which requires the agency to deny an\napplication on any of the seven grounds, including false or\nmisleading labeling. The statute does not explain this internal\ninconsistency, and there is no other language in Section 355\nsuggesting that subsection (d)(7) should be treated differently\nfrom the other six grounds for denial.\n\n    PMRS contends that the reference to \u201cclauses (1) through\n(6)\u201d in Section 355(d) means the FDA cannot refuse to\napprove an NDA based solely on a false or misleading label.\nHere, the agency relied exclusively on subsection (d)(7) in\ndenying PMRS\u2019s application. PMRS argues that the Denial\nOrder therefore contravened the plain text of the FDCA and\nwas contrary to law within the meaning of the APA. See 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n     The FDA responds that this inconsistency in the text\nreflects a scrivener\u2019s error resulting from a 1984 amendment\nto the FDCA that added a seventh ground for denying a new\ndrug application. In the pre-1984 version of the statute, the\nfalse or misleading label provision appeared at subsection\n(d)(6) and was followed by the same reference to \u201cclauses (1)\nthrough (6)\u201d that appears in the current version. In other\nwords, under the prior iteration of Section 355(d), a false or\nmisleading label was a sufficient ground for denying an\napplication. Congress amended the statute by inserting a new\nground for denial at subsection (d)(6) and moving the false or\nmisleading labeling clause to (d)(7)\u2014but it left unchanged the\nreference to \u201cclauses (1) through (6)\u201d in the sentence that\nfollows. Compare 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (1982), with 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(d) (1988). The FDA maintains that nothing in the\ncurrent statute indicates that Congress intended this\nrenumbering to alter the longstanding statutory scheme by\n\f                              11\npermitting the FDA, for the first time, to approve an\napplication that proposes false or misleading labeling. Indeed,\nthe remainder of Section 355 directly contradicts that\ninterpretation. Thus, the FDA maintains the only plausible\nreading is that Congress simply neglected to update one\nclause of Section 355(d) to include the renumbered ground\n(7).\n\n     We agree with the FDA that a false or misleading label is\na sufficient ground for denial. As written, Section 355 states\nan irreconcilable contradiction\u2014two provisions indicate that\nthe agency can deny an application based only on false or\nmisleading labeling, but another suggests it cannot. While we\ncannot \u201cjudicially amend[] a statute \u2018to provide for what [we]\nmight think \u2026 is the preferred result,\u2019\u201d this case represents a\nrare situation where \u201cthere is no plausible reading of the plain\ntext absent recognizing and correcting for the error.\u201d United\nStates v.

But it fails\nto identify any examples of the FDA approving an NDA on\nthe basis of significant labeling revisions proposed after a\nhearing request, particularly where there was no evidence\nshowing the formulation had any abuse deterrent properties.\nIndeed, in the only arguably analogous example PMRS points\nto, the FDA approved an opioid formulation with an amended\nlabel describing the drug\u2019s abuse deterrent properties only\nafter finding that the applicant \u201cprovided sufficient data to\ndemonstrate that the \u2026 formulation appears to provide an\nincremental decrease in\u201d persistent nasal abuse.

For\nmany of the reasons discussed in Part II.B, we find the FDA\nacted within its discretion in denying PMRS\u2019s hearing\nrequest.\n\n    As already explained, the FDA considered PMRS\u2019s\napplication and reasonably determined that there was no\nevidence to support PMRS\u2019s claim that its product had an\nabuse deterrent \u201cformulation.\u201d PMRS\u2019s evidence regarding\nduration and dosing therefore could not remedy the false and\nmisleading nature of its draft label, which focused on the\nproduct\u2019s chemical and physical properties. This meant that\nPMRS\u2019s alternative evidence, even if considered, necessarily\ncould not create a \u201cgenuine and substantial issue of fact\u201d that,\nif resolved in PMRS\u2019s favor, would justify approval of\n\f                              22\nPMRS\u2019s application. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.24(b). In other words,\nbecause PMRS\u2019s proffered evidence created no relevant\nfactual dispute, it did not provide a basis on which to grant a\nhearing. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Copanos,</span> <span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">523</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     Nor can we conclude that PMRS\u2019s eleventh hour attempt\nto modify its proposed label created a genuine issue of fact\nrequiring a hearing.

As already\nnoted, we find the FDA\u2019s explanation for its refusal to\nconsider revisions at this late stage to be reasonable. See\nsupra at 16\u201317.\n\n     Finally, we do not believe the FDA exceeded its\ndiscretion in refusing to grant PMRS\u2019s request for a hearing\non broader policy issues related to the problem of opioid\nabuse deterrence. PMRS might be dissatisfied with the\nagency\u2019s overall approach, but the FDA\u2019s regulations make\nclear that \u201ca hearing will not be granted on issues of policy\nand law.\u201d See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 12.24(b)(1).

Helvin, Attorney, U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission, entered an appearance.\n\n   Before: WILKINS, Circuit Judge, and WILLIAMS and\nSENTELLE, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n    Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge WILKINS.\n\n    Opinion concurring in the judgment filed by Senior Circuit\nJudge WILLIAMS.\n\n     WILKINS, Circuit Judge: In 2012 the Securities and\nExchange Commission prosecuted Bernerd Young for multiple\nsecurities violations based on his participation in a multi-billion\ndollar Ponzi scheme between 2006 and 2009, during the height\nof the financial crisis. After a hearing, an administrative law\njudge (ALJ) found him liable on most of the charges and\nimposed various penalties, including disgorgement of nearly\n$600,000, which represented about half of the compensation he\nreceived between 2006 and 2009. The Commission affirmed\nthe ALJ\u2019s decision, and Young filed a petition for review.\nHowever, he filed his petition in the District of Columbia Court\nof Appeals, which is the wrong court. By the time he realized\nhis mistake and filed the petition in our Court, the sixty-day\ndeadline for filing had passed.\n\n      We do not pass upon whether the statutory time limit to\nfile a petition for review is jurisdictional and subject to\nequitable tolling. Instead, we conclude that, even assuming it\nis a non-mandatory claims processing rule, Young has failed to\ndemonstrate entitlement to equitable tolling. Filing a petition\nfor review in a state court that clearly lacks jurisdiction over\nthe petition does not toll the deadline for filing in our Court.\nAnd because no extraordinary circumstance beyond his control\n\f                               3\nprevented him from timely filing in our Court, he is not entitled\nto equitable tolling, and we must dismiss his petition.\n\n                              I.\n\n     From 2006 to 2009, Bernerd Young was the Chief\nCompliance Officer at Stanford Group Company (\u201cSGC\u201d).\nSGC was an affiliate of Stanford Financial Group (\u201cSFG\u201d), a\nnetwork of companies controlled by Allen Stanford. Based in\nHouston, SGC was a dually registered investment adviser and\nbroker-dealer that heavily marketed to U.S. investors so-called\n\u201ccertificates of deposit\u201d (\u201cCDs\u201d). These CDs were issued by\nanother SFG affiliate: Stanford International Bank Limited\n(\u201cSIB\u201d), an offshore Antiguan bank established by Allen\nStanford.     As Chief Compliance Officer, Young was\nresponsible for ensuring the accuracy of SGC\u2019s statements in\npromoting these CDs. The CDs, which accounted for 55.38%\nof SGC\u2019s revenue between 2006 and 2009, purported to be\n\u201cinvested in diversified and liquid holdings\u201d that generated\n\u201cconsistent above-market returns\u201d for investors. J.A. 166. In\nfact, however, SIB was operating a Ponzi scheme.\n\n    SIB supported its CDs with \u201cdetailed marketing materials\nand annual reports showing steady growth.\u201d United States v.\nStanford, 805 F.3d 557, 564 (5th Cir. 2015). Meanwhile, Allen\nStanford \u201cspent lavishly, purchasing boats, mansions, and\npersonal aircraft and sponsoring high-dollar cricket\ntournaments.\u201d Id. The scheme collapsed in 2009, when new\nCD investments became insufficient to cover the interest and\nredemption payments owed to current SIB investors. Id. The\nCommission promptly instituted a civil action against Allen\nStanford, SIB, and other companies and persons involved in the\nsale and promotion of the CDs, alleging an $8 billion\nfraudulent scheme. In March 2012, Stanford was convicted of\nnumerous federal crimes and sentenced to 110 years in prison,\n\f                                4\nid. at 565, and he was later ordered to disgorge $5.9 billion in\nill-gotten gains, SEC v. Stanford Int\u2019l Bank, Ltd., et.al., No.\n3:09-CV-0298-N, 2013 WL 12360438, at *5 (N.D. Tex. Apr.\n25, 2013).\n\n     In August 2012, after a lengthy investigation, the\nCommission instituted proceedings against Young and two\nother former officers of SGC, charging them with various\nviolations of federal securities laws. Young was represented\nby counsel before an ALJ. 1 Following a fifteen-day hearing, at\nwhich 26 witnesses testified and over 350 exhibits were\npresented, the ALJ issued an initial decision in August 2013,\nwhich found Young and the other two respondents liable on\nmost of the charges.\n\n     Specifically, the ALJ concluded that Young and the other\ntwo respondents negligently failed to conduct reasonable\ndiligence in investigating the CDs. Despite this lack of\ndiligence, Young and the respondents approved SGC\u2019s use of\nmaterials that misrepresented material facts to investors about\nthe liquidity of SIB\u2019s underlying investment portfolio. Later,\nclients and potential clients began expressing concerns that\nSIB\u2019s model was indicative of a Ponzi scheme akin to the one\nBernie Madoff had recently been caught orchestrating, and that\nAntiguan regulators were being corruptly influenced by Allen\nStanford. 2 The ALJ concluded that, after hearing these\nconcerns, Young and the other respondents \u201cdecided that SGC\nshould \u2018attack\u2019 with talking points,\u201d rather than \u201cinvestigate\nthe[ir] possible truthfulness.\u201d J.A. 51. As the ALJ explained,\n\n1\n  At that time, \u201cthe Commission had left the task of appointing\nALJs \u2026 to SEC staff members.\u201d Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044,\n2050 (2018). Neither the President nor the Commission itself played\nany role in this selection and appointment process.\n2\n  Indeed, Young himself admitted at the hearing that he suspected\nAntiguan regulators might be under Allen Stanford\u2019s influence.\n\f                                5\nthey \u201cwent on a damage control road show,\u201d J.A. 52, designed\nto \u201clull customers so as to forestall redemptions and continue\nsales of the SIB CD.\u201d J.A. 51.\n\n     The ALJ imposed multiple sanctions against Young and\nthe other two respondents. The ALJ (1) ordered them to cease\nand desist from committing or causing any future violations of\nthe securities laws at issue; (2) imposed a civil penalty of\n$260,000; and (3) permanently barred them from working in\nthe securities industry. In addition, the ALJ ordered Young to\ndisgorge $591,992.46, or 55.38% of the $1,068,964.36 in\npayroll compensation he received from SGC between 2006 and\n2009.\n\n     The other two respondents did not seek Commission\nreview of the ALJ\u2019s decision, but Young did. Now proceeding\npro se, Young timely petitioned the Commission for review in\nSeptember 2013. On March 24, 2016, the Commission issued\na unanimous opinion and order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision\nand the penalties.\n\n     Young had sixty days to seek review of the Commission\u2019s\ndecision, either from our Circuit or the circuit in which he\nresides or maintains his principal place of business. See 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77i(a), 78y(a)(1), 80b-13(a), and 80a-42(a). On May\n23, 2016, the last day to file, he filed a petition for review, but\nfiled it with the wrong court \u2013 the District of Columbia Court\nof Appeals (DCCA). Young had previously contacted the\nDCCA and received instructions on how to file a petition there.\nOn May 24, the DCCA contacted Young and informed him of\nhis error. Young, who happened to be in Washington, D.C. at\nthe time, retrieved his petition from the DCCA and refiled it in\nour Court later that same day \u2013 one day too late. Young\u2019s\npetition was docketed, and we issued an order to show cause\nwhy the petition should not be dismissed for lack of\n\f                               6\njurisdiction. After Young explained the circumstances, we\ndischarged the order to show cause and directed the parties to\naddress our jurisdiction in their merits briefs.\n\n     During briefing, we granted the Commission\u2019s motion to\nhold the case in abeyance pending the resolution of Lucia v.\nSEC, in which the Supreme Court ultimately held that SEC\nALJs are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under the\nAppointments Clause, and that ALJs not appointed by the\nPresident were thus unconstitutionally appointed. 138 S. Ct. at\n2053. Thereafter, the parties filed motions to govern further\nproceedings. In his motion, Young sought leave to file a\nsupplemental brief addressing both Lucia and Kokesh v. SEC,\nin which the Supreme Court held that the five-year statute of\nlimitations for any \u201caction, suit or proceeding for the\nenforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary\nor otherwise\u201d applies to disgorgement imposed as a sanction\nfor violating a federal securities law. 137 S. Ct. 1635, 1643\n(2017) (interpreting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462). Given the new\ncomplexity of the case, we appointed amicus curiae on March\n4, 2019 to present arguments in support of Young\u2019s position,\nand we entered a new briefing schedule. The case is now ready\nfor our consideration.\n\n                              II.\n\n     Before we may consider the merits of Young\u2019s petition,\nwe must determine whether a basis exists to excuse his\npetition\u2019s untimeliness.\n\n     As an initial matter, Amicus argues that because Young\u2019s\npetition complied with every requirement except for the place\nof filing, his petition was, in effect, in compliance with the\nsixty-day deadline. We disagree.\n\f                                7\n     Amicus relies on Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Company,\n487 U.S. 312, 316-17 (1988), and Anderson v. District of\nColumbia, 72 F.3d 166, 167 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (per curiam), but\nthese cases speak to petitions that are timely filed in the correct\ncourt but contain some technical defect. In Torres, the\nSupreme Court explained that where \u201ca litigant files papers in\na fashion that is technically at variance with the letter of a\nprocedural rule, a court may nonetheless find that the litigant\nhas complied with the rule if the litigant\u2019s action is the\nfunctional equivalent of what the rule requires.\u201d 487 U.S. at\n316-17 (citations omitted). Relying on this principle, our Court\nlater held that an appellant who had \u201ctimely filed a notice of\nappeal in the district court but improperly designated the\nUnited States Supreme Court as the court to which the appeal\nwas taken\u201d had functionally complied with the filing\nrequirements. Anderson, 72 F.3d at 167-68 (\u201c[A] defective\nnotice of appeal does not warrant dismissal where the intention\nto appeal to a certain court of appeals may be inferred from the\nnotice and where the defect has not materially misled the\nappellee.\u201d). Unlike the appellant in Anderson, however, Young\ndid not timely file a petition in our court that happened to have\nsome technical defect. Rather, he did not timely file a petition\nin our court at all.\n\n     Amicus next argues that, even if the petition was untimely,\nthe deadline is not jurisdictional and we may excuse the\npetition\u2019s untimeliness in these circumstances.\n\n     Filing deadlines fall into one of three categories:\n(1) jurisdictional deadlines, which cannot be equitably tolled\nby the court or waived by an opposing party, (2) mandatory\nclaims-processing deadlines, which are subject to equitable\ntolling unless properly raised by an opposing party, in which\ncase they are unalterable, or (3) nonmandatory claims-\nprocessing deadlines, which are both subject to equitable\n\f                               8\ntolling and flexible when raised by an opposing party. Bowles\nv. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 213 (2007); Nutraceutical Corp. v.\nLambert, 139 S. Ct. 710, 714 (2019). Here, the SEC argues\nthat the time limit is jurisdictional, while Amicus argues that\nthe time limit is a nonmandatory claims-processing rule. We\nneed not resolve this dispute, however, because even assuming\nthe time limit is both nonjurisdictional and nonmandatory,\nYoung cannot show entitlement to equitable tolling. See Coal\nRiver Energy, LLC v. Jewell, 751 F.3d 659, 663 (D.C. Cir.\n2014) (declining to decide whether a statute of limitations is\njurisdictional because the appellant failed to establish\nentitlement to equitable tolling); see also Norman v. United\nStates, 467 F.3d 773, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (same).\n\n     The party arguing for equitable tolling bears the burden of\ndemonstrating entitlement to it. United States v. Saro, 252 F.3d\n449, 454 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \u201cGenerally, a litigant seeking\nequitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements:\n(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that\nsome extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\u201d Pace v.\nDiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 418 (2005) (citations omitted).\n\u201cTo count as sufficiently \u2018extraordinary\u2019 to support equitable\ntolling, the circumstances that caused a litigant\u2019s delay must\nhave been beyond its control.\u201d Menominee Indian Tribe of\nWis. v. United States, 764 F.3d 51, 58 (D.C. Cir. 2014), aff\u2019d,\n136 S. Ct. 750 (2016). Relevant here, \u201c[t]he circumstance that\nstood in a litigant\u2019s way cannot be a product of that litigant\u2019s\nown misunderstanding of the law or tactical mistakes in\nlitigation.\u201d Id.\n\n    To meet this heavy burden, Amicus primarily relies on\nBurnett v. New York Central Railroad Company, 380 U.S. 424\n(1965). In that case, the petitioner filed an action under the\nFederal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA) in an Ohio state\ncourt that had concurrent jurisdiction over the action. Id. at\n\f                                9\n424-25. However, the state court dismissed his action because\nvenue was improper. Id. at 425. Eight days later, he filed an\nidentical action in an Ohio federal court. Id. This time, the\ncomplaint was dismissed because \u201calthough the state suit was\nbrought within [FELA\u2019s] limitations period, the federal action\nwas not.\u201d Id. The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal, but\nthe Supreme Court reversed. Id. at 424-26. Specifically, the\nCourt concluded that \u201cwhen a plaintiff begins a timely FELA\naction in a state court of competent jurisdiction, service of\nprocess is made upon the opposing party, and the state court\naction is later dismissed because of improper venue, the FELA\nlimitation is tolled during the pendency of the state action.\u201d Id.\nat 428.\n\n     The SEC argues that Burnett does not apply here, because\nthe plaintiff in that case filed his claim in a court of \u201ccompetent\njurisdiction\u201d \u2013 that is, a state court with concurrent jurisdiction\nover the claim. SEC Resp. Br. at 35. We agree. In Burnett,\n\u201c[t]here [wa]s no doubt that, as a matter of federal law,\u201d the\nplaintiff\u2019s action \u201cwas properly \u2018commenced\u2019 within the\nmeaning of the federal limitation statute.\u201d 380 U.S. at 426.\nTherefore, the plaintiff \u201cdid not sleep on his rights but brought\nan action within the statutory period in the state court of\ncompetent jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 429. The only reason that the\nplaintiff had to refile his suit in federal court was because Ohio\nstate law did not allow such an action to be transferred to a\nfederal court. Id. at 426. By contrast, Young\u2019s petition was\nnot \u201cproperly commenced,\u201d because it was not filed in a court\nwith concurrent jurisdiction over it. See id. at 426, 429.\n\n     Every circuit that has considered the question before us has\nheld that filing an action in a state court or federal agency that\nclearly lacks jurisdiction over the action does not toll the time\nfor filing in federal court. See Thompson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc.\nSec. Admin., 919 F.3d 1033, 1037 (8th Cir. 2019) (\u201cThe\n\f                                 10\nrationale of [Burnett] does not extend to a situation like this one\nunder [42 U.S.C] \u00a7 405(g), where federal courts have exclusive\njurisdiction over a claim, and the complainant mistakenly\ncorresponds with an agency rather than a court of competent\njurisdiction.\u201d); Jackson v. Astrue, 506 F.3d 1349, 1357 (11th\nCir. 2007) (affirming dismissal of action under 42 U.S.C.\n405(g) because \u201c[t]he [state court] in which [the appellant]\nfiled her claim was not a court of competent jurisdiction over\nher claim\u201d); Gibson v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co., 289 F.3d 943, 946\n(6th Cir. 2002) (\u201cWe agree with the district court that plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims . . . were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal\ndistrict court and, therefore, the filing in state court did not toll\nthe statute of limitations.\u201d); Shofer v. Hack Co., 970 F.2d 1316,\n1319 (4th Cir. 1992) (\u201cThe commencement of an action in a\nclearly inappropriate forum, a court that clearly lacks\njurisdiction, will not toll the statute of limitations. . . . Because\nthe state court clearly lacked jurisdiction over the ERISA\nfiduciary duty claims, Burnett . . . [does] not apply, and\nequitable tolling under federal tolling principles is not\nappropriate in this case.\u201d). We now join them.\n\n     To be sure, where a litigant \u201creasonably believe[s]\u201d that\nthe state court possesses concurrent jurisdiction over a federal\nclaim, courts will toll the limitations period from the filing of\nthe state action. See Fox v. Eaton Corp., 615 F.2d 716, 719-21\n(6th Cir. 1980) (\u201c[A]s a general matter, the filing of an action\nin a court that clearly lacks jurisdiction will not toll the statute\nof limitations. But in this case, the lack of jurisdiction in the\nstate court was far from clear.\u201d); see also Valenzuela v. Kraft,\nInc., 801 F.2d 1170, 1175 (9th Cir. 1986) (\u201cAt the time\nValenzuela filed her action in state court it was unclear whether\nfederal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over Title VII\nclaims. . . . Tolling the 90-day filing period in this case is\nconsistent with the remedial purpose of Title VII legislation.\u201d).\nBut this is not such a case. There was no reasonable basis for\n\f                                 11\nYoung to believe that the DCCA possessed concurrent\njurisdiction over a petition for review of an SEC order.\n\n     Amicus also invokes Young\u2019s pro se status as a\njustification for his confusing two similarly named courts. But\nignorance of the law is not an appropriate basis for equitable\ntolling. See United States v. Cicero, 214 F.3d 199, 203 (D.C.\nCir. 2000) (\u201c[I]gnorance of the law or unfamiliarity with the\nlegal process will not excuse [a litigant\u2019s] untimely filing, nor\nwill a lack of representation during the applicable filing\nperiod.\u201d) (citations omitted); Richards v. Mileski, 662 F.2d 65,\n71 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\u201c[M]ere ignorance of the law does\nnot ordinarily toll the statute of limitations.\u201d). Rather,\nequitable tolling is appropriate \u201conly in \u2018rare instances where\u2014\ndue to circumstances external to the party\u2019s own conduct\u2014it\nwould be unconscionable to enforce the limitation period\nagainst the party and gross injustice would result.\u2019\u201d Head v.\nWilson, 792 F.3d 102, 111 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Whiteside\nv. United States, 775 F.3d 180, 184 (4th Cir. 2014)). No\nextraordinary circumstance beyond Young\u2019s control stood in\nhis way. Instead, his mistake is a \u201cgarden variety claim of\nexcusable neglect.\u201d 3 See Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs,\n498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990).\n\n    Finally, Amicus lays the blame at the feet of the DCCA,\narguing that \u201cYoung\u2019s confusion was likely compounded\u201d\n\n3\n  It is of no moment that Young\u2019s mistake \u201ccaused no prejudice\u201d to\nthe SEC. Amicus\u2019s Opening Br. at 33. \u201cAlthough absence of\nprejudice is a factor to be considered in determining whether the\ndoctrine of equitable tolling should apply once a factor that might\njustify such tolling is identified, it is not an independent basis for\ninvoking the doctrine and sanctioning deviations from established\nprocedures.\u201d Baldwin Cty. Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147,\n152 (1984). Because Young cannot identify a basis that might justify\nequitable tolling, we don\u2019t consider the absence of prejudice here.\n\f                               12\nwhen, prior to his filing deadline, he contacted the DCCA to\nobtain instructions on how to file his petition, and the DCCA\nfailed to correct his misunderstanding about where to file it.\nAmicus Opening Br. at 32. This argument, too, lacks merit.\n\n     \u201c[W]e have excused parties who were misled about the\nrunning of a limitations period, whether by an adversary\u2019s\nactions, by a government official\u2019s advice upon which they\nreasonably relied, or by inaccurate or ineffective notice from a\ngovernment agency required to provide notice of the\nlimitations period[.]\u201d Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d 433,\n438 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citations omitted). Even assuming\nYoung told the DCCA\u2019s clerk\u2019s office that he wanted to seek\nreview of an SEC order (a fact he does not allege), he does not\nclaim that the DCCA affirmatively \u201cmisled\u201d him in any way.\nId. at 438; see also Dyson v. D.C., 710 F.3d 415, 422 (D.C. Cir.\n2013) (rejecting claim for equitable tolling because the\nappellant did not allege \u201cthat either the EEOC or the District of\nColumbia misled her as to her filing deadline\u201d). Moreover, to\nthe extent Amicus invokes the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d\ndoctrine, that doctrine applies only where a party is \u201clulled into\nmissing the deadline by a formal court order or ruling\u201d and does\nnot apply to \u201cstatements made by the clerk\u2019s office staff,\u201d see\nMoore v. S.C. Labor Bd., 100 F.3d 162, 162, 164 (D.C. Cir.\n1996), much less the clerk\u2019s office of another court without\nconcurrent jurisdiction.\n\n                               III.\n\n     Because no extraordinary circumstances beyond Young\u2019s\ncontrol prevented him from timely filing his petition for\nreview, he is not entitled to equitable tolling, and we dismiss\nhis petition.\n\nSo ordered.\n\f     WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge\u00b8 concurring in the\njudgment: Four statutes authorize a party in the position of Mr.\nYoung to secure review of an adverse SEC order in the court of\nappeals where he resides, or in this court, by filing a petition in\nsuch court within 60 days. See Securities Act of 1933, \u00a7 9(a),\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77i(a); Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \u00a7 25(a),\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a); Investment Company Act of 1940, \u00a7 43(a),\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-42(a); Investment Advisers Act of 1940,\n\u00a7 213(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-13(a). It is undisputed that on the\nlast possible day Mr. Young filed a petition\u2014not in the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit but\nin the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. He filed the next\nday in our court, one day late.\n\n     I believe that our decision in New York Republican State\nCommittee v. SEC, 799 F.3d 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2015), correctly\nruled that one of the four relevant statutes, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-\n13(a), did not create a jurisdictional bar precluding the exercise\nof equitable tolling. \u201cWe may equitably toll a statutory\ndeadline unless Congress has shown its intent to withdraw our\njurisdiction once a deadline is missed.\u201d Id. at 1134 (citing\nArbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 515\u201316 (2006), and\nMenominee Indian Tribe v. United States, 614 F.3d 519, 523\u2013\n25 (D.C. Cir. 2010)).\n\n     The Court\u2019s decision in Arbaugh had created a \u201cclear\nstatement\u201d rule to the effect that statutory requirements,\nincluding timing deadlines, were not to be deemed\njurisdictional unless \u201cthe Legislature clearly states that a\nthreshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as\njurisdictional . . . But when Congress does not rank a statutory\nlimitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the\nrestriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\u201d 546 U.S. at 515\u2013\n16. Absent a clear statement to the contrary, filing deadlines\n\f                                2\n\nare \u201c\u2018quintessential claim-processing rules,\u2019 which \u2018seek to\npromote the orderly progress of litigation,\u2019 but do not deprive\na court of authority to hear a case.\u201d United States v. Kwai Fun\nWong, 575 U.S. 402, 410 (2015) (quoting Henderson v.\nShinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 435 (2011)).\n\n     The SEC\u2019s misplaced reliance on Bowles v. Russell, 551\nU.S. 205 (2007), ignores that the holding there rests on a\n\u201ccentury\u2019s worth of precedent and practice in American\ncourts,\u201d id. at 209\u201310 n.2, treating an appeal from one Article\nIII court to another as jurisdictional; \u201cBowles did not hold\ncategorically that every deadline for seeking judicial review in\ncivil litigation is jurisdictional,\u201d Henderson, 562 U.S. at 436.\nAlthough the Investment Advisers Act makes clear that this\ncourt has jurisdiction \u201c[u]pon the filing of such petition,\u201d 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7 80b-13(a), that language cannot be said to clearly\nmake the sixty-day filing deadline jurisdictional. And the three\nstatutes other than 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-13(a), which employ\nsimilar language, provide no more linguistic basis for a court to\ndub them jurisdictional than does 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-13(a).\n\n     Having found equitable tolling available in principle in\nNew York Republican State Committee, however, we declined\nto find any reason to apply it; the filing was four years late and\nthe plaintiff failed to show either diligence or any kind of\nextraordinary obstacle to timely filing.\n\n     But although New York Republican State Committee is\nrightly considered a holding that the statutory filing deadline in\nquestion was consistent with equitable tolling, there is a further\nobstacle, not invoked by the SEC in that case: Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 26(b)(2) provides that the court may not\nextend the time to file\n\n    a notice of appeal from or a petition to enjoin, set\n    aside, suspend, modify, enforce, or otherwise review\n\f                               3\n\n    an order of an administrative agency, board,\n    commission, or officer of the United States, unless\n    specifically authorized by law.\n\nFed. Rule App. Proc. 26(b)(2) (emphasis added). \u201cIn other\nwords, Appellate Rule 26(b) says that the deadline for the\nprecise type of filing at issue here may not be extended.\u201d\nNutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert, 139 S. Ct. 710, 715 (2019)\n(applying the parallel language of Rule 26(b)(1) to petitions for\npermission to appeal authorized by Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(f)). See also Kern v. SEC, 724 F. App\u2019x 687, 688\n(10th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (holding that Rule 26(b)(2) bars\ntolling of time to file a petition for review of an SEC order\nunder 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77i, 78y(a)(1), 80b-13).\n\n    Amicus for Mr. Young argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\nprovides exactly the \u201cspecific[] authoriz[ation]\u201d required by\nRule 26(b)(2). But \u00a7 1631 allows transfers only from a court\n\u201cas defined in section 610 of this title.\u201d Section 610, in turn,\nenumerates exclusively a set of federal courts, rendering\n\u00a7 1631 useless to Mr. Young and leaving no specific\nauthorization of the sort required by Rule 26(b)(2).\n\n     Although I read the controlling materials as barring our\napplication of equitable tolling, I\u2019m by no means confident that\nI would deny such tolling if the avenue were open to us. Mr.\nYoung was proceeding pro se; within the allowed 60 days he\nfiled a petition for review in the local court carrying a name\nalmost identical to that of this court, an identity that\nunderstandably \u201chas led to immense confusion to this day.\u201d\nJohn G. Roberts, Jr., What Makes the D.C. Circuit Different? A\nHistorical View, 92 Va. L. Rev. 375, 388 (2006). The nearness\nof Mr. Young\u2019s miss, both in time (one day) and the names of\nthe courts, coupled with his pro se status, present a fairly\ncompelling case for equitable tolling.

After a hearing, an administrative law\njudge (ALJ) found him liable on most of the charges and\nimposed various penalties, including disgorgement of nearly\n$600,000, which represented about half of the compensation he\nreceived between 2006 and 2009. The Commission affirmed\nthe ALJ\u2019s decision, and Young filed a petition for review.\nHowever, he filed his petition in the District of Columbia Court\nof Appeals, which is the wrong court. By the time he realized\nhis mistake and filed the petition in our Court, the sixty-day\ndeadline for filing had passed.\n\n      We do not pass upon whether the statutory time limit to\nfile a petition for review is jurisdictional and subject to\nequitable tolling. Instead, we conclude that, even assuming it\nis a non-mandatory claims processing rule, Young has failed to\ndemonstrate entitlement to equitable tolling. Filing a petition\nfor review in a state court that clearly lacks jurisdiction over\nthe petition does not toll the deadline for filing in our Court.\nAnd because no extraordinary circumstance beyond his control\n\f                               3\nprevented him from timely filing in our Court, he is not entitled\nto equitable tolling, and we must dismiss his petition.\n\n                              I.\n\n     From 2006 to 2009, Bernerd Young was the Chief\nCompliance Officer at Stanford Group Company (\u201cSGC\u201d).\nSGC was an affiliate of Stanford Financial Group (\u201cSFG\u201d), a\nnetwork of companies controlled by Allen Stanford. Based in\nHouston, SGC was a dually registered investment adviser and\nbroker-dealer that heavily marketed to U.S. investors so-called\n\u201ccertificates of deposit\u201d (\u201cCDs\u201d). These CDs were issued by\nanother SFG affiliate: Stanford International Bank Limited\n(\u201cSIB\u201d), an offshore Antiguan bank established by Allen\nStanford.     As Chief Compliance Officer, Young was\nresponsible for ensuring the accuracy of SGC\u2019s statements in\npromoting these CDs. The CDs, which accounted for 55.38%\nof SGC\u2019s revenue between 2006 and 2009, purported to be\n\u201cinvested in diversified and liquid holdings\u201d that generated\n\u201cconsistent above-market returns\u201d for investors.

Tex. Apr.\n25, 2013).\n\n     In August 2012, after a lengthy investigation, the\nCommission instituted proceedings against Young and two\nother former officers of SGC, charging them with various\nviolations of federal securities laws. Young was represented\nby counsel before an ALJ. 1 Following a fifteen-day hearing, at\nwhich 26 witnesses testified and over 350 exhibits were\npresented, the ALJ issued an initial decision in August 2013,\nwhich found Young and the other two respondents liable on\nmost of the charges.\n\n     Specifically, the ALJ concluded that Young and the other\ntwo respondents negligently failed to conduct reasonable\ndiligence in investigating the CDs. Despite this lack of\ndiligence, Young and the respondents approved SGC\u2019s use of\nmaterials that misrepresented material facts to investors about\nthe liquidity of SIB\u2019s underlying investment portfolio. Later,\nclients and potential clients began expressing concerns that\nSIB\u2019s model was indicative of a Ponzi scheme akin to the one\nBernie Madoff had recently been caught orchestrating, and that\nAntiguan regulators were being corruptly influenced by Allen\nStanford. 2 The ALJ concluded that, after hearing these\nconcerns, Young and the other respondents \u201cdecided that SGC\nshould \u2018attack\u2019 with talking points,\u201d rather than \u201cinvestigate\nthe[ir] possible truthfulness.\u201d J.A. 51. As the ALJ explained,\n\n1\n  At that time, \u201cthe Commission had left the task of appointing\nALJs \u2026 to SEC staff members.\u201d Lucia v. SEC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2044</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n2050 (2018). Neither the President nor the Commission itself played\nany role in this selection and appointment process.\n2\n  Indeed, Young himself admitted at the hearing that he suspected\nAntiguan regulators might be under Allen Stanford\u2019s influence.\n\f                                5\nthey \u201cwent on a damage control road show,\u201d J.A. 52, designed\nto \u201clull customers so as to forestall redemptions and continue\nsales of the SIB CD.\u201d J.A. 51.\n\n     The ALJ imposed multiple sanctions against Young and\nthe other two respondents. The ALJ (1) ordered them to cease\nand desist from committing or causing any future violations of\nthe securities laws at issue; (2) imposed a civil penalty of\n$260,000; and (3) permanently barred them from working in\nthe securities industry. In addition, the ALJ ordered Young to\ndisgorge $591,992.46, or 55.38% of the $1,068,964.36 in\npayroll compensation he received from SGC between 2006 and\n2009.\n\n     The other two respondents did not seek Commission\nreview of the ALJ\u2019s decision, but Young did. Now proceeding\npro se, Young timely petitioned the Commission for review in\nSeptember 2013. On March 24, 2016, the Commission issued\na unanimous opinion and order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision\nand the penalties.\n\n     Young had sixty days to seek review of the Commission\u2019s\ndecision, either from our Circuit or the circuit in which he\nresides or maintains his principal place of business. See 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77i(a), 78y(a)(1), 80b-13(a), and 80a-42(a). On May\n23, 2016, the last day to file, he filed a petition for review, but\nfiled it with the wrong court \u2013 the District of Columbia Court\nof Appeals (DCCA). Young had previously contacted the\nDCCA and received instructions on how to file a petition there.\nOn May 24, the DCCA contacted Young and informed him of\nhis error. Young, who happened to be in Washington, D.C. at\nthe time, retrieved his petition from the DCCA and refiled it in\nour Court later that same day \u2013 one day too late.

We hold that denial\nwas reversible error, so vacate the sentence and remand to the\ndistrict court for resentencing.\n\n                      BACKGROUND\n\n     In December 2007, Abney pled guilty to unlawful\npossession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine\nbase, or crack, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1),\n(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2006). Abney was initially released on personal\nrecognizance pending sentencing. After Abney failed to\ncomply with terms of that release, the district court revoked\nAbney\u2019s bond and, on August 2, 2010, sentenced him to the\nthen-prevailing mandatory minimum: ten years\u2019 imprisonment\nand five years of supervised release. See id. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).\nOn an earlier appeal, this court ordered resentencing because\nAbney\u2019s counsel had been ineffective in failing to seek a\ncontinuance of the sentencing pending the anticipated\npresidential approval of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.\nL. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, already passed by both houses\nof Congress. See United States v. Abney, 812 F.3d 1079, 1082\n(D.C. Cir. 2016). That law would apply to sentences imposed\nafter it was signed into law, and its elimination of higher\nmandatory minimum sentences for crack offenses than for\nthose involving powder cocaine would have benefitted Abney.\nSee id. at 1084. On remand, under the new law with its five-\nyear mandatory minimum, the district court resentenced Abney\nto eight years in prison and five years of supervised release.\n\n    Abney was released from prison in 2016 but has twice\nbeen recommitted for failure to comply with terms of his\nsupervised release. Abney first violated supervised release\nwhen he was convicted of misdemeanor contempt for visiting\n\f                               3\nhis mother\u2019s home in violation of a D.C. Superior Court stay-\naway order. The district court revoked his supervised release\nin May 2017 and sentenced him to four months in prison with\na four-year term of supervised release. After serving the term\nof imprisonment for having violated terms of his prior release,\nAbney was released to a halfway house, but was discharged\nbefore completing his term of sentence there after he returned\nlate to the house on two occasions. He further violated\nconditions of release by failing to appear regularly for meetings\nwith his probation officer and for failing to reside at his\nmother\u2019s home, which, with his mother\u2019s agreement following\nresolution of the Superior Court case, had become his assigned\nresidence. See 11/8/19 Revocation Hearing Tr. (RH Tr.) at\n1:18-2:9, 5:6-8 (Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x (AA) 131-32, 135); 5/15/17\nRH Tr. at 7:5-7 (AA 124). On November 8, 2019, the district\ncourt again revoked Abney\u2019s supervised release. 11/8/19 RH\nTr. at 8:17-24 (AA 137). That revocation proceeding is the\nsubject of this appeal.\n\n     Abney\u2014who was removed as a child from his mother\u2019s\ncustody and raised in foster homes yet had graduated from high\nschool and begun college before his conviction at age 20\u2014got\na job after he came out of prison. Id. at 6:15-19, 7:25-8:3 (AA\n135-37).      At the revocation hearing, the government\nrecommended that Abney serve four months in prison, while\nAbney requested six months in a halfway house so that he\ncould keep working. Id. 6:3-8:6 (AA 135-37). Without first\ninviting Abney to address the court, the district court chose to\nexceed the government\u2019s recommendation, announcing that it\nwould revoke Abney\u2019s supervised release and impose a\nsentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment, two months in a\nhalfway house, and eighteen months of supervised release with\nmandated cognitive behavioral therapy. Id. at 8:9-24 (AA\n137). As the court was specifying the terms of the sentence,\nAbney interrupted, asking, \u201cMay I say something?\u201d Id. at 8:25\n\f                               4\n(AA 137). The district court replied, \u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d and\ncompleted the imposition of the sentence. Id. at 9:1-10:8 (AA\n138-39). After discussing with the probation officer some\ndetails regarding the halfway house assignment and available\nservices, and asking both counsel whether they had requests or\nquestions, the court asked, \u201cNow, Mr. Abney, do you want to\nsay something? What do you want to say?\u201d Id. at 10:14-15\n(AA 139).\n\n     Abney responded \u201cYes,\u201d and started to say that he thought\nhe had not violated the terms of his release, questioning\nwhether it was permissible for the probation officer to stop by\nhis house more than once a month. Id. at 10:16-25 (AA 139).\nThe district court interrupted, \u201cAre you done?\u201d Id. at 11:2 (AA\n140). Abney responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not done,\u201d and again\nprotested that he did not understand how the probation officer\ncould \u201cpop by my house any time she wants,\u201d resulting in his\nbeing found in violation for his unwillingness to meet with her,\nwhen the terms of his probation required only that he meet with\nher once a month. See id. at 11:3-7 (AA 140); see also id. at\n14:3-12 (AA 143).\n\n     The judge responded that Abney\u2019s failure to keep in touch\nwith the probation officer violated his terms of supervised\nrelease, and said he would hold a status conference to review\nfuture conditions of supervision when Abney was next\nreleased. Id. at 11:8-18 (AA 140). Abney persisted, saying\nthat he was \u201ctrying to get a new judge. I\u2019m trying to change\nmy probation [officer], and . . . going to jail is not helping my\nsituation. That\u2019s making my situation even worse. . . . I\u2019m\ntrying to get into a halfway house.\u201d Id. at 12:12-15, 13:1-2 (AA\n141-42). The court told Abney: \u201cYou\u2019re going to go to a\nhalfway house at some point, but not until you serve six\nmonths.\u201d Id. at 13:3-5 (AA 142). Abney further urged the\ncourt, \u201cI\u2019m homeless. . . . I cannot stay with my mother, so this\n\f                                5\nis not helping my situation. You keep sending me to jail. It\u2019s\nnot working. I got two jobs right now so why am I going to\njail? This is not helping my situation.\u201d Id. at 13:6-17 (AA\n142).\n\n     The court told Abney, \u201cYou can talk with your counsel,\u201d\nbut Abney objected, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you. You\u2019re doing it.\nYou\u2019re sending me to jail.\u201d Id. at 13:18-25 (AA 142). After\nthe court again instructed Abney to speak with his counsel,\ncounsel interjected that Abney was trying to express his\n\u201cfrustration\u201d that \u201c[l]iving on the streets and trying to maintain\nemployment and comply with all of the conditions of\nsupervised release is extremely difficult, and it sort of sets him\nup for failure,\u201d and that Abney \u201cwas asking for a lengthier time\nin the halfway house as opposed to incarceration . . . so that he\ncan get himself back on his feet.\u201d Id. at 14:15-25 (AA 143).\nThe court asked if Abney would like a longer term in the\nhalfway house following incarceration than the two months the\ncourt had imposed; Abney\u2019s counsel said he would not. See id.\nat 15:2-16 (AA 144). The court rejected the notion that the\nhalfway house should replace any of the six months of prison\ntime, commenting in an aside to Abney\u2019s counsel, \u201cI\u2019m\nsure . . . you have a very clear recollection as to . . . how\nsuccessful he was operating in the halfway house when he was\nin one. . . . He wasn\u2019t very successful.\u201d Id. at 15:17-19, 21 (AA\n144). The court told counsel to \u201c[p]lease answer to the best of\nyour ability any questions\u201d Abney has, and concluded the\nproceeding. Id. at 16:10-11 (AA 145).\n\n     On appeal, Abney asks for resentencing on the ground that\nthe district court denied his right to allocute before delivery of\nhis sentence. Abney also requests reassignment of the case to\na different judge for resentencing to preserve the reality and\nappearance of sentencing by an impartial court, because he\nbelieves the district judge will have difficulty setting aside his\n\f                               6\nprior judgment. The government does not dispute that the\ndistrict court erred in denying Abney\u2019s right to presentence\nallocution, but argues that Abney did not preserve his claim in\nthe district court, that the district court did not commit plain\nerror, and that, in any event, reassignment is unwarranted. For\nthe reasons set forth below, we grant Abney\u2019s request for\nresentencing but deny his request for reassignment.\n\n                        DISCUSSION\n\n     We must vacate the sentence the district court imposed\nwithout having first invited Abney to allocute, but there is more\nthan one available path to that result. The district court erred\nin failing to invite Abney to allocute before sentencing him.\nWhile the court was imposing the sentence, Abney asked to\nspeak. The judge stopped him and finished the sentencing\nbefore circling back and addressing himself to Abney. The\njudge responded to Abney\u2019s further questions by directing him\nto get any clarification from his own counsel. The defense did\nnot further take exception to the court\u2019s failure to invite Abney\nto allocute.\n\n     District courts have an established, affirmative obligation\nto invite defendants to allocute before they impose a\nsentence\u2014whether initially or upon violation of conditions of\nsupervised release. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii),\n32.1(b)(2)(E). Our circuit has had few opportunities to review\nallocution-denial claims, but the law of other circuits reveals a\nrange of approaches to review of such errors. Where courts fail\nto make the requisite invitation, some circuits require\nautomatic reversal, or review some unpreserved allocution\nclaims de novo. See, e.g., United States v. De Alba Pagan, 33\nF.3d 125, 130 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that, \u201cif the trial court\nfails to afford a defendant either the right of allocution\nconferred by Rule 32(a)(1)(C) or its functional equivalent,\n\f                                7\nvacation of the ensuing sentence must follow automatically\u201d);\nUnited States v. Richardson, 948 F.3d 733, 744 (6th Cir. 2020)\n(\u201c[W]e review an allegation of a complete denial of the right to\nallocute de novo[, b]ut when the appellant alleges an improper\nlimitation on his right to allocute\u2014but failed to object below\u2014\nwe review for plain error.\u201d) (citation omitted). Other circuits\nreview an unpreserved allocution-denial claim only for plain\nerror. See United States v. Bustamante-Conchas, 850 F.3d\n1130, 1133, 1138-39 (10th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (applying\nplain-error standard to allocution denial, reversing circuit\nprecedent that had treated such error as \u201cper se or\npresumptively prejudicial\u201d); United States v. Reyna, 358 F.3d\n344, 347, 350 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (applying plain-error\nstandard to allocution error, reversing prior \u201cconsistently held\u201d\ncircuit rule that \u201cdenial of the right of allocution is not subject\nto plain or harmless error review under Rule 52\u201d but instead\n\u201crequires automatic reversal\u201d); see generally United States v.\nVonn, 535 U.S. 55, 65 (2002) (holding Rule 52(b) plain-error\nreview applicable to district court\u2019s failure during plea\ncolloquy to fulfill affirmative obligation of Rule 11(b)(1)(D) to\ninform defendant of right to appointed trial counsel).\n\n      We have not weighed in on the review framework but,\nassuming the more demanding approach\u2014that reversal is in no\ncase \u201cautomatic\u201d and that preservation matters\u2014we conclude\nthat Abney\u2019s attempt to speak up preserved his claim and, even\nif it did not, the court\u2019s failure to invite Abney to allocute\nbefore it sentenced him is plain error calling for resentencing.\nOn this record, we believe that Abney\u2019s request to \u201csay\nsomething\u201d sufficed to preserve his objection. But whether we\nreview Abney\u2019s claim as preserved by his request to speak in\ndistrict court, or as raised for the first time on appeal, so\nscrutinized only for plain error, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b);\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-36 (1993), we\nconclude that vacatur and remand is required.\n\f                               8\n1. Abney Preserved His Claim\n\n     Considered in context, Abney\u2019s request to speak sufficed\nto preserve his allocution claim. Rule 51(b) provides that \u201c[a]\nparty may preserve a claim of error by informing the court . . .\nof [1] the action the party wishes the court to take, or [2] the\nparty\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s action and the grounds for that\nobjection.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(b). \u201cBy \u2018informing the court\u2019\nof the \u2018action\u2019 he \u2018wishes the court to take,\u2019 a party ordinarily\nbrings to the court\u2019s attention his objection to a contrary\ndecision.\u201d Holguin-Hernandez v. United States, 140 S. Ct.\n762, 766 (2020) (citation omitted); see also United States v.\nTate, 630 F.3d 194, 197 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (\u201c[C]laims of error\nare preserved when a party informs the district court of the\nrequested action, or of the objection and the grounds therefor.\u201d\n(citing United States v. Wilson, 605 F.3d 985, 1022 (D.C. Cir.\n2010))). Once a party has asked the court to take action the\nparty believes is legally required, further \u201cexceptions to the\ndistrict court\u2019s rulings or orders are unnecessary\u201d because the\n\u201cpoint of requiring objections to be made at the time of\nsentencing is to afford the district court the opportunity to\nconsider them, not to clutter the proceedings with needless\nobjections after the district court has ruled.\u201d Tate, 630 F.3d at\n197 (citing In re Sealed Case, 439 F.3d 685, 690 n.2 (D.C. Cir.\n2003)); see also United States v. Rashad, 396 F.3d 398, 401\n(D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\n     Abney preserved his claim under the first clause of Rule\n51(b), as interpreted in Holguin-Hernandez. The dynamics of\nsentencing support that result: After a defendant tries\nunsuccessfully to be heard at sentencing, it is unrealistic and\neven counterproductive to require him to \u201csay, in effect, \u2018now\nthat you have imposed sentence, let me share some mitigating\ncircumstances you may wish to consider in meting out my\npunishment.\u2019\u201d United States v. Barnes, 948 F.2d 325, 331 (7th\n\f                                9\nCir. 1991). Abney preserved his claim when he asked during\nsentencing for a chance to say something and the district court\ndenied his request. The defense was under no further\nobligation to state an objection after the sentencing was\ncomplete.\n\n     The Supreme Court in Holguin-Hernandez held that\ncounsel\u2019s request for a sentence shorter than the one the court\nultimately imposed preserved defendant\u2019s claim under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that the sentence was excessive. See 140\nS. Ct. at 766. The Court stressed that trial judges, \u201chaving in\nmind their \u2018overarching duty\u2019 under \u00a7 3553(a), would\nordinarily understand\u201d that such a defendant \u201cwas making the\nargument . . . that the shorter sentence would be \u2018sufficient\u2019 and\na longer sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve the\npurposes of sentencing\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a). Id. (quoting Pepper\nv. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 493 (2011)). Here, we deal with\ndenial of presentence allocution, a right to which it is likewise\nfair to assume district court judges during sentencing \u201chav[e]\nin mind.\u201d Indeed, many\u2014if not most\u2014trial judges, including\nthe judge in this case, see 8/2/10 Sentencing Hearing Tr. at\n10:23-24 (AA 37), have a standard script or template that they\nadapt or reference as a prompt during sentencing proceedings\nto ensure that they cover all the requisite points in each\nsentencing. A defendant\u2019s opportunity to allocute is\u2014or\nshould be\u2014a standard item on such a checklist. See\nBustamante-Conchas, 850 F.3d at 1133 (\u201cOf course, the best\npractice is for the district court in its trial manuals and other\nmemory prompts to always offer defendants the opportunity to\nallocute on their own behalf.\u201d). Indeed, the same judge that\nsentenced Abney in 2019 previously emphasized the court\u2019s\n\u201cpractice to hear from . . . the defendant himself if he wishes to\naddress the court,\u201d 8/2/10 Sentencing Hearing Tr. at 2:15-17\n(AA 29), and noted the defendant\u2019s \u201cright to address the court\u201d\nbefore the court \u201cwould decide\u201d his sentence, 4/9/13 Motion\n\f                               10\nHearing Tr. at 17:2-3 (AA 56). When the judge resentenced\nAbney in 2016 on remand from this court, Abney thanked the\ncourt for his opportunity to speak, to which the judge\nresponded, \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to it. You\u2019re absolutely entitled.\u201d\n5/20/16 Resentencing Hearing Tr. at 30:6-7 (AA 106). And,\nmost relevant here, the same judge asked if Abney wished to\nspeak before revocation of his supervised release and\nsentencing in 2017. 5/15/17 RH Tr. at 7:25-8:8 (AA 124-25).\n\n     At the 2019 hearing, however, the court began to impose\nthe sentence without inviting allocution. Abney interrupted,\n\u201cMay I say something?\u201d 11/8/19 RH Tr. at 8:25 (AA 137).\nGiven the context and timing of his request, it was evident\nAbney was invoking his right to \u201cmake a statement\u201d on his own\nbehalf prior to sentencing. Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(b)(2)(E)\n(requiring that every defendant be given \u201can opportunity to\nmake a statement and present any information in mitigation\u201d).\nThat request to \u201csay something\u201d as the district court began to\ndeliver sentence sufficed to \u201cbring[] to the court\u2019s attention\u201d\nhis entitlement to presentence allocution, thereby preserving\nhis claim. Holguin-Hernandez, 140 S. Ct. at 766. And, just as\nthe claim in Holguin-Hernandez was not forfeited where the\njudge \u201casked counsel if there was \u2018[a]nything further,\u2019\u201d in\nresponse to which \u201cCounsel said that there was not,\u201d id. at 765,\nAbney\u2019s counsel did not forfeit his allocution claim by\nresponding to the district court\u2019s general query for \u201c[a]ny other\nrequests\u201d by saying, \u201cNo other requests,\u201d 11/8/19 RH Tr.\nat 10:9-10 (AA 139). We do not require defendants or their\ncounsel to invoke magic words or talismanic language, or to\nreassert in the form of an exception to the court\u2019s decision a\nclaim already preserved when the party asked the court for the\ndesired judicial action. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(a). A party\u2019s\nrequest for the desired action that reasonably apprises the\ndistrict court of the error and gives the court an opportunity to\ncorrect it is alone enough. See Tate, 630 F.3d at 197-98. Once\n\f                              11\nAbney asked to speak at sentencing, his claim was preserved\nwithout further need to make exception after the district court\nruled.\n\n     In applying Holguin-Hernandez, we acknowledge\ndistinctions between that case and this one. The Court there\nheld that a simple request for a shorter sentence preserved for\nappeal the claim that the sentence was excessive in violation of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but noted that it was not thereby deciding\n\u201cwhat is sufficient to preserve a claim that a trial court used\nimproper procedures in arriving at its chosen sentence.\u201d\nHolguin-Hernandez, 140 S. Ct. at 767; accord id. (Alito, J.,\nconcurring). The Court\u2019s caveat was evidently sparked by the\nconcern that a general request for a lower sentence might not\nsuffice, for example, to bring to a sentencing court\u2019s attention\nprocedural errors in Sentencing Guidelines calculations. Only\nfour years earlier, the Court in Molina-Martinez v. United\nStates observed that \u201c[t]he Guidelines are complex, and so\nthere will be instances when a district court\u2019s sentencing of a\ndefendant within the framework of an incorrect Guidelines\nrange goes unnoticed,\u201d and held that the defendant, who had\n\u201cfailed to object to the miscalculation,\u201d was entitled to\nappellate review only for plain error. 136 S. Ct. 1338, 1342-43\n(2016); see also Rosales-Mireles v. United States, 138 S. Ct.\n1897, 1904 (2018) (\u201cGiven the complexity of the calculation\n[of Sentencing Guidelines ranges], district courts sometimes\nmake mistakes. It is unsurprising, then, that \u2018there will be\ninstances when a district court\u2019s sentencing of a defendant\nwithin the framework of an incorrect Guidelines range goes\nunnoticed\u2019 by the parties as well, which may result in a\ndefendant raising the error for the first time on appeal.\u201d\n(quoting Molina-Martinez, 136 S. Ct. at 1343)).\n\n    This case involves a claim of procedural error, but because\nthe procedural right involved is a requisite of any sentencing\n\f                               12\nand its omission is easy to detect, we treat it as akin to the\nstraightforward claim of excessive sentence in Holguin-\nHernandez and unlike the buried flaws in Sentencing-\nGuidelines calculations described in Molina-Martinez and\nRosales-Mireles that may call for more specific and detailed\nobjections to be effectively preserved under the first clause of\nRule 51(b). District courts have a clear, well-established,\naffirmative obligation to invite defendants to exercise their\nright to speak on their own behalf before sentencing. See Fed.\nR. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii), 32.1(b)(2)(E). Against that\nbackdrop, it is difficult to envision a request by a defendant to\nbe heard at sentencing that would not suffice under Rule 51(b)\nto \u201cinform[]the court\u201d of the nature of the claim. There was no\nmore need here for Abney to specify that he sought to\n\u201callocute\u201d than there was for Gonzalo Holguin-Hernandez to\nspecify that he sought a sentence that was no \u201cgreater than\nnecessary\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), or to specify that he\ntook exception to the sentence the court imposed as\n\u201cunreasonable.\u201d Holguin-Hernandez, 140 S. Ct. at 766. In the\ncontext of a revocation hearing, it would be apparent to a court\nthat, when Abney asked, \u201cMay I say something?\u201d he was\ninvoking his right under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(E) to speak on his\nown behalf before being sentenced.\n\n     We accordingly review Abney\u2019s claim of error de novo.\nBut because this is our court\u2019s first application of Holguin-\nHernandez, and the error here is sufficiently clear, we will also\nexplain below why analysis of the claim as unpreserved would\nalso require vacatur and remand.\n\n2. The District Court Erred in Denying Abney\u2019s Right to\n   Allocute\n\n    A defendant has a right, codified in the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure, to address the sentencing judge before\n\f                               13\nimposition of a sentence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii).\n\u201c[T]rial judges should leave no room for doubt that the\ndefendant has been issued a personal invitation to speak prior\nto sentencing.\u201d Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 305\n(1961) (plurality opinion) (Frankfurter, J). The allocution right\nis deeply rooted in our legal tradition. See Couch v. United\nStates, 235 F.2d 519, 523 (D.C. Cir. 1956) (en banc). \u201cAs early\nas 1689, it was recognized that the court\u2019s failure to ask the\ndefendant if he had anything to say before sentence was\nimposed required reversal.\u2019\u2019 Green, 365 U.S. at 304. The\nsimple procedural step serves several interrelated purposes,\nincluding eliciting information relevant to mitigation or mercy,\ndemonstrating to the public that the courts treat criminal\ndefendants in an individualized, fair, and openminded manner,\nand simply acknowledging the defendant\u2019s humanity. See\nBustamante-Conchas, 850 F.3d at 1136-37; United States v.\nDaniels, 760 F.3d 920, 924, 926 (9th Cir. 2014); De Alba\nPagan, 33 F.3d at 129; Barnes, 948 F.2d at 328; see also\ngenerally Kimberly A. Thomas, Beyond Mitigation: Towards\na Theory of Allocution, 75 Fordham L. Rev. 2641, 2666-74\n(2007) (arguing that allocution is important not only for\npotential mitigation, but also for humanizing the defendant);\nJonathan D. Casper, Tom R. Tyler, and Bonnie Fisher,\nProcedural Justice in Felony Cases, 22 Law & Soc\u2019y Rev. 483,\n487-88 (1988) (summarizing studies that indicate \u201clitigants\nwho receive unfavorable outcomes but perceive that they have\nbeen able to express their views fully and to have them\nconsidered may be more satisfied with the overall experience\nthan those who receive more favorable outcomes yet perceive\nthat they have had less opportunity to have their view expressed\nand considered\u201d). The intervening years since the Supreme\nCourt decided Green have brought profound transformations in\ncriminal procedure, but \u201c[n]one of these modern innovations\nlessens the need for the defendant, personally, to have the\nopportunity to present to the court his plea in mitigation,\u201d for\n\f                                14\nthe \u201cmost persuasive counsel may not be able to speak for a\ndefendant as the defendant might, with halting eloquence,\nspeak for himself.\u201d 365 U.S. at 304.\n\n     The right of presentence allocution applies to sentences\nimposed for revocation of supervised release just as it does to\ninitial sentencing. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) and\n32.1(b)(2)(E); Daniels, 760 F.3d at 924; United States v.\nGonzalez, 529 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir. 2008); United States v.\nCarruth, 528 F.3d 845, 846-47 (11th Cir. 2008); United States\nv. Pitre, 504 F.3d 657, 661-62 (7th Cir. 2007). Rule 32\nexplicitly requires allocution \u201c[b]efore imposing sentence\u201d in\nan original sentencing proceeding, Fed. R. Crim. P.\n32(i)(4)(A)(ii), whereas Rule 32.1 provides in more summary\nfashion that a person facing revocation of supervised release\n\u201cis entitled to\u201d an \u201copportunity to make a statement and present\nany information in mitigation,\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(b)(2)(E).\n\n     The government suggests that, because \u201cRule\n32.1(b)(2)(E) does not specify when the opportunity to speak\nand provide mitigating information must occur,\u201d and \u201cthe court\nultimately did invite appellant to speak,\u201d it is not entirely clear\nwhether the district court erred in failing to invite the defendant\nto speak \u201cbefore the district court announces its intended\nsentence.\u201d Appellee Br. 15-16 (emphasis added). We are\nunpersuaded. Despite the rules\u2019 wording differences, we hold\nthat the same allocution right applies whether the context is\ninitial or revocation sentencing. The timing of the opportunity\nto allocute\u2014before the sentence is imposed\u2014is widely and\nappropriately recognized as essential both to the reality and\npublic perception that the judge will fairly consider it before\ndeciding on the sentence. The government identifies no\npersuasive reason why the Rules\u2019 drafters would have tacitly\nintended that the allocution \u201copportunity\u201d to which the\ndefendant is \u201centitled\u201d at revocation, per Rule 32.1, differ in\n\f                               15\nthat key respect from the opportunity described in Rule 32. The\nAdvisory Committee Notes to the 2005 Amendments\naddressed a circuit split over whether the Rule 32 allocution\nrequirements should be incorporated into Rule 32.1, explaining\nthat \u201c[t]he amended rule recognizes the importance of\nallocution and now explicitly recognizes that right at Rule\n32.1(b)(2) revocation hearings, and extends it as well to Rule\n32.1(c)(1) modification hearings where the court may decide to\nmodify the terms or conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation. In\neach instance the court is required to give the defendant the\nopportunity to make a statement and present any mitigating\ninformation.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 advisory committee\u2019s note\n(2005 amend.). The differing syntax of the two rules reflects\nthat the primary statement of the right appears in Rule 32, with\nRule 32.1 confirming its applicability at revocation or\nmodification sentencing. If allocution is to serve its purposes,\nthe opportunity to allocute must in either context precede the\nsentencing decision.\n\n     The government contends that \u201c[i]t is not clear that\n\u2018statement\u2019 and \u2018information in mitigation\u2019\u201d as used in Rule\n32.1 \u201ceven refer to sentencing.\u201d Appellee Br. at 14. Because\nthe subsection is titled \u201cRevocation Hearing,\u201d the government\nspeculates that \u201cthe text of Rule 32.1(b)(2)(E) could reasonably\nbe read as referring not to a right of sentencing allocution but\ninstead to a defendant\u2019s right to present mitigating evidence to\nconvince the court that any violation does not warrant\nrevocation.\u201d Id. Abney responds that \u201c[i]t is not clear what the\ngovernment means by this; when a court revokes a defendant\u2019s\nsupervised release, it is sentencing him,\u201d so Rule 32.1\n\u201cguaranteed Mr. Abney the right to allocute before the court\nrevoked his release and replaced it with prison.\u201d Reply Br. at\n7. We agree with Abney. Indeed, the government\u2019s argument\nwould appear to cut the other way: If we were to read Rule\n32.1 to address only whether or not to revoke in the first place,\n\f                                16\nrevocation resentencing would have to proceed under Rule 32,\nwhich is not by its terms limited to initial sentencing but applies\ngenerally to \u201cSentencing and Judgment.\u201d Whether under Rule\n32 or Rule 32.1, a court sentencing a defendant to confinement\nupon revocation of supervised release must offer the defendant\na presentence opportunity to allocute.\n\n     There is no dispute that the district court did not invite\nAbney to speak before it sentenced him to prison. The\ngovernment suggests that the court cured the error by allowing\nAbney to speak afterwards. Perhaps a belated opportunity to\nallocute could be effective if, for example, the court openly\nacknowledged its lapse during the sentencing proceeding,\nexplained that it would treat its announced sentence as\nprovisional only, reopened the proceeding and invited the\ndefendant to speak with assurances that it would give full\nconsideration to the defendant\u2019s statements, and then stated\nreasons for its sentence that accounted for what the defendant\nsaid. See generally United States v. Margiotti, 85 F.3d 100,\n103 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding error cured); but see Gonzalez, 529\nF.3d at 97-98 (holding error uncured); United States v. Luepke,\n495 F.3d 443, 450 (7th Cir. 2007) (same); Barnes, 948 F.2d at\n331 (same). An on-the-spot remedy for denial of presentence\nallocution is certainly preferable to vacatur and remand. But\nfor a correction to be effective, the district court must make\nunmistakably clear that it has set aside the announced sentence\nand heard from the defendant with an open mind. After all,\n\u201cneither a defendant nor observers in the courtroom are likely\nto believe that an opportunity to try to talk a judge out of a\nsentence already imposed is as effective as an opportunity to\nspeak before a sentence has been imposed.\u201d Gonzalez, 529\nF.3d at 98.\n\n     Assuming a court may in some circumstances correct its\nerror by promptly recognizing its lapse and, in effect,\n\f                               17\nrewinding the proceeding, that is not what happened in this\ncase. While the district court eventually permitted Abney to\nspeak, it did not acknowledge its error in failing to do so\npresentence. The court did not set aside its previous sentence\nor announce that it would treat it as only a proposal until it had\nheard from Abney. Once Abney spoke, asking for placement\nin a halfway house rather than prison to support his\nrehabilitation and allow him to continue to work, and offering\nmitigating circumstances for his violation of supervised\nrelease, the court did not consider how Abney\u2019s statement\nmight bear on the sentence. Rather, the court treated its\nexchange with Abney as a chance for Abney to ask questions\nand obtain information about a fait accompli\u2014information that\nthe court by and large told Abney he should seek from his\ncounsel. 11/8/19 RH Tr. at 13:18-23 (AA 142) (\u201cCOURT: You\ncan talk with your counsel. DEFENDANT: I\u2019m talking to you.\nYou\u2019re doing it. You\u2019re sending me to jail.\u201d); id. at 16:10-11\n(AA 145). The closest the court came to engaging with\nAbney\u2019s arguments was in an aside directed to Abney\u2019s\ncounsel, commenting \u201cI\u2019m sure . . . you have a very clear\nrecollection as to . . . how successful he was\u201d in his previous\nhalfway house placement. Id. at 15:17-19 (AA 144).\n\n3. The Error Requires Vacatur Even If Unpreserved\n\n     Even if Abney\u2019s request to be heard at sentencing were not\nsufficiently clear to count under Rule 51(b) as \u201cinforming the\ncourt\u201d of the error, the district court\u2019s error warrants vacatur\nfor resentencing. For an unpreserved error to count as \u201cplain\nerror\u201d under Rule 52(b), the error must be clear, affect\nsubstantial rights, and impair the fairness, integrity, or public\nreputation of judicial proceedings. Olano, 507 U.S. at 734-36.\n\n   The error here is clear. Although neither the Supreme\nCourt nor this one has had prior occasion to apply Rule\n\f                               18\n32.1(b)(2)(E), \u201c[e]ven absent binding case law . . . an error can\nbe plain if it violates an \u2018absolutely clear\u2019 legal norm, \u2018for\nexample, because of the clarity of a statutory provision.\u2019\u201d In re\nSealed Case, 573 F.3d 844, 851 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting\nUnited States v. Merlos, 8 F.3d 48, 51 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). As\nalready discussed, the right to presentence allocution has deep\nroots in our jurisprudence, and there is no serious argument that\nit does not apply to the imposition of a sentence upon\nrevocation of supervised release just as it does to initial\nsentencing. The rule is straightforward. Every court to have\ndecided the issue has held that Rule 32.1 guarantees\ndefendants\u2019 right to allocute before sentence. The government\nhas identified no case from any circuit\u2014nor have we\u2014that\napplied plain-error review and determined that an uncorrected\nfailure to invite a defendant to allocute before imposing a\nsentence was not clear error under the first step of Olano.\n\n     To show prejudice on plain-error review, a defendant\nordinarily must identify \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the\nsentencing court\u2019s obvious errors affected his sentence.\u201d In re\nSealed Case, 573 F.3d 844, 852 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 734). We assume without deciding that we\nrequire a case-specific showing of prejudice in allocution\ncases. But see, e.g., Olano, 507 U.S. at 735 (noting that certain\nerrors may be presumed prejudicial); Luepke, 495 F.3d at 451\n(presuming prejudice because it \u201cwould be almost impossible\nto determine whether . . . a defendant\u2019s statement, that was\nnever made, would have altered the conclusions of the\nsentencing court\u201d); see also Bustamante-Conchas, 850 F.3d at\n1138-39 (surveying circuit law presuming allocution errors are\nprejudicial, and adopting a \u201cmore precise\u201d rule that \u201ca\ndefendant who shows he has been denied the right to allocute\nhas met his burden of demonstrating prejudice absent some\nextraordinary circumstance\u201d). The potential effect of a denial\nof allocution is not easily reduced to argument among lawyers,\n\f                               19\nfurther vexing the unavoidably counterfactual task of\nestablishing prejudice from an omission. At most, the\n\u201csomewhat lighter\u201d prejudice requirement that we apply in the\ncontext of sentencing error, United States v. Anderson, 632\nF.3d 1264, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 2011), applies to an allocution\nclaim. Some courts conclude that allocution errors can be\nnonprejudicial only if the defendant received the lowest\npossible sentence. See, e.g., Bustamante-Conchas, 850 F.3d at\n1140; Daniels, 760 F.3d at 925; Carruth, 528 F.3d 847 n.4.\nNeedless to say, that is not the case here, where the court had\nfull discretion and sentenced Abney more harshly than even the\ngovernment requested. Had the court asked Abney to speak\nand given due consideration to his statement before it decided\nupon the sentence, we believe there is a reasonable likelihood\nthe sentence would have been more forbearing and better\ntailored to Abney\u2019s circumstances. The error here accordingly\nwas prejudicial.\n\n     Finally, with the elements of plain error satisfied here, we\nalso conclude that we should exercise our discretion to correct\nthe error. Plain error calls for correction where it would\notherwise \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Olano, 507 U.S. at 736.\n\n    Imposing a criminal sentence is among the gravest powers\na government exercises over its people, and a defendant\u2019s\npresentence allocution to the court is a significant human\nencounter. The defendant\u2019s right to speak, and the court\u2019s\ncorresponding \u201cduty to listen and give careful and serious\nconsideration\u201d to what the defendant says, Daniels, 760 F.3d at\n926 (quoting United States v. Mack, 200 F.3d 653, 658 (9th Cir.\n2000)), provide essential recognition of the seriousness of the\nevent for the sentenced individual, and for the broader\ncommunity in whose name the sentence is imposed. A\n\f                                20\ndefendant, speaking personally to the court and the public, may\nevoke mercy.\n\n     Even where the judge\u2019s sentence remains unaffected,\nensuring the defendant\u2019s right to make a statement bolsters the\nintegrity of the judicial process by having the judge listen to\nand thereby openly recognize the defendant as a fellow human\nbeing whose liberty is at stake. Allocution disrupts the reality\nor appearance of \u201cassembly-line justice,\u201d Barnes, 948 F.2d at\n331, and thus its denial is no less threatening to the integrity of\nour judicial system\u2014and, indeed, perhaps more so\u2014when the\nsentence appears to be a foregone conclusion. Abney\u2019s brief\npoints to hearing transcripts and contends they show that \u201cthe\ndistrict judge displayed certainty about the sentence he\nimposed\u2014and no openness to being influenced by what Mr.\nAbney had to say.\u201d Appellant Br. 12. Our own review of those\ntranscripts shows that Abney\u2019s inability to be heard and make\nhis circumstances understood by the person \u201csending me to\njail\u201d evidently amplified his frustration with a process and\nsentence that he perceived \u201c[was] not helping my situation.\u201d\n11/8/19 RH Tr. at 13:20 (AA 142); id. at 12:14 (AA 141). We\nneed not credit counsel\u2019s characterization or the bases of\nAbney\u2019s frustration to view them as some evidence of risk to\nthe parties\u2019 and the public\u2019s perception of the court as\nopenminded and fair.\n\n     In the ordinary course of criminal proceedings, defendants\nthemselves typically remain silent. The prevalence of plea\nbargaining and, when cases do go to trial, the reality that few\ncriminal defendants testify, mean that the judge and the public\nrarely hear directly from the person being prosecuted. We do\nnot question those constraints in underscoring the importance\nof allocution as a chance for the defendant\u2019s own voice and\nperspective to be heard. In the words of one judge with decades\nof sentencing experience, \u201c[p]ermitting a defendant to speak\n\f                               21\nreaffirms human dignity in the face of severe punishment.\u201d D.\nBrock Hornby, Speaking in Sentences, 14 Green Bag 2D 147,\n154 (2011). Given the importance of the allocution right, there\nmay be few, if any, cases in which its unremedied denial would\nnot undermine the fairness of the judicial process. The\nintegrity of the process afforded this defendant requires vacatur\nand remand here.\n\n4. Abney\u2019s Request for Reassignment\n\n     We deny Abney\u2019s request to reassign the case to a different\njudge for resentencing. Abney seeks remand to a different\ndistrict judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, which gives us the\npower to direct reassignment on remand \u201cas may be just under\nthe circumstances.\u201d See Liteky v. U.S., 510 U.S. 540, 554\n(1994). Reassignment is a remedy reserved for \u201cthe unusual\ncase.\u201d United States v. Wolff, 127 F.3d 84, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\nThis case is assigned to an experienced district judge. He has\npreviously recognized that Abney is \u201cabsolutely entitled\u201d to an\nopportunity to allocute. See p. 10, supra. We expect that the\njudge will be able to \u201cput[] out of his [] mind [his] previously-\nexpressed views\u201d about the appropriate sentence, approach\nAbney with a clean slate and an open mind, invite him to speak\nbefore imposing the sentence, and take his statements into\naccount in resentencing him.

We hold that denial\nwas reversible error, so vacate the sentence and remand to the\ndistrict court for resentencing.\n\n                      BACKGROUND\n\n     In December 2007, Abney pled guilty to unlawful\npossession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine\nbase, or crack, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1),\n(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2006). Abney was initially released on personal\nrecognizance pending sentencing. After Abney failed to\ncomply with terms of that release, the district court revoked\nAbney\u2019s bond and, on August 2, 2010, sentenced him to the\nthen-prevailing mandatory minimum: ten years\u2019 imprisonment\nand five years of supervised release. See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">On an earlier appeal, this court ordered resentencing because\nAbney\u2019s counsel had been ineffective in failing to seek a\ncontinuance of the sentencing pending the anticipated\npresidential approval of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.\nL. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, already passed by both houses\nof Congress. See United States v.

That law would apply to sentences imposed\nafter it was signed into law, and its elimination of higher\nmandatory minimum sentences for crack offenses than for\nthose involving powder cocaine would have benefitted Abney.\nSee</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1084. </span><pre class=\"inline\">On remand, under the new law with its five-\nyear mandatory minimum, the district court resentenced Abney\nto eight years in prison and five years of supervised release.\n\n    Abney was released from prison in 2016 but has twice\nbeen recommitted for failure to comply with terms of his\nsupervised release. Abney first violated supervised release\nwhen he was convicted of misdemeanor contempt for visiting\n\f                               3\nhis mother\u2019s home in violation of a D.C. Superior Court stay-\naway order. The district court revoked his supervised release\nin May 2017 and sentenced him to four months in prison with\na four-year term of supervised release. After serving the term\nof imprisonment for having violated terms of his prior release,\nAbney was released to a halfway house, but was discharged\nbefore completing his term of sentence there after he returned\nlate to the house on two occasions. He further violated\nconditions of release by failing to appear regularly for meetings\nwith his probation officer and for failing to reside at his\nmother\u2019s home, which, with his mother\u2019s agreement following\nresolution of the Superior Court case, had become his assigned\nresidence. See 11/8/19 Revocation Hearing Tr. (RH Tr.) at\n1:18-2:9, 5:6-8 (Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x (AA) 131-32, 135); 5/15/17\nRH Tr. at 7:5-7 (AA 124). On November 8, 2019, the district\ncourt again revoked Abney\u2019s supervised release. 11/8/19 RH\nTr. at 8:17-24 (AA 137). That revocation proceeding is the\nsubject of this appeal.\n\n     Abney\u2014who was removed as a child from his mother\u2019s\ncustody and raised in foster homes yet had graduated from high\nschool and begun college before his conviction at age 20\u2014got\na job after he came out of prison.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 6:15-19, </span><pre class=\"inline\">7:25-8:3 (AA\n135-37).

Without first\ninviting Abney to address the court, the district court chose to\nexceed the government\u2019s recommendation, announcing that it\nwould revoke Abney\u2019s supervised release and impose a\nsentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment, two months in a\nhalfway house, and eighteen months of supervised release with\nmandated cognitive behavioral therapy.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 8:9-24 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(AA\n137). As the court was specifying the terms of the sentence,\nAbney interrupted, asking, \u201cMay I say something?\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 8:25\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\f                               4\n(AA 137).

After discussing with the probation officer some\ndetails regarding the halfway house assignment and available\nservices, and asking both counsel whether they had requests or\nquestions, the court asked, \u201cNow, Mr. Abney, do you want to\nsay something? What do you want to say?\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 10:14-15\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">(AA 139).\n\n     Abney responded \u201cYes,\u201d and started to say that he thought\nhe had not violated the terms of his release, questioning\nwhether it was permissible for the probation officer to stop by\nhis house more than once a month.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 10:16-25 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(AA 139).\nThe district court interrupted, \u201cAre you done?\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 11:2 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(AA\n140). Abney responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not done,\u201d and again\nprotested that he did not understand how the probation officer\ncould \u201cpop by my house any time she wants,\u201d resulting in his\nbeing found in violation for his unwillingness to meet with her,\nwhen the terms of his probation required only that he meet with\nher once a month.

Abney also requests reassignment of the case to\na different judge for resentencing to preserve the reality and\nappearance of sentencing by an impartial court, because he\nbelieves the district judge will have difficulty setting aside his\n\f                               6\nprior judgment. The government does not dispute that the\ndistrict court erred in denying Abney\u2019s right to presentence\nallocution, but argues that Abney did not preserve his claim in\nthe district court, that the district court did not commit plain\nerror, and that, in any event, reassignment is unwarranted. For\nthe reasons set forth below, we grant Abney\u2019s request for\nresentencing but deny his request for reassignment.\n\n                        DISCUSSION\n\n     We must vacate the sentence the district court imposed\nwithout having first invited Abney to allocute, but there is more\nthan one available path to that result. The district court erred\nin failing to invite Abney to allocute before sentencing him.\nWhile the court was imposing the sentence, Abney asked to\nspeak. The judge stopped him and finished the sentencing\nbefore circling back and addressing himself to Abney. The\njudge responded to Abney\u2019s further questions by directing him\nto get any clarification from his own counsel. The defense did\nnot further take exception to the court\u2019s failure to invite Abney\nto allocute.\n\n     District courts have an established, affirmative obligation\nto invite defendants to allocute before they impose a\nsentence\u2014whether initially or upon violation of conditions of\nsupervised release. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii),\n32.1(b)(2)(E). Our circuit has had few opportunities to review\nallocution-denial claims, but the law of other circuits reveals a\nrange of approaches to review of such errors. Where courts fail\nto make the requisite invitation, some circuits require\nautomatic reversal, or review some unpreserved allocution\nclaims de novo. See, e.g., United States v.

The timing of the opportunity\nto allocute\u2014before the sentence is imposed\u2014is widely and\nappropriately recognized as essential both to the reality and\npublic perception that the judge will fairly consider it before\ndeciding on the sentence. The government identifies no\npersuasive reason why the Rules\u2019 drafters would have tacitly\nintended that the allocution \u201copportunity\u201d to which the\ndefendant is \u201centitled\u201d at revocation, per Rule 32.1, differ in\n\f                               15\nthat key respect from the opportunity described in Rule 32. The\nAdvisory Committee Notes to the 2005 Amendments\naddressed a circuit split over whether the Rule 32 allocution\nrequirements should be incorporated into Rule 32.1, explaining\nthat \u201c[t]he amended rule recognizes the importance of\nallocution and now explicitly recognizes that right at Rule\n32.1(b)(2) revocation hearings, and extends it as well to Rule\n32.1(c)(1) modification hearings where the court may decide to\nmodify the terms or conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation. In\neach instance the court is required to give the defendant the\nopportunity to make a statement and present any mitigating\ninformation.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 advisory committee\u2019s note\n(2005 amend.). The differing syntax of the two rules reflects\nthat the primary statement of the right appears in Rule 32, with\nRule 32.1 confirming its applicability at revocation or\nmodification sentencing. If allocution is to serve its purposes,\nthe opportunity to allocute must in either context precede the\nsentencing decision.\n\n     The government contends that \u201c[i]t is not clear that\n\u2018statement\u2019 and \u2018information in mitigation\u2019\u201d as used in Rule\n32.1 \u201ceven refer to sentencing.\u201d Appellee Br. at 14. Because\nthe subsection is titled \u201cRevocation Hearing,\u201d the government\nspeculates that \u201cthe text of Rule 32.1(b)(2)(E) could reasonably\nbe read as referring not to a right of sentencing allocution but\ninstead to a defendant\u2019s right to present mitigating evidence to\nconvince the court that any violation does not warrant\nrevocation.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1428023\"> <a href=\"/opinion/1428023/united-states-v-pitre/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Abney responds </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">that \u201c[i]t is not clear what the\ngovernment means by this; when a court revokes a defendant\u2019s\nsupervised release, it is sentencing him,\u201d so Rule 32.1\n\u201cguaranteed Mr. Abney the right to allocute before the court\nrevoked his release and replaced it with prison.\u201d Reply Br. at\n7. We agree with Abney. Indeed, the government\u2019s argument\nwould appear to cut the other way: If we were to read Rule\n32.1 to address only whether or not to revoke in the first place,\n\f                                16\nrevocation resentencing would have to proceed under Rule 32,\nwhich is not by its terms limited to initial sentencing but applies\ngenerally to \u201cSentencing and Judgment.\u201d Whether under Rule\n32 or Rule 32.1, a court sentencing a defendant to confinement\nupon revocation of supervised release must offer the defendant\na presentence opportunity to allocute.\n\n     There is no dispute that the district court did not invite\nAbney to speak before it sentenced him to prison. The\ngovernment suggests that the court cured the error by allowing\nAbney to speak afterwards. Perhaps a belated opportunity to\nallocute could be effective if, for example, the court openly\nacknowledged its lapse during the sentencing proceeding,\nexplained that it would treat its announced sentence as\nprovisional only, reopened the proceeding and invited the\ndefendant to speak with assurances that it would give full\nconsideration to the defendant\u2019s statements, and then stated\nreasons for its sentence that accounted for what the defendant\nsaid.

The records related to the EPA\u2019s purported adoption\nof a \u201cnonacquiescence decision\u201d\u2014that is, a determination to\nnot follow a specific court of appeals\u2019 judgment in cases arising\noutside of that circuit. The judgment at issue is that of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Iowa\nLeague of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844 (8th Cir. 2013).\n\n     On November 19, 2013, the EPA issued a press statement\nadvising the public that (i) Iowa League of Cities was legally\nbinding within the Eighth Circuit, and (ii) outside of that\ncircuit, the EPA would continue to apply the regulatory\ninterpretations vacated by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment. The\nEPA does not contest on appeal that this position amounted to\na nonacquiescence decision.\n\n     The central dispute in this appeal is one of timing. Did the\nEPA settle on its nonacquiescence position at the time of that\npress statement on November 19, 2013, or in the days leading\nup to it? Or even earlier? The answer to the timing question\nwill determine whether documents regarding that\nnonacquiescence decision\u2014all but one of which were created\nbetween November 14, 2013 and November 18, 2013\u2014are\npredecisional and, as such, may qualify for withholding under\nthe EPA\u2019s deliberative process privilege.\n\n    Because the date on which the EPA reached a final\ndecision to not acquiesce remains a genuine issue of disputed\nmaterial fact, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary\n\f                               3\njudgment in favor of the EPA and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n    Congress enacted FOIA \u201cto pierce the veil of\nadministrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of\npublic scrutiny.\u201d Bartko v. Department of Justice, 898 F.3d 51,\n61 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting Citizens for Responsibility &\nEthics in Washington v. Department of Justice, 746 F.3d 1082,\n1088 (D.C. Cir. 2014)). By empowering individuals to obtain\ncopies of agency records just by the asking, FOIA protects the\nbasic right of the public \u201cto be informed about what their\ngovernment is up to.\u201d Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of\nScience & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 150 (D.C. Cir. 2016)\n(quoting Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for\nFreedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989)).\n\n     That said, FOIA does not pursue transparency at all costs.\nSee Bartko, 898 F.3d at 61\u201362. Congress recognized that\n\u201clegitimate governmental and private interests could be harmed\nby release of certain types of information,\u201d and so attempted to\n\u201cbalance the public\u2019s need for access to official information\nwith the Government\u2019s [legitimate] need for confidentiality.\u201d\nAquAlliance v. United States Bureau of Reclamation, 856 F.3d\n101, 102\u2013103 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (formatting modified). To that\nend, Congress exempted nine categories of records from\nFOIA\u2019s general requirement of disclosure. See 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 552(b)(1)\u2013(9). But even when an exemption applies, the\nagency must disclose \u201c[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of\na record,\u201d the \u201camount of information deleted, and the\nexemption under which the deletion is made.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(b).\n\f                               4\n    This case involves Exemption 5, which allows agencies to\nwithhold from disclosure records that are\n\n       inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or\n       letters that would not be available by law to a\n       party other than an agency in litigation with the\n       agency, provided that the deliberative process\n       privilege shall not apply to records created 25\n       years or more before the date on which the\n       records were requested[.]\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5).\n\n     Under Exemption 5, agencies generally can withhold\nmaterials \u201cnormally privileged in the civil discovery context.\u201d\nNLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 149 (1975).\nThat includes materials that fall under an agency\u2019s deliberative\nprocess or attorney-client privilege. See Coastal States Gas\nCorp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 862 (D.C. Cir.\n1980).      The deliberative process privilege \u201cprotects\ngovernment documents that are both [i] predecisional and [ii]\ndeliberative\u201d in nature. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Department of\nDefense, 847 F.3d 735, 739 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (formatting\nmodified).      In that way, the privilege \u201creflects the\ncommonsense notion that agencies craft better rules when their\nemployees can spell out in writing the pitfalls as well as\nstrengths of policy options, coupled with the understanding that\nemployees would be chilled from such rigorous deliberation if\nthey feared it might become public.\u201d Id.\n\n                               B\n\n     Hall submitted a FOIA request to the EPA on November\n13, 2014. The request sought certain records pertaining to the\nEPA\u2019s purported decision to not follow outside of the Eighth\n\f                                  5\nCircuit that court\u2019s judgment in Iowa League of Cities v. EPA,\n711 F.3d 844 (8th Cir. 2013).\n\n    In Iowa League of Cities, the Eighth Circuit vacated two\nEPA rules regulating water treatment processes at municipally\nowned sewer systems. See Iowa League of Cities, 711 F.3d at\n854, 878.\n\n     By October 8, 2013, the EPA had forgone legal avenues to\nchallenge that decision. The EPA\u2019s petition for rehearing en\nbanc was denied on July 10, 2013. Iowa League of Cities v.\nEPA, No. 11-3412, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 14034 (8th Cir. July\n10, 2013). The deadline for filing a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari was October 8, 2013. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c); see\nalso SUP. CT. R. 13. No petition was ever filed. 1 Instead,\n\u201c[b]eginning in 2013, EPA made statements indicating that it\nwould not acquiesce in or follow the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision\noutside of that circuit.\u201d Center for Regulatory Reasonableness\nv. EPA, 849 F.3d 453, 454 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n\n     As evidence that the EPA likely had records of a decision\nnot to acquiesce in Iowa League of Cities, Hall\u2019s November\n2014 FOIA request cited trade press publications and reports\nof the National Association of Clean Water Administrators\n(\u201cWater Administrators Association\u201d) describing public\nstatements by two EPA officials. Specifically, at a November\n20\u201322, 2013 meeting of the Water Administrators Association,\nthe EPA\u2019s then Acting Assistant Administrator for Water,\nNancy Stoner, was reported to have stated that Iowa League of\nCities was \u201cnot binding\u201d outside of the Eighth Circuit, and that\nthe EPA would look \u201con a case-by-case [basis] at situations in\n\n     1\n       Nor did the EPA seek an extension of the time to file a\ncertiorari petition. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c) (allowing a Justice of the\nSupreme Court to grant an extension of up to sixty days for good\ncause shown); see also SUP. CT. R. 13 (same).\n\f                              6\nparticular communities\u201d outside of that circuit to determine\nwhether to enforce the vacated EPA rules. J.A. 73\u201374, 159,\n273. Then, at the National Water Policy Forum & Fly-In on\nApril 9, 2014, Stoner and Mark Pollins, Director of the Water\nEnforcement Division in the EPA\u2019s Office of Civil\nEnforcement, were said to have reiterated the EPA\u2019s \u201cposition\nthat Iowa League of Cities is not binding * * * outside of the\n[Eighth] Circuit\u201d and that it \u201cwould continue to apply the\n[vacated rules] outside of that area.\u201d J.A. 74.\n\n     Against that backdrop, Hall\u2019s FOIA request sought from\nthe EPA:\n\n       1. Any EPA records which discuss whether or\n          not Ms. Stoner\u2019s November 2013 statement\n          was accurately reported in the trade press;\n       2. Any talking points and/or other materials\n          prepared for Ms. Stoner and/or Mr. Pollins\n          in advance of their presentations at either of\n          the above-referenced events or used by\n          them at the events;\n       3. Any presentation materials EPA distributed\n          as part of the aforementioned presentations;\n       4. Any records that either Ms. Stoner or Mr.\n          Pollins created as part of their respective\n          presentations; and\n       5. Any records that either Ms. Stoner or Mr.\n          Pollins created in preparation for their\n          respective presentations.\n\nJ.A. 74. Hall subsequently clarified that the request pertained\n\u201conly to documents mentioning EPA\u2019s thoughts on how the\nAgency would be proceeding post-[Iowa League of Cities]\ndecision.\u201d J.A. 78.\n\f                              7\n     The EPA responded to Hall\u2019s revised FOIA request with\nten responsive documents.\n\n     Document 1 is a November 15, 2013 email meeting invite\nentitled \u201cIowa League of Cities.\u201d J.A. 172. The meeting invite\nwas sent from Stoner to several high-level managers in the\nOffice of General Counsel and Office of Water, including\nSteven Neugeboren, Associate General Counsel of the Water\nLaw Office in the Office of General Counsel.\n\n     Document 1(a) is a three-page draft of talking points that\nwas attached to that meeting invite. Like Document 1, it was\ncreated on November 15, 2013. The talking points were\nauthored by Kevin Weiss, a staff engineer in the Water Permits\nDivision of the Office of Wastewater Management within the\nOffice of Water, for Weiss\u2019s coworkers and superiors. They\ndiscuss Iowa League of Cities, potential \u201cprogrammatic\nactivities [for the EPA], and potential communication options\u201d\nregarding the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision. J.A. 159.\n\n     Document 1(b), a five-page draft memorandum discussing\nthe same subjects as Document 1(a), was also attached to the\nmeeting invite and prepared by Weiss on November 15, 2013.\n\n    Document 2 is a November 14, 2013 email entitled: \u201cRE:\nIA League of Cities \u2013 deliberative process; atty client.\u201d J.A.\n162\u2013163. It was sent from Stoner to Neugeboren and several\nother EPA officials, including Weiss.\n\n   Document 3 is a November 15, 2013 email sent by\nNeugeboren responding to the Document 2 email.\n\n    Document 4 is a two-email thread from November 18,\n2013, involving Weiss, Deborah Nagle (Director of the Water\nPermits Division), and Connie Bosma (Chief of the Municipal\nBranch within the Water Permits Division). In the first email,\n\f                                8\nsent from Nagle to Bosma, Nagle stated that she was on her\nway to the Water Administrators Association seminar and\nknew Bosma had previously \u201carmed [Stoner] with talking\npoints on how [the EPA] intend[ed] to apply the [Iowa League\nof Cities] decision.\u201d J.A. 375. Nagle asked Bosma to forward\nher the talking points, \u201c[j]ust in case the topic comes up\u201d at the\nconference. J.A. 375.\n\n     The second email, sent that same day from Weiss to Nagle,\nattaches \u201cthe talking points [Weiss] gave to Nancy Stoner.\u201d\nJ.A. 166\u2013167, 375.         Those talking points constitute\nDocument 4(a) and are a later version of the Document 1(a)\ndraft talking points.\n\n     Also attached to that second email is Document 4(b), a\nfour-page document prepared by Weiss in November 2010.\nDocument 4(b) discusses potential regulatory approaches on\nthe part of the EPA to the matters governed by the two rules\nthat the Eighth Circuit later invalidated. Document 4(b) is the\nonly record produced by the EPA in response to Hall\u2019s FOIA\nrequest that was not created in November 2013.\n\n     Document 5 is a six-email thread involving Stoner,\nNeugeboren, other EPA officials, and Hall. The thread begins\nwith an email from Hall to Neugeboren on November 15, 2013,\nin which Hall states its understanding \u201cthat EPA informed the\npublic and several states that the [Iowa League of Cities]\ndecision does not apply outside of the [Eighth] Circuit,\u201d and\nasks Neugeboren \u201cto confirm or deny that EPA Headquarters\nhas reached a determination on this issue since * * * it was\n[Neugeboren] that made the announcement[.]\u201d J.A. 381\u2013382.\nNeugeboren forwarded the message to various EPA officials,\nincluding Stoner, and confirmed (internally) that he had\npublicly said \u201cthe decision is [b]inding in the [Eighth] Circuit\n\f                               9\nand that its implications outside are being considered by the\nagency.\u201d J.A. 188\u2013189.\n\n     Finally, Document 6 is a November 26, 2013 email from a\nstaff attorney advisor within the Water Enforcement Division\nto various EPA officials. The email forwards a Bloomberg\nBNA article reporting that the EPA would apply Iowa League\nof Cities \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d outside of the Eighth\nCircuit. J.A. 170\u2013171, 383. The staff attorney advisor states\nin the email his understanding that the EPA would \u201cnot apply\n[Iowa League of Cities] at all outside the Eighth Circuit[.]\u201d\nJ.A. 383 (emphasis added).\n\n     Of these ten responsive documents, the EPA initially\nreleased in full to Hall only Document 1\u2014the November 15,\n2013 email invite. The EPA withheld Documents 1(a), 1(b), 2,\n3, 4(a), and 4(b) in full. And it withheld portions of Documents\n4, 5, and 6.\n\n     The EPA invoked Exemption 5 to justify all of the\nwithholdings. In particular, the EPA asserted that all of the\nwithheld material fell under the deliberative process privilege\nbecause it was both \u201cpredecisional and deliberative\u201d in nature.\nJ.A. 97, 106. The EPA further claimed that some of the\nwithheld material also fell within the attorney-client privilege\nbecause it contained \u201cconfidential communications between\n[the EPA] and its attorney relating to a legal matter for which\n[the EPA] has sought professional advice.\u201d J.A. 97, 106.\n\n     On Hall\u2019s administrative appeal, the EPA narrowed the\nscope of records for which it claimed attorney-client privilege.\nBut it reaffirmed its view that all nine withheld records\nqualified for the deliberative process privilege. Nonetheless,\nbecause four of the fully withheld documents (Documents 1(a),\n1(b), 4(a), 4(b)) and one of the partially withheld documents\n(Document 6) each contained \u201csome reasonably segregable\n\f                                 10\ninformation,\u201d the EPA ordered that new redacted versions of\nthose five documents be provided to Hall. J.A. 106\u2013107.\n\n                                 C\n\n     Hall then sought judicial review of the withholdings by\nfiling this suit in the United States District Court for the District\nof Columbia. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\n\n     Hall\u2019s single-count complaint alleges that the EPA\nimproperly invoked the attorney-client and deliberative\nprocess privileges to justify its withholdings. The complaint\nasserts that the records were ineligible for withholding under\nthe deliberative process privilege because they were not\npredecisional: The EPA had \u201cclearly rendered a final decision\nregarding the national applicability of the [Iowa League of\nCities] decision\u201d by the time the records were created. J.A. 22.\n\n    The EPA filed with the district court a Vaughn Index\nexplaining its reasoning for each withholding. 2 It also\nsubmitted several declarations by Nagle insisting that the EPA\n\u201chas not, to date, decided whether and to what extent to follow\n[Iowa League of Cities] outside the Eighth Circuit, saving those\nquestions for permitting or other case-specific contexts.\u201d J.A.\n319. For that reason, Nagle concluded that, at the time the\ndocuments at issue were created, the EPA still \u201chad not\ndetermined whether and to what extent to apply the decision\noutside the Eighth Circuit and instead was evaluating any\n\n\n    2\n      A Vaughn Index \u201cconsists of a detailed affidavit, the purpose\nof which is to permit the court system effectively and efficiently to\nevaluate the factual nature of disputed information\u201d in a FOIA case.\nJohn Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 149 n.2 (1989)\n(formatting modified); see also Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 826\u2013\n828 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\n\f                                 11\nissues related to [Iowa League of Cities] on a facility-specific\nbasis.\u201d J.A. 319\u2013320.\n\n     Both parties moved for summary judgment. But before\nthose motions were resolved, Hall moved to amend its\ncomplaint to add a new challenge under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)\nto the adequacy of the EPA\u2019s initial search for relevant\ndocuments. Hall also moved (i) to conduct additional\ndiscovery into \u201cseveral material facts\u201d that remained \u201cin\ndispute,\u201d including \u201cthe timing and nature of EPA\u2019s\nnonacquiescence decision,\u201d and (ii) to strike one of Nagle\u2019s\ndeclarations for including assertedly false information, namely,\nher representations that the EPA had not yet made a decision\nabout whether it would follow Iowa League of Cities outside of\nthe Eighth Circuit.

EPA, No. 1:15-cv-01055-KBJ\n(Aug. 12, 2016), ECF No. 47-1.\n\n    After reviewing the materials in camera, the district court\ngranted in part and denied in part each of the parties\u2019 cross-\nmotions for summary judgment.\n\n     The district court began by rejecting the EPA\u2019s contention\nthat its current position\u2014that it would decide whether to apply\nIowa League of Cities on a case-by-case basis outside of the\nEighth Circuit\u2014did not amount to a nonacquiescence decision.\nThe court reasoned that, by reserving the \u201cright to proceed\n\u2018consistent with the Agency\u2019s existing interpretation\u2019 outside\nof the Eighth Circuit on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the EPA had\n\u201cnecessarily * * * refused to commit to applying Iowa League\nof Cities as its policy in all jurisdictions,\u201d and that is all that it\ntakes for an agency to adopt a policy of \u201cintercircuit\nnonacquiescence[.]\u201d J.A. 47 (formatting modified).\n\n   The district court then held, as a matter of law, that \u201cthe\nEPA made the nonacquiescence decision at issue here on\n\f                               12\nNovember 19, 2013,\u201d J.A. 43 (formatting modified), the date\nthat the EPA issued a press release (known as the \u201cDesk\nStatement\u201d) that read:\n\n       The Eighth Circuit\u2019s interpretation in Iowa\n       League of Cities v EPA of EPA\u2019s regulations\n       relating to blending and bypass is legally\n       binding within the Eighth Circuit. Outside of\n       the Eighth Circuit, EPA will continue to work\n       with States and communities with the goal of\n       finding solutions that protect public health and\n       the environment while recognizing economic\n       constraints and feasibility concerns, consistent\n       with the agency\u2019s existing interpretation of the\n       regulations.\n\nJ.A. 45\u201346 (district court analysis); J.A. 194 (Desk Statement).\nThe Desk Statement, the district court concluded, \u201camounted\nto a formal announcement of nonacquiescence,\nnotwithstanding the EPA\u2019s current protestations.\u201d J.A. 46.\n\n     In so holding, the district court rejected Hall\u2019s argument\nthat the record supported at least a reasonable inference that the\nEPA actually adopted its nonacquiescence position sometime\nbefore it issued the Desk Statement. As support for its\nargument, Hall had pointed to evidence of both internal and\npublic statements by EPA officials that predated the November\n19, 2013 Desk Statement. For example, Neugeboren stated\npublicly on November 13, 2013 (as referenced in Document 5):\n\u201cIt is EPA[\u2019s] current contention that the [Iowa League of\nCities] ruling will only be binding to the [Eighth] Circuit\nStates.\u201d J.A. 240, 381\u2013382. Hall also pointed to an internal\nAugust 2013 \u201cOptions Memo\u201d of the EPA outlining the pros\nand cons of petitioning or not petitioning for certiorari from the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s decision. J.A. 197\u2013199. The only \u201cPro\u201d\n\f                               13\nidentified in the Options Memo for not seeking certiorari was\nthat doing so would leave the EPA free to \u201cformally or\ninformally acquiesce and thereby limit the effect of the\ndecision to the Eighth Circuit.\u201d J.A. 199. As of October 8,\n2013, the government had decided not to seek certiorari.\n\n     Notwithstanding those materials, the district court held\nthat there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning the\ntiming of the EPA\u2019s nonacquiescence decision, reasoning that\nthe decision definitively was reached on November 19, 2013.\nThe court reasoned that (i) Neugeboren\u2019s earlier statement, on\nwhich Hall relied, \u201ccan reasonably be interpreted as the mere\nrecitation of a known fact: a decision of the Eighth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals does not \u2018bind\u2019 the EPA outside of the Eighth\nCircuit,\u201d and (ii) \u201can agency\u2019s decision to seek certiorari stands\ncompletely apart from a nonacquiescence determination.\u201d J.A.\n48\u201349.\n\n     Given its factual finding that the EPA\u2019s nonacquiescence\ndecision was not adopted until November 19th, the district\ncourt ruled that all of the withheld material except Document 6\n(prepared November 26, 2013) was predecisional and so met\nthe first eligibility requirement for withholding under the\ndeliberative process privilege.\n\n     Next, after reviewing the other withheld documents that\nwere created before November 19th, the district court\nconcluded that everything but Document 4 and small portions\nof Documents 1(a) and 1(b) was deliberative in nature and thus\nproperly withheld under Exemption 5. Because the EPA did\nnot separately assert attorney-client privilege over Documents\n1(a), 4, and 6, the district court ordered the release of\nDocuments 4 and 6 and the portions of Document 1(a) that\nwere not deliberative. As for the portion of Document 1(b) that\nwas not deliberative in nature, the district court ordered it\n\f                               14\nreleased after concluding that it also did not qualify for the\nattorney-client privilege.\n\n     To sum it all up, the district court ordered the EPA to\nrelease Documents 4 and 6 in full along with portions of\nDocuments 1(a) and 1(b). Conversely, it agreed with the EPA\nthat the deliberative process privilege justified withholding all\nor portions of Documents 1(a), 1(b), 2, 3, 4(a), 4(b), and 5.\n\n     The district court also denied Hall\u2019s motion to amend its\ncomplaint on the ground that Hall had failed to exhaust its\nclaim of an inadequate search before the EPA. And the court\ndenied as \u201c[m]eritless\u201d Hall\u2019s motions for discovery and to\nstrike the relevant Nagle Declaration. J.A. 64. The district\ncourt reasoned that both motions \u201cappear[ed] to be motivated\nby [Hall]\u2019s apparent belief that the EPA has responded to\n[Hall]\u2019s FOIA request in bad faith and has repeatedly lied to\nthis Court * * * to shield its nonacquiescence policy from\njudicial review,\u201d and then concluded that the record did not\nsupport such an assertion. J.A. 64\u201367. Rather, the EPA had\n\u201csimply failed to appreciate that the sentiment conveyed in the\nDesk Statement\u201d amounted to a nonacquiescence\ndetermination, which evidenced only an \u201cearnestly held but\nmistaken view of the law[.]\u201d J.A. 65.\n\n     Hall appealed; the EPA did not. The EPA has released the\ndocuments and portions of documents ordered to be disclosed\nby the district court.\n\n                               II\n\n    The district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction\nunder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). This court\u2019s jurisdiction arises\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\f                               15\n     We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision on summary\njudgment in a FOIA case. Sussman v. United States Marshals\nServ., 494 F.3d 1106, 1111\u20131112 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Summary\njudgment is appropriate only \u201cif the movant shows that there is\nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).\n\n     District courts have \u201cbroad discretion to manage the scope\nof discovery\u201d in FOIA cases. Safecard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926\nF.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991). We will overturn the\nexercise of that discretion \u201conly in unusual circumstances.\u201d Id.\nWe also review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to strike\nonly for an abuse of discretion. See Jackson v. Finnegan,\nHenderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, 101 F.3d 145, 150\n(D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n     Finally, leave to amend a complaint should be freely given\nwhen justice so requires. FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(2). \u201cWe review\na district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a complaint for\nabuse of discretion.\u201d Williams v. Lew, 819 F.3d 466, 471 (D.C.\nCir. 2016). It is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend\nwithout \u201csufficient reason, such as * * * futility of\namendment.\u201d Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C.\nCir. 1996) (formatting modified). Amendment is futile if the\namended complaint would not withstand a motion to dismiss.\nHettinga v. United States, 677 F.3d 471, 480 (D.C. Cir. 2012).\nA complaint will, in turn, survive a motion to dismiss if it\ncontains \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a\nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f                                16\n                               III\n\n                                A\n\n                                1\n\n      The indispensable predicate for a grant of summary\njudgment is that there be no genuine dispute over a question of\nmaterial fact. See Solomon v. Vilsack, 763 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir.\n2014) (\u201cOur task is not to determine the truth of the matter, but\nto decide only whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d)\n(formatting modified). Even then, the law must dictate a single\noutcome after taking all of the facts and reasonable inferences\nfrom them in the light most favorable to the non-movant\u2014here,\nHall. See Al-Saffy v. Vilsack, 827 F.3d 85, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2016)\n(\u201cIf, on the other hand, any material facts are at issue or, though\nundisputed, are susceptible to divergent inferences, summary\njudgment must be denied.\u201d); see also Steele v. Mattis, 899 F.3d\n943, 947 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (\u201c[S]ummary judgment is proper\nonly when, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n[the non-moving party] and drawing all reasonable inferences\naccordingly, no reasonable jury could find in [the non-moving\nparty\u2019s] favor.\u201d) (formatting modified).\n\n     Said another way, if any reasonable view of the record\nwould permit resolution of a factual dispute in favor of the non-\nmovant, and that fact is material to the outcome, summary\njudgment must be denied. FOIA cases are no exception. See,\ne.g., Evans v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 951 F.3d 578, 584,\n586\u2013588 (D.C. Cir. 2020).\n\n                                2\n\n     For purposes of this appeal, there is no dispute that the\nEPA\u2019s position in the Desk Statement\u2014that (i) Iowa League of\nCities was \u201clegally binding within the Eighth Circuit,\u201d and (ii)\n\f                               17\noutside of that circuit, the EPA would \u201ccontinue to work with\nStates and communities * * * consistent with the Agency\u2019s\nexisting interpretation of the regulations\u201d\u2014is a\nnonacquiescence decision. J.A. 45; EPA Br. 9 n.3.\n\n     The critical question is only one of timing: Whether the\nEPA, as a matter of law, carried its burden of establishing that\nits nonacquiescence decision was reached only after all of the\ndocuments at issue here were created. See Assassination\nArchives & Research Ctr. v. CIA, 334 F.3d 55, 57 (D.C. Cir.\n2003) (The agency \u201cbears the burden of establishing the\napplicability of [a] claimed [FOIA] exemption.\u201d); see also 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he burden is on the agency to\nsustain its action.\u201d). That factual question of timing is\nmaterial\u2014actually, dispositive\u2014in deciding (i) which of the\nEPA documents that Hall seeks were created prior to the EPA\u2019s\nnonacquiescence decision, and so satisfy the first requirement\nfor withholding under the deliberative process privilege, and\n(ii) which were generated after the decision was made, and so\ncannot be withheld under that privilege.\n\n     The district court misstepped in this case because it\ngranted summary judgment to the EPA by resolving against\nHall that quintessentially factual dispute concerning the date on\nwhich the nonacquiescence position was first adopted. Hall\u2019s\nproffered evidence, the EPA\u2019s own submissions (including its\nVaughn Index and the three Nagle declarations), and our own\nin camera review of the withheld materials offer up a buffet of\ndifferent dates by which the nonacquiescence decision might\nhave been adopted. Those dates include, but are not confined\nto, the time of the Desk Statement. The summary judgment\nrecord simply does not dictate an answer to that factual\nquestion.\n\f                               18\n     For starters, take the EPA\u2019s own submissions in district\ncourt. There the EPA argued that no decision about\nacquiescence had ever been made, meaning that every\ndocument was predecisional. The EPA\u2019s Vaughn Index insists\nthat the Agency \u201chas not, to date, decided whether and to what\nextent to follow the Iowa League of Cities\u2019 decision outside the\nEight[h] Circuit, saving those questions for permitting or other\ncase-specific contexts.\u201d J.A. 160. Nagle\u2019s first declaration\nmakes that same point in identical terms. The EPA, in fact,\nadmits that it never took the position in district court that\nNovember 19th was the date that it made \u201ca nonacquiescence\ndetermination (because the EPA argued that it never made a\nnonacquiescence decision)[.]\u201d       EPA Br. 16 (formatting\nmodified). So not only did no party argue in district court that\nNovember 19th was the date of nonacquiescence\u2014both parties\nargued that it was not. Given that, nothing in the EPA\u2019s\nsubmissions pointed to a date certain for when it finally settled\non a nonacquiescence position, other than \u201cnot yet.\u201d\n\n    Nevertheless, the EPA defends the district court\u2019s grant of\nsummary judgment on the ground that the record as a whole\nconclusively establishes that the position communicated in the\nDesk Statement was not \u201creached\u201d before November 19, 2013.\nEPA Br. 17.\n\n      That is simply wrong. As mentioned, the EPA submitted\nlittle to no evidence speaking directly to the timing question,\nand no direct evidence at all that the date was November 19th.\nAnd Hall, for its part, has identified sufficient evidence to\nsupport a reasonable inference that the EPA reached its\nnonacquiescence position sometime before November 19th.\n\n     First, on November 13th\u2014six days before the Desk\nStatement\u2014EPA\u2019s Associate General Counsel Neugeboren\npublicly stated that the EPA\u2019s \u201ccurrent contention [is] that the\n\f                                 19\nCourt ruling will only be binding to the [Eighth] Circuit\nStates,\u201d and that \u201cStates will have to deal with the situation on\na case-by-case basis.\u201d J.A. 240. Neugeboren then matched the\nEPA\u2019s actions to his words, elaborating that the Agency would\nbe \u201creviewing permits on a case-by-case basis\u201d outside of the\nEighth Circuit. J.A. 240. Because the EPA now accepts that a\npolicy in which it \u201crefuse[s] to commit to applying Iowa\nLeague of Cities as its policy in all jurisdictions * * * is all that\nintercircuit nonacquiescence requires,\u201d J.A. 47, the\nNeugeboren statement raises a material factual dispute about\nwhether the date of nonacquiescence was as early as November\n13, 2013\u2014before all but one of the withheld documents were\ncreated.\n\n     To be sure, as the district court noted, Neugeboren\ncommented later in his remarks that the EPA did not \u201chave\neverything figured out yet\u201d and would \u201cbe looking for a more\nholistic approach to managing the utility in question.\u201d J.A.\n240. Based on those caveats, the district court concluded that\nNeugeboren\u2019s statement \u201ccan reasonably be interpreted as the\nmere recitation of a known fact: a decision of the Eighth\nCircuit * * * does not \u2018bind\u2019 the EPA outside of the Eighth\nCircuit.\u201d J.A. 49.\n\n     Sure, the document could be read that way. But it does not\nhave to be. It could just as reasonably be read to support Hall.\nAnd it is Hall\u2014not the EPA\u2014who is entitled at this stage to\nall reasonable inferences from the evidence.                When\nNeugeboren\u2019s statement is read in context, and in the light most\nfavorable to Hall, it was just as likely that Neugeboren was\nreferring to ironing out the details of the EPA\u2019s implementation\nof its nonacquiescence decision, not its adoption. In fact, the\nEPA included the same sorts of caveats in describing its\nposition three years later, after it had long since settled on not\nacquiescing. See, e.g., J.A. 167 (Vaughn Index asserting that\n\f                              20\nthe EPA \u201chas not, to date, decided whether and to what extent\nto follow [the] Iowa League of Cities decision outside the\nEight[h] Circuit, saving those questions for permitting or other\ncase-specific contexts\u201d). So the EPA must agree that such\ncomments are entirely compatible with having already adopted\na nonacquiescence position. Given that, on the summary\njudgment record before us, it is certainly reasonable to infer\nfrom Neugeboren\u2019s public statement that the nonacquiescence\nposition articulated in the Desk Statement was reached at least\na few days earlier.\n\n     Other documents in the record support a reasonable\ninference that the nonacquiescence decision was reached still\nearlier. In August 2013, when the EPA was considering\nwhether to seek certiorari, the internal Options Memo outlined\npotential pros and cons of filing or not filing such a petition.\nJ.A. 197\u2013199. The only \u201cPro\u201d listed in the Options Memo for\nnot seeking certiorari was that the EPA would be free to\n\u201cformally or informally acquiesce and thereby limit the effect\nof the decision to the Eighth Circuit.\u201d J.A. 199. So it is also\nreasonable to infer from the Options Memo that, when the EPA\ndeclined to seek certiorari by the October 8, 2013 deadline, it\nwas because it had decided not to acquiesce.\n\n     Consistent with the district court\u2019s analysis, the EPA\nargues that a decision to seek certiorari is different from a\ndecision not to apply Iowa League of Cities outside of the\nEighth Circuit. EPA Br. 17. Fair enough. That the EPA\ndeclined to seek certiorari by no means conclusively\nestablishes that it had decided by then not to acquiesce. But\nagain, an inference need not be the only possible interpretation\nof the evidence to preclude summary judgment. All that is\nneeded is a reasonable inference. See Steele, 899 F.3d at 947.\nBecause the EPA specifically labeled the ability not to\nacquiesce as the \u201cPro\u201d for not seeking certiorari, it is\n\f                                 21\nreasonable to infer that when it declined to seek certiorari it had\nsettled on exercising that prerogative. 3\n\n     At bottom, now that the EPA accepts the district court\u2019s\nlegal holding that it made a nonacquiescence decision in\nNovember 2013, the summary judgment record leaves\nmaterially disputed and unanswered when exactly that decision\nwas made. Neither party below argued that November 19th\nwas the definitive date, and record evidence points to a variety\nof possible answers. We hold only that, applying the summary\njudgment standard, the EPA has not established as a matter of\nindisputable fact that the definitive date of nonacquiescence\nwas November 19, 2013. Because the EPA did not meet its\nburden of demonstrating conclusively that its nonacquiescence\ndetermination postdates the creation of all of the still-withheld\ndocuments, the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment to the EPA.\n\n\n\n     3\n       Hall also points to an internal October 29, 2013 memorandum\n(\u201cMoving Forward Memo\u201d) as raising a genuine issue of material\nfact that the EPA had reached its nonacquiescence position at least\nby that date. Hall Br. 29\u201331. After arguing that the Moving Forward\nMemo does not establish such a genuine issue of material fact, the\nEPA goes on to briefly assert that the memorandum is a privileged\ndocument that is not even \u201cproperly part of the record in this case\nand therefore should not be considered in this appeal.\u201d EPA Br. 24.\nThe EPA voiced similar objections to the district court after Hall\nintroduced the memorandum into evidence. But the district court\nwas apparently unpersuaded, as it explicitly discussed the Moving\nForward Memo in resolving the summary judgment motions. See\nJ.A. 35. Nonetheless, because documents both parties agree are part\nof the record establish a genuine and disputed issue of material fact,\nwe need not resolve the dispute over the Moving Forward Memo.\nOn remand, the district court can resolve any such claims of privilege\nthat the EPA may again raise.\n\f                                 22\n                                  B\n\n      Hall asks this court to go further and hold that the district\ncourt erred in not entering summary judgment in its favor by\ndisallowing the deliberative process privilege. Hall Br. 18\u201319.\nHall reasons that, because the district court rejected the EPA\u2019s\nonly justification for invoking that privilege\u2014that is, that it had\n\u201cnever rendered or communicated a nonacquiescence decision\nto anyone at any time,\u201d Hall Br. 18 (formatting modified)\u2014the\ndistrict court had no choice but to grant summary judgment in\nfull in its favor.\n\n     But Hall overplays its hand. That position suffers from the\nsame factual indeterminacy about timing that infected the\ndistrict court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the EPA. That\nthe EPA erred in claiming a decisional date of \u201cnever\u201d does\nnot, by itself, establish that all of the documents were\npostdecisional. Again, the record is about as clear as mud on\nwhen the EPA finally decided to not acquiesce. And while\neach party sees its position in the mire, we see only a record\nthat does not conclusively establish whether the withheld\nmaterials were created either before or after the EPA reached\nits decision. Summary judgment does not work in either\ndirection on this dispute. 4\n\n                                 C\n\n     None of Hall\u2019s other objections succeed.\n\n    First, Hall argues that the district court erred in denying its\nmotion to conduct additional discovery into \u201cseveral material\n\n     4\n      Our vacatur of the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision\nmoots Hall\u2019s procedural objection under Rule 56(f) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure to the district court\u2019s sua sponte selection,\nwithout advance notice, of a nonacquiescence date. Hall Br. 19\u201323.\n\f                                23\nfacts\u201d that remained \u201cin dispute,\u201d including \u201cthe timing and\nnature of EPA\u2019s nonacquiescence decision[.]\u201d Memorandum\nof Points and Authorities, supra, at 40; Hall Br. 35\u201339.\nBecause we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment, we leave it to the district court to decide what steps\nare necessary to resolve the case consistent with our opinion.\n\n     Second, Hall argues that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying Hall\u2019s motion to amend its complaint to\nadd a challenge to the adequacy of the EPA\u2019s search for\nresponsive documents. Hall does not dispute that it failed to\nadministratively exhaust that claim as the law generally\nrequires. See, e.g., Bayala v. Department of Homeland Sec.,\n827 F.3d 31, 35\u201336 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (discussing FOIA\u2019s\nexhaustion requirement).\n\n     Hall argues instead that the failure to exhaust is excused\nbecause the potential inadequacy of the EPA\u2019s search for\nrecords first \u201carose during the litigation and not at the time of\nFOIA denial[.]\u201d Hall Br. 40. Specifically, Hall contends that\nthe EPA\u2019s FOIA response \u201cneither identified the existence of,\nnor sought to withhold, the Desk Statement.\u201d Id.\n\n     That is true, but beside the point. The EPA never\nmentioned the Desk Statement in its FOIA response because\nthat document was not responsive to Hall\u2019s narrow FOIA\nrequest. That request sought only records regarding the\npresentations made by (i) Stoner at the Water Administrators\nAssociation seminar held November 20\u201322, 2013, and (ii)\nStoner and Pollins at the April 9, 2014 forum. The Desk\nStatement fit neither of those bills. So Hall\u2019s failure to exhaust\nis fatal to its argument. 5\n\n\n    5\n       As it turns out, the EPA disclosed the Desk Statement to Hall\nin response to a different FOIA request. J.A. 146, 148.\n\f                                24\n     Third, Hall argues that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying Hall\u2019s motion to strike one of Nagle\u2019s\ndeclarations for wrongly denying that a nonacquiescence\ndecision had been made. Hall Br. 41\u201342. Not so. The district\ncourt found that Nagle\u2019s statements that no nonacquiescence\ndecision had been made reflected only \u201can earnestly held but\nmistaken view of the law,\u201d not a factual misrepresentation.\nJ.A. 65. That judgment was reasoned and well within the\ndistrict court\u2019s discretion. Nothing in the law compels a district\ncourt to strike an entire declaration that includes relevant\nfactual representations simply because the declaration also\ncontains genuinely believed, but mistaken conclusions of law.\n\n                                IV\n\n     In conclusion, the district court erred in entering summary\njudgment for the EPA. A genuine issue of material fact\nremains as to when the EPA adopted its nonacquiescence\ndecision\u2014whether before or on the date of the Desk Statement.\nThat factual dispute is critical to application of the deliberative\nprocess privilege. For those reasons, we vacate the district\ncourt\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the EPA and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                     So ordered.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued October 10, 2019                Decided April 21, 2020\n\n                         No. 18-5241\n\n          HALL & ASSOCIATES, FOIA REQUESTER,\n                     APPELLANT\n\n                              v.\n\n           ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,\n                      APPELLEE\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court\n                for the District of Columbia\n                    (No. 1:15-cv-01055)\n\n\n    John C.

The records related to the EPA\u2019s purported adoption\nof a \u201cnonacquiescence decision\u201d\u2014that is, a determination to\nnot follow a specific court of appeals\u2019 judgment in cases arising\noutside of that circuit.

The\nEPA does not contest on appeal that this position amounted to\na nonacquiescence decision.\n\n     The central dispute in this appeal is one of timing. Did the\nEPA settle on its nonacquiescence position at the time of that\npress statement on November 19, 2013, or in the days leading\nup to it? Or even earlier? The answer to the timing question\nwill determine whether documents regarding that\nnonacquiescence decision\u2014all but one of which were created\nbetween November 14, 2013 and November 18, 2013\u2014are\npredecisional and, as such, may qualify for withholding under\nthe EPA\u2019s deliberative process privilege.\n\n    Because the date on which the EPA reached a final\ndecision to not acquiesce remains a genuine issue of disputed\nmaterial fact, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary\n\f                               3\njudgment in favor of the EPA and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n    Congress enacted FOIA \u201cto pierce the veil of\nadministrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of\npublic scrutiny.\u201d Bartko v.

Specifically, at a November\n20\u201322, 2013 meeting of the Water Administrators Association,\nthe EPA\u2019s then Acting Assistant Administrator for Water,\nNancy Stoner, was reported to have stated that Iowa League of\nCities was \u201cnot binding\u201d outside of the Eighth Circuit, and that\nthe EPA would look \u201con a case-by-case [basis] at situations in\n\n     1\n       Nor did the EPA seek an extension of the time to file a\ncertiorari petition.

Then, at the National Water Policy Forum & Fly-In on\nApril 9, 2014, Stoner and Mark Pollins, Director of the Water\nEnforcement Division in the EPA\u2019s Office of Civil\nEnforcement, were said to have reiterated the EPA\u2019s \u201cposition\nthat Iowa League of Cities is not binding * * * outside of the\n[Eighth] Circuit\u201d and that it \u201cwould continue to apply the\n[vacated rules] outside of that area.\u201d J.A. 74.\n\n     Against that backdrop, Hall\u2019s FOIA request sought from\nthe EPA:\n\n       1. Any EPA records which discuss whether or\n          not Ms. Stoner\u2019s November 2013 statement\n          was accurately reported in the trade press;\n       2.

The talking points were\nauthored by Kevin Weiss, a staff engineer in the Water Permits\nDivision of the Office of Wastewater Management within the\nOffice of Water, for Weiss\u2019s coworkers and superiors. They\ndiscuss Iowa League of Cities, potential \u201cprogrammatic\nactivities [for the EPA], and potential communication options\u201d\nregarding the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision.

In the first email,\n\f                                8\nsent from Nagle to Bosma, Nagle stated that she was on her\nway to the Water Administrators Association seminar and\nknew Bosma had previously \u201carmed [Stoner] with talking\npoints on how [the EPA] intend[ed] to apply the [Iowa League\nof Cities] decision.\u201d J.A. 375. Nagle asked Bosma to forward\nher the talking points, \u201c[j]ust in case the topic comes up\u201d at the\nconference. J.A. 375.\n\n     The second email, sent that same day from Weiss to Nagle,\nattaches \u201cthe talking points [Weiss] gave to Nancy Stoner.\u201d\nJ.A. 166\u2013167, 375.         Those talking points constitute\nDocument 4(a) and are a later version of the Document 1(a)\ndraft talking points.\n\n     Also attached to that second email is Document 4(b), a\nfour-page document prepared by Weiss in November 2010.\nDocument 4(b) discusses potential regulatory approaches on\nthe part of the EPA to the matters governed by the two rules\nthat the Eighth Circuit later invalidated. Document 4(b) is the\nonly record produced by the EPA in response to Hall\u2019s FOIA\nrequest that was not created in November 2013.\n\n     Document 5 is a six-email thread involving Stoner,\nNeugeboren, other EPA officials, and Hall. The thread begins\nwith an email from Hall to Neugeboren on November 15, 2013,\nin which Hall states its understanding \u201cthat EPA informed the\npublic and several states that the [Iowa League of Cities]\ndecision does not apply outside of the [Eighth] Circuit,\u201d and\nasks Neugeboren \u201cto confirm or deny that EPA Headquarters\nhas reached a determination on this issue since * * * it was\n[Neugeboren] that made the announcement[.]\u201d J.A. 381\u2013382.\nNeugeboren forwarded the message to various EPA officials,\nincluding Stoner, and confirmed (internally) that he had\npublicly said \u201cthe decision is [b]inding in the [Eighth] Circuit\n\f                               9\nand that its implications outside are being considered by the\nagency.\u201d J.A. 188\u2013189.\n\n     Finally, Document 6 is a November 26, 2013 email from a\nstaff attorney advisor within the Water Enforcement Division\nto various EPA officials. The email forwards a Bloomberg\nBNA article reporting that the EPA would apply Iowa League\nof Cities \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d outside of the Eighth\nCircuit. J.A. 170\u2013171, 383. The staff attorney advisor states\nin the email his understanding that the EPA would \u201cnot apply\n[Iowa League of Cities] at all outside the Eighth Circuit[.]\u201d\nJ.A. 383 (emphasis added).\n\n     Of these ten responsive documents, the EPA initially\nreleased in full to Hall only Document 1\u2014the November 15,\n2013 email invite. The EPA withheld Documents 1(a), 1(b), 2,\n3, 4(a), and 4(b) in full. And it withheld portions of Documents\n4, 5, and 6.\n\n     The EPA invoked Exemption 5 to justify all of the\nwithholdings. In particular, the EPA asserted that all of the\nwithheld material fell under the deliberative process privilege\nbecause it was both \u201cpredecisional and deliberative\u201d in nature.\nJ.A. 97, 106. The EPA further claimed that some of the\nwithheld material also fell within the attorney-client privilege\nbecause it contained \u201cconfidential communications between\n[the EPA] and its attorney relating to a legal matter for which\n[the EPA] has sought professional advice.\u201d J.A. 97, 106.\n\n     On Hall\u2019s administrative appeal, the EPA narrowed the\nscope of records for which it claimed attorney-client privilege.\nBut it reaffirmed its view that all nine withheld records\nqualified for the deliberative process privilege. Nonetheless,\nbecause four of the fully withheld documents (Documents 1(a),\n1(b), 4(a), 4(b)) and one of the partially withheld documents\n(Document 6) each contained \u201csome reasonably segregable\n\f                                 10\ninformation,\u201d the EPA ordered that new redacted versions of\nthose five documents be provided to Hall. J.A. 106\u2013107.\n\n                                 C\n\n     Hall then sought judicial review of the withholdings by\nfiling this suit in the United States District Court for the District\nof Columbia. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\n\n     Hall\u2019s single-count complaint alleges that the EPA\nimproperly invoked the attorney-client and deliberative\nprocess privileges to justify its withholdings. The complaint\nasserts that the records were ineligible for withholding under\nthe deliberative process privilege because they were not\npredecisional: The EPA had \u201cclearly rendered a final decision\nregarding the national applicability of the [Iowa League of\nCities] decision\u201d by the time the records were created.

EPA, No. 1:15-cv-01055-KBJ\n(Aug. 12, 2016), ECF No. 47-1.\n\n    After reviewing the materials in camera, the district court\ngranted in part and denied in part each of the parties\u2019 cross-\nmotions for summary judgment.\n\n     The district court began by rejecting the EPA\u2019s contention\nthat its current position\u2014that it would decide whether to apply\nIowa League of Cities on a case-by-case basis outside of the\nEighth Circuit\u2014did not amount to a nonacquiescence decision.\nThe court reasoned that, by reserving the \u201cright to proceed\n\u2018consistent with the Agency\u2019s existing interpretation\u2019 outside\nof the Eighth Circuit on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the EPA had\n\u201cnecessarily * * * refused to commit to applying Iowa League\nof Cities as its policy in all jurisdictions,\u201d and that is all that it\ntakes for an agency to adopt a policy of \u201cintercircuit\nnonacquiescence[.]\u201d J.A. 47 (formatting modified).\n\n   The district court then held, as a matter of law, that \u201cthe\nEPA made the nonacquiescence decision at issue here on\n\f                               12\nNovember 19, 2013,\u201d J.A. 43 (formatting modified), the date\nthat the EPA issued a press release (known as the \u201cDesk\nStatement\u201d) that read:\n\n       The Eighth Circuit\u2019s interpretation in Iowa\n       League of Cities v EPA of EPA\u2019s regulations\n       relating to blending and bypass is legally\n       binding within the Eighth Circuit. Outside of\n       the Eighth Circuit, EPA will continue to work\n       with States and communities with the goal of\n       finding solutions that protect public health and\n       the environment while recognizing economic\n       constraints and feasibility concerns, consistent\n       with the agency\u2019s existing interpretation of the\n       regulations.\n\nJ.A. 45\u201346 (district court analysis); J.A. 194 (Desk Statement).\nThe Desk Statement, the district court concluded, \u201camounted\nto a formal announcement of nonacquiescence,\nnotwithstanding the EPA\u2019s current protestations.\u201d J.A. 46.\n\n     In so holding, the district court rejected Hall\u2019s argument\nthat the record supported at least a reasonable inference that the\nEPA actually adopted its nonacquiescence position sometime\nbefore it issued the Desk Statement. As support for its\nargument, Hall had pointed to evidence of both internal and\npublic statements by EPA officials that predated the November\n19, 2013 Desk Statement. For example, Neugeboren stated\npublicly on November 13, 2013 (as referenced in Document 5):\n\u201cIt is EPA[\u2019s] current contention that the [Iowa League of\nCities] ruling will only be binding to the [Eighth] Circuit\nStates.\u201d J.A. 240, 381\u2013382. Hall also pointed to an internal\nAugust 2013 \u201cOptions Memo\u201d of the EPA outlining the pros\nand cons of petitioning or not petitioning for certiorari from the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s decision. J.A. 197\u2013199. The only \u201cPro\u201d\n\f                               13\nidentified in the Options Memo for not seeking certiorari was\nthat doing so would leave the EPA free to \u201cformally or\ninformally acquiesce and thereby limit the effect of the\ndecision to the Eighth Circuit.\u201d J.A. 199. As of October 8,\n2013, the government had decided not to seek certiorari.\n\n     Notwithstanding those materials, the district court held\nthat there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning the\ntiming of the EPA\u2019s nonacquiescence decision, reasoning that\nthe decision definitively was reached on November 19, 2013.\nThe court reasoned that (i) Neugeboren\u2019s earlier statement, on\nwhich Hall relied, \u201ccan reasonably be interpreted as the mere\nrecitation of a known fact: a decision of the Eighth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals does not \u2018bind\u2019 the EPA outside of the Eighth\nCircuit,\u201d and (ii) \u201can agency\u2019s decision to seek certiorari stands\ncompletely apart from a nonacquiescence determination.\u201d J.A.\n48\u201349.\n\n     Given its factual finding that the EPA\u2019s nonacquiescence\ndecision was not adopted until November 19th, the district\ncourt ruled that all of the withheld material except Document 6\n(prepared November 26, 2013) was predecisional and so met\nthe first eligibility requirement for withholding under the\ndeliberative process privilege.\n\n     Next, after reviewing the other withheld documents that\nwere created before November 19th, the district court\nconcluded that everything but Document 4 and small portions\nof Documents 1(a) and 1(b) was deliberative in nature and thus\nproperly withheld under Exemption 5. Because the EPA did\nnot separately assert attorney-client privilege over Documents\n1(a), 4, and 6, the district court ordered the release of\nDocuments 4 and 6 and the portions of Document 1(a) that\nwere not deliberative. As for the portion of Document 1(b) that\nwas not deliberative in nature, the district court ordered it\n\f                               14\nreleased after concluding that it also did not qualify for the\nattorney-client privilege.\n\n     To sum it all up, the district court ordered the EPA to\nrelease Documents 4 and 6 in full along with portions of\nDocuments 1(a) and 1(b). Conversely, it agreed with the EPA\nthat the deliberative process privilege justified withholding all\nor portions of Documents 1(a), 1(b), 2, 3, 4(a), 4(b), and 5.\n\n     The district court also denied Hall\u2019s motion to amend its\ncomplaint on the ground that Hall had failed to exhaust its\nclaim of an inadequate search before the EPA. And the court\ndenied as \u201c[m]eritless\u201d Hall\u2019s motions for discovery and to\nstrike the relevant Nagle Declaration. J.A. 64. The district\ncourt reasoned that both motions \u201cappear[ed] to be motivated\nby [Hall]\u2019s apparent belief that the EPA has responded to\n[Hall]\u2019s FOIA request in bad faith and has repeatedly lied to\nthis Court * * * to shield its nonacquiescence policy from\njudicial review,\u201d and then concluded that the record did not\nsupport such an assertion. J.A. 64\u201367. Rather, the EPA had\n\u201csimply failed to appreciate that the sentiment conveyed in the\nDesk Statement\u201d amounted to a nonacquiescence\ndetermination, which evidenced only an \u201cearnestly held but\nmistaken view of the law[.]\u201d J.A. 65.\n\n     Hall appealed; the EPA did not. The EPA has released the\ndocuments and portions of documents ordered to be disclosed\nby the district court.\n\n                               II\n\n    The district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction\nunder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).

Cir. 2020).\n\n                                2\n\n     For purposes of this appeal, there is no dispute that the\nEPA\u2019s position in the Desk Statement\u2014that (i) Iowa League of\nCities was \u201clegally binding within the Eighth Circuit,\u201d and (ii)\n\f                               17\noutside of that circuit, the EPA would \u201ccontinue to work with\nStates and communities * * * consistent with the Agency\u2019s\nexisting interpretation of the regulations\u201d\u2014is a\nnonacquiescence decision. J.A. 45; EPA Br. 9 n.3.\n\n     The critical question is only one of timing: Whether the\nEPA, as a matter of law, carried its burden of establishing that\nits nonacquiescence decision was reached only after all of the\ndocuments at issue here were created. See Assassination\nArchives & Research Ctr. v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186016\"><a href=\"/opinion/186016/assassination-archv-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (D.C.

That factual question of timing is\nmaterial\u2014actually, dispositive\u2014in deciding (i) which of the\nEPA documents that Hall seeks were created prior to the EPA\u2019s\nnonacquiescence decision, and so satisfy the first requirement\nfor withholding under the deliberative process privilege, and\n(ii) which were generated after the decision was made, and so\ncannot be withheld under that privilege.\n\n     The district court misstepped in this case because it\ngranted summary judgment to the EPA by resolving against\nHall that quintessentially factual dispute concerning the date on\nwhich the nonacquiescence position was first adopted. Hall\u2019s\nproffered evidence, the EPA\u2019s own submissions (including its\nVaughn Index and the three Nagle declarations), and our own\nin camera review of the withheld materials offer up a buffet of\ndifferent dates by which the nonacquiescence decision might\nhave been adopted. Those dates include, but are not confined\nto, the time of the Desk Statement. The summary judgment\nrecord simply does not dictate an answer to that factual\nquestion.\n\f                               18\n     For starters, take the EPA\u2019s own submissions in district\ncourt. There the EPA argued that no decision about\nacquiescence had ever been made, meaning that every\ndocument was predecisional. The EPA\u2019s Vaughn Index insists\nthat the Agency \u201chas not, to date, decided whether and to what\nextent to follow the Iowa League of Cities\u2019 decision outside the\nEight[h] Circuit, saving those questions for permitting or other\ncase-specific contexts.\u201d J.A. 160. Nagle\u2019s first declaration\nmakes that same point in identical terms. The EPA, in fact,\nadmits that it never took the position in district court that\nNovember 19th was the date that it made \u201ca nonacquiescence\ndetermination (because the EPA argued that it never made a\nnonacquiescence decision)[.]\u201d       EPA Br. 16 (formatting\nmodified). So not only did no party argue in district court that\nNovember 19th was the date of nonacquiescence\u2014both parties\nargued that it was not. Given that, nothing in the EPA\u2019s\nsubmissions pointed to a date certain for when it finally settled\non a nonacquiescence position, other than \u201cnot yet.\u201d\n\n    Nevertheless, the EPA defends the district court\u2019s grant of\nsummary judgment on the ground that the record as a whole\nconclusively establishes that the position communicated in the\nDesk Statement was not \u201creached\u201d before November 19, 2013.\nEPA Br. 17.\n\n      That is simply wrong. As mentioned, the EPA submitted\nlittle to no evidence speaking directly to the timing question,\nand no direct evidence at all that the date was November 19th.\nAnd Hall, for its part, has identified sufficient evidence to\nsupport a reasonable inference that the EPA reached its\nnonacquiescence position sometime before November 19th.\n\n     First, on November 13th\u2014six days before the Desk\nStatement\u2014EPA\u2019s Associate General Counsel Neugeboren\npublicly stated that the EPA\u2019s \u201ccurrent contention [is] that the\n\f                                 19\nCourt ruling will only be binding to the [Eighth] Circuit\nStates,\u201d and that \u201cStates will have to deal with the situation on\na case-by-case basis.\u201d J.A. 240. Neugeboren then matched the\nEPA\u2019s actions to his words, elaborating that the Agency would\nbe \u201creviewing permits on a case-by-case basis\u201d outside of the\nEighth Circuit. J.A. 240. Because the EPA now accepts that a\npolicy in which it \u201crefuse[s] to commit to applying Iowa\nLeague of Cities as its policy in all jurisdictions * * * is all that\nintercircuit nonacquiescence requires,\u201d J.A. 47, the\nNeugeboren statement raises a material factual dispute about\nwhether the date of nonacquiescence was as early as November\n13, 2013\u2014before all but one of the withheld documents were\ncreated.\n\n     To be sure, as the district court noted, Neugeboren\ncommented later in his remarks that the EPA did not \u201chave\neverything figured out yet\u201d and would \u201cbe looking for a more\nholistic approach to managing the utility in question.\u201d J.A.\n240. Based on those caveats, the district court concluded that\nNeugeboren\u2019s statement \u201ccan reasonably be interpreted as the\nmere recitation of a known fact: a decision of the Eighth\nCircuit * * * does not \u2018bind\u2019 the EPA outside of the Eighth\nCircuit.\u201d J.A. 49.\n\n     Sure, the document could be read that way. But it does not\nhave to be. It could just as reasonably be read to support Hall.\nAnd it is Hall\u2014not the EPA\u2014who is entitled at this stage to\nall reasonable inferences from the evidence.                When\nNeugeboren\u2019s statement is read in context, and in the light most\nfavorable to Hall, it was just as likely that Neugeboren was\nreferring to ironing out the details of the EPA\u2019s implementation\nof its nonacquiescence decision, not its adoption. In fact, the\nEPA included the same sorts of caveats in describing its\nposition three years later, after it had long since settled on not\nacquiescing. See, e.g., J.A. 167 (Vaughn Index asserting that\n\f                              20\nthe EPA \u201chas not, to date, decided whether and to what extent\nto follow [the] Iowa League of Cities decision outside the\nEight[h] Circuit, saving those questions for permitting or other\ncase-specific contexts\u201d). So the EPA must agree that such\ncomments are entirely compatible with having already adopted\na nonacquiescence position. Given that, on the summary\njudgment record before us, it is certainly reasonable to infer\nfrom Neugeboren\u2019s public statement that the nonacquiescence\nposition articulated in the Desk Statement was reached at least\na few days earlier.\n\n     Other documents in the record support a reasonable\ninference that the nonacquiescence decision was reached still\nearlier. In August 2013, when the EPA was considering\nwhether to seek certiorari, the internal Options Memo outlined\npotential pros and cons of filing or not filing such a petition.\nJ.A. 197\u2013199. The only \u201cPro\u201d listed in the Options Memo for\nnot seeking certiorari was that the EPA would be free to\n\u201cformally or informally acquiesce and thereby limit the effect\nof the decision to the Eighth Circuit.\u201d J.A. 199. So it is also\nreasonable to infer from the Options Memo that, when the EPA\ndeclined to seek certiorari by the October 8, 2013 deadline, it\nwas because it had decided not to acquiesce.\n\n     Consistent with the district court\u2019s analysis, the EPA\nargues that a decision to seek certiorari is different from a\ndecision not to apply Iowa League of Cities outside of the\nEighth Circuit. EPA Br. 17. Fair enough. That the EPA\ndeclined to seek certiorari by no means conclusively\nestablishes that it had decided by then not to acquiesce. But\nagain, an inference need not be the only possible interpretation\nof the evidence to preclude summary judgment. All that is\nneeded is a reasonable inference. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Steele,</span> <span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">947</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nBecause the EPA specifically labeled the ability not to\nacquiesce as the \u201cPro\u201d for not seeking certiorari, it is\n\f                                 21\nreasonable to infer that when it declined to seek certiorari it had\nsettled on exercising that prerogative. 3\n\n     At bottom, now that the EPA accepts the district court\u2019s\nlegal holding that it made a nonacquiescence decision in\nNovember 2013, the summary judgment record leaves\nmaterially disputed and unanswered when exactly that decision\nwas made. Neither party below argued that November 19th\nwas the definitive date, and record evidence points to a variety\nof possible answers. We hold only that, applying the summary\njudgment standard, the EPA has not established as a matter of\nindisputable fact that the definitive date of nonacquiescence\nwas November 19, 2013. Because the EPA did not meet its\nburden of demonstrating conclusively that its nonacquiescence\ndetermination postdates the creation of all of the still-withheld\ndocuments, the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment to the EPA.\n\n\n\n     3\n       Hall also points to an internal October 29, 2013 memorandum\n(\u201cMoving Forward Memo\u201d) as raising a genuine issue of material\nfact that the EPA had reached its nonacquiescence position at least\nby that date. Hall Br. 29\u201331. After arguing that the Moving Forward\nMemo does not establish such a genuine issue of material fact, the\nEPA goes on to briefly assert that the memorandum is a privileged\ndocument that is not even \u201cproperly part of the record in this case\nand therefore should not be considered in this appeal.\u201d EPA Br. 24.\nThe EPA voiced similar objections to the district court after Hall\nintroduced the memorandum into evidence. But the district court\nwas apparently unpersuaded, as it explicitly discussed the Moving\nForward Memo in resolving the summary judgment motions. See\nJ.A. 35. Nonetheless, because documents both parties agree are part\nof the record establish a genuine and disputed issue of material fact,\nwe need not resolve the dispute over the Moving Forward Memo.\nOn remand, the district court can resolve any such claims of privilege\nthat the EPA may again raise.\n\f                                 22\n                                  B\n\n      Hall asks this court to go further and hold that the district\ncourt erred in not entering summary judgment in its favor by\ndisallowing the deliberative process privilege. Hall Br. 18\u201319.\nHall reasons that, because the district court rejected the EPA\u2019s\nonly justification for invoking that privilege\u2014that is, that it had\n\u201cnever rendered or communicated a nonacquiescence decision\nto anyone at any time,\u201d Hall Br. 18 (formatting modified)\u2014the\ndistrict court had no choice but to grant summary judgment in\nfull in its favor.\n\n     But Hall overplays its hand. That position suffers from the\nsame factual indeterminacy about timing that infected the\ndistrict court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the EPA. That\nthe EPA erred in claiming a decisional date of \u201cnever\u201d does\nnot, by itself, establish that all of the documents were\npostdecisional. Again, the record is about as clear as mud on\nwhen the EPA finally decided to not acquiesce. And while\neach party sees its position in the mire, we see only a record\nthat does not conclusively establish whether the withheld\nmaterials were created either before or after the EPA reached\nits decision. Summary judgment does not work in either\ndirection on this dispute. 4\n\n                                 C\n\n     None of Hall\u2019s other objections succeed.\n\n    First, Hall argues that the district court erred in denying its\nmotion to conduct additional discovery into \u201cseveral material\n\n     4\n      Our vacatur of the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision\nmoots Hall\u2019s procedural objection under Rule 56(f) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure to the district court\u2019s sua sponte selection,\nwithout advance notice, of a nonacquiescence date. Hall Br. 19\u201323.\n\f                                23\nfacts\u201d that remained \u201cin dispute,\u201d including \u201cthe timing and\nnature of EPA\u2019s nonacquiescence decision[.]\u201d Memorandum\nof Points and </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Authorities,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">40</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Hall Br. 35\u201339.\nBecause we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment, we leave it to the district court to decide what steps\nare necessary to resolve the case consistent with our opinion.\n\n     Second, Hall argues that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying Hall\u2019s motion to amend its complaint to\nadd a challenge to the adequacy of the EPA\u2019s search for\nresponsive documents. Hall does not dispute that it failed to\nadministratively exhaust that claim as the law generally\nrequires. See, e.g., Bayala v. Department of Homeland Sec.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35\u201336 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (discussing FOIA\u2019s\nexhaustion requirement).\n\n     Hall argues instead that the failure to exhaust is excused\nbecause the potential inadequacy of the EPA\u2019s search for\nrecords first \u201carose during the litigation and not at the time of\nFOIA denial[.]\u201d Hall Br. 40. Specifically, Hall contends that\nthe EPA\u2019s FOIA response \u201cneither identified the existence of,\nnor sought to withhold, the Desk Statement.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\n     That is </span><pre class=\"inline\">true, but beside the point. The EPA never\nmentioned the Desk Statement in its FOIA response because\nthat document was not responsive to Hall\u2019s narrow FOIA\nrequest. That request sought only records regarding the\npresentations made by (i) Stoner at the Water Administrators\nAssociation seminar held November 20\u201322, 2013, and (ii)\nStoner and Pollins at the April 9, 2014 forum. The Desk\nStatement fit neither of those bills. So Hall\u2019s failure to exhaust\nis fatal to its argument. 5\n\n\n    5\n       As it turns out, the EPA disclosed the Desk Statement to Hall\nin response to a different FOIA request. J.A. 146, 148.\n\f                                24\n     Third, Hall argues that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying Hall\u2019s motion to strike one of Nagle\u2019s\ndeclarations for wrongly denying that a nonacquiescence\ndecision had been made. Hall Br. 41\u201342. Not so. The district\ncourt found that Nagle\u2019s statements that no nonacquiescence\ndecision had been made reflected only \u201can earnestly held but\nmistaken view of the law,\u201d not a factual misrepresentation.\nJ.A. 65. That judgment was reasoned and well within the\ndistrict court\u2019s discretion. Nothing in the law compels a district\ncourt to strike an entire declaration that includes relevant\nfactual representations simply because the declaration also\ncontains genuinely believed, but mistaken conclusions of law.\n\n                                IV\n\n     In conclusion, the district court erred in entering summary\njudgment for the EPA. A genuine issue of material fact\nremains as to when the EPA adopted its nonacquiescence\ndecision\u2014whether before or on the date of the Desk Statement.\nThat factual dispute is critical to application of the deliberative\nprocess privilege. For those reasons, we vacate the district\ncourt\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the EPA and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                     So ordered.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112224/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186016/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/627203/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/712999/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/313449/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/556586/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/375896/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145875/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/729929/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112344/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109241/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186972/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4527400/", "id": 4527400, "absolute_url": "/opinion/4747053/louisiana-environmental-action-v-epa/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/4747053/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "date_created": "2020-04-21T16:00:37.161183Z", "date_modified": "2020-04-21T16:21:29.733171Z", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "9f6330267565be76970307d2a2aa17a5c8f946da", "page_count": 25, "download_url": "https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/0A35374BE6759CD08525855100529EFE/$file/17-1257-1838999.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2020/04/21/louisiana_environmental_action_v._epa.pdf", "plain_text": " United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued December 4, 2019               Decided April 21, 2020\n\n                        No. 17-1257\n\n   LOUISIANA ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION NETWORK, ET AL.,\n                    PETITIONERS\n\n                              v.\n\n    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND ANDREW\n     WHEELER, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL\n                PROTECTION AGENCY,\n                    RESPONDENTS\n\n         AMERICAN FOREST & PAPER ASSOCIATION,\n                     INTERVENOR\n\n\n                 Consolidated with 18-1245\n\n\n       On Petitions for Review of Final Action by the\n       United States Environmental Protection Agency\n\n\n     James S.

It is well\nestablished under our precedent that the Act requires each\nsource category\u2019s emission standard to address every\nrecognized hazardous pollutant that the source category is\nknown to emit. See Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 233 F.3d 625,\n634 (D.C. Cir. 2000). No party seriously disputes that\ninterpretation, nor could it. The problem here is that in\npromulgating the emission standard for pulp mill combustion\nsources in 2001 EPA addressed some but not all the hazardous\nair pollutants they are known to emit. See Final Rule: National\nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical\n\f                                3\nRecovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and\nStand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills, 66 Fed. Reg. 3,180\n(Jan. 12, 2001) (2001 Rule) (codified at 40 C.F.R. pt. 63, subpt.\nMM).\n\n     In the past when EPA left out requisite limits from a source\ncategory\u2019s emission standard, it has acted during its\ncongressionally mandated periodic review of that standard\nunder section 112(d)(6) to revise it to include the necessary\nlimits. The Act requires EPA every eight years to \u201creview, and\nrevise as necessary\u201d each of the \u201cemission standards\u201d it has\npromulgated under section 112\u2014and to do so \u201ctaking into\naccount developments in practices, processes, and control\ntechnologies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). In 2017, EPA\n(belatedly) conducted its first section 112(d)(6) review and\nrevision of the 2001 pulp mill combustion source emission\nstandard, but this time it decided to review only the standard\u2019s\nlimits on emissions of the toxics the standard already\ncontrolled, leaving unlimited several other hazardous toxics\nthat the sources are known to emit but that were left out of the\n2001 Rule. See Final Rule: National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical Recovery Combustion\nSources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical\nPulp Mills, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,238 (Oct. 11, 2017) (2017 Rule).\n\n     The parties here dispute whether it was \u201cnecessary\u201d under\nsection 112(d)(6) for EPA to calculate the missing emission\nlimits and \u201crevise\u201d the incomplete \u201cemission standard\u201d\npromulgated in 2001 to include them.                Environmental\npetitioners challenge as both contrary to law and arbitrary the\n2017 Rule\u2019s failure to correct the standard\u2019s acknowledged\nunder-inclusiveness during the section 112(d)(6) review. EPA\nagrees that the Act requires it to set controls in accordance with\nthe method described in section 112(d)(2)-(3) for every air\ntoxic a source category emits. As counsel for EPA put it at oral\n\f                               4\nargument, \u201c[t]his case is not about whether EPA has an\nobligation to set emission standards for each and every [air\ntoxic] from a source category: It does. National Lime in 2000\nestablished that.\u201d Oral Arg. Rec. at 17:53-18:08. But EPA\ncontends that section 112(d)(6) is unambiguous in confining\nthe requisite periodic review to whatever pollutants an existing\nstandard already controls, and \u201ccreates no obligation for EPA\u201d\nto consider any \u201cpollutants not previously addressed.\u201d EPA\nBr. 2. EPA thinks Congress left the Agency to decide when to\nfinish the job: In EPA\u2019s view, it may but is not required to\naddress during section 112(d)(6) review any listed but still\nuncontrolled hazardous air pollutants the source category\nemits. And the Agency says it decided not to do so here\nbecause of time constraints that, it claims, left it with\ninadequate information to calibrate the limits. Intervenor\nAmerican Forest and Paper Association takes a more restrictive\nview of EPA\u2019s authority, insisting that, to protect industry\u2019s\nentitlement to repose, any challenge to the standard\u2019s under-\ninclusiveness of listed air toxics should have been brought\nwithin 60 days after the 2001 Rule. See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Petitioners respond that they have timely raised\na meritorious challenge to EPA\u2019s 2017 Rule. Petitioners also\nchallenge EPA\u2019s denial of their petition for reconsideration,\ncontending that EPA\u2019s central rationale\u2014that it lacked time to\npromulgate the missing limits, and had no legal obligation to\ndo so during its section 112(d)(6) review\u2014appeared for the\nfirst time in the Final Rule, depriving the public of an\nopportunity to comment.\n\n     We hold that, because the Act necessitates section 112-\ncompliant emission standards for each source category, and\nsection 112(d)(6) requires EPA at least every eight years to\nreview and revise emission standards \u201cas necessary,\u201d EPA\u2019s\nsection 112(d)(6) review of a source category\u2019s emission\nstandard must address all listed air toxics the source category\n\f                                5\nemits. The 2017 Rule failed to do so. We accordingly grant\nthe petition and remand the 2017 Rule without vacatur, and\ndirect EPA to set limits on the listed air toxics that pulp mill\ncombustion sources are known to emit but that EPA has yet to\ncontrol. In light of the remand, we dismiss as moot the denial\nof the petition for reconsideration.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     A. The Clean Air Act Amendments\n\n     When Congress enacted the Clean Air Amendments of\n1970, it directed EPA to identify and regulate hazardous air\npollutants. Pub. L. No. 91-604, \u00a7 4(a), 84 Stat. 1676, 1678-80\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7407-09). Two decades\non, \u201c[d]issatisfied with EPA\u2019s progress in identifying\nhazardous air pollutants, Congress amended the Act in 1990 to\nname nearly 200 such pollutants\u201d and \u201ccharged EPA with\nidentifying sources of those pollutants and setting emission\nstandards for them.\u201d Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n for Surface Finishing v. EPA,\n795 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n, 233 F.3d\nat 634 (\u201cCongress added the list of pollutants to be regulated,\nregulation deadlines, and minimum stringency requirements to\nthe Clean Air Act precisely because it believed EPA had failed\nto regulate enough HAPs [Hazardous Air Pollutants] under\nprevious air toxics provisions.\u201d). The initial list of air toxics\nthat Congress compiled to make up for EPA\u2019s slow start\nappears at section 112(b)(1). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(1).\n\n     Section 112 of the Act, added as part of the 1990\nAmendments, mandates EPA\u2019s regulation of those listed air\ntoxics. See Clean Air Act Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-549,\n\u00a7 301, 104 Stat. 2399, 2531-74 (1990) (1990 Amendments).\nSection 112(b) calls on EPA to build on the initial list Congress\ncreated to maintain an up-to-date list of air toxics. To that end,\nthe Act requires EPA periodically to review and revise the list\n\f                                6\nby rule. Id. \u00a7 7412(b)(2). In addition, \u201cany person\u201d may\npetition EPA to add a hazardous air pollutant to the list or delete\none from it, and Congress directed that EPA grant or deny such\npetition within 18 months. Id. \u00a7 7412(b)(3)(A). The listed air\ntoxics include known carcinogens as well as substances\ncausing serious non-cancer health effects to various bodily\norgans and systems\u2014including nerves, heart, lungs, liver, skin,\nand reproductive systems\u2014and to fetal development. Many of\nthese toxics affect people\u2019s health through multiple pathways\n(water, soil, food, air), are persistent (meaning that, once\nemitted, they linger in the environment), and bio-accumulative\n(such that small amounts inhaled or otherwise absorbed by\nbodily tissues build up over time, thereby intensifying\nassociated health risks).\n\n     To control emissions of the listed air toxics, EPA must\n\u201cpromulgate regulations establishing emission standards for\neach category or subcategory of major sources.\u201d              Id.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(1). The Clean Air Act currently lists 190 hazardous\npollutants. More than a hundred pulp mill chemical recovery\ncombustion sources operating in the United States collectively\nemit more than 23 million pounds of those air toxics annually.\nSee Proposed Rule: National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical Recovery Combustion\nSources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical\nPulp Mills, 81 Fed. Reg. 97,046, 97,082 (Dec. 30, 2016) (2016\nProposed Rule). Those chemical recovery combustion sources\nare an identified subset of the sources of hazardous emissions\nat pulp mills. Pulp mills work to mush, grind, or dissolve wood\nand other materials into pulp, typically used to make paper.\nThe pulping process creates a chemical liquor byproduct that\ncontains some of the original pulping chemicals. Pulp mills\ncan recover these chemicals for reuse through a variety of\nchemical processes as well as generate energy through\nincinerating other residual organic matter. These \u201cchemical\n\f                               7\nrecovery combustion sources\u201d are the only sources of\nemissions regulated by the 2001 and 2017 Rules. Id. at 97,051-\n52.\n\n     Each source category\u2019s \u201cemission standard\u201d must specify\nthe source\u2019s maximum allowable emission \u201cof hazardous air\npollutants listed for regulation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1). In\nother words, each \u201cemission standard\u201d includes limits on\nemissions of air toxics from a particular kind of air polluter.\nAn emission standard must contain limits for each listed air\ntoxic the relevant category of source emits. Id. \u00a7 7412(d)(1)-\n(3); see also, e.g., Sierra Club v. EPA, 479 F.3d 875, 878, 883\n(D.C. Cir. 2007) (reiterating EPA\u2019s clear statutory obligation\nto set limits on all air toxics a source emits, and invalidating\n\u201cno control\u201d emission floors for brick and ceramics kilns);\nMossville Envtl. Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1232, 1236,\n1242 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (reading section 112(d)(1) clearly to\nrequire limits \u201cfor every HAP emitted from each category or\nsubcategory of major sources\u201d and invalidating standard\ngoverning polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturers that\ncontrolled only vinyl chloride); Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n, 233 F.3d at\n634 (recognizing EPA\u2019s \u201cclear statutory obligation to set\nemission standards for each listed HAP\u201d and invalidating\nstandard governing brick and ceramics kilns that placed \u201cno\ncontrol\u201d floors on their emissions of hydrogen chloride,\nmercury, and hydrocarbons). The existing standard governing\npulp mill combustion sources limits a handful of the listed air\ntoxics those sources emit but sets no limit on many others.\n\n    Section 112(d)(2)-(3) prescribes the method by which\nEPA, in promulgating an emission standard, must calibrate\nsource-specific limits on emission of each air toxic.\nSpecifically, for existing major sources, EPA must \u201crequire the\nmaximum degree of reduction in emissions\u201d by the particular\nsource category that the Agency \u201cdetermines is achievable.\u201d\n\f                               8\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2). To that end, the Act directs EPA to\ncalculate the average level of emissions of each air toxic\nachieved by the best-performing 12 percent of facilities in a\ngiven source category\u2014those that emit the toxic at the lowest\nlevels. Id. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A). That baseline emissions limit is\nreferred to as the \u201cmaximum achievable control technology\u201d\nfloor or \u201cMACT floor.\u201d Sierra Club v. EPA, 895 F.3d 1, 7-8\n(D.C. Cir. 2018). EPA must then determine, considering cost,\nhealth, and environmental effects, whether a more stringent\nlimit is \u201cachievable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7412(d)(2). If so, EPA must\npromulgate a \u201cbeyond-the-floor\u201d limit at that more stringent\nlevel. Surface Finishing, 795 F.3d at 5.\n\n      When Congress amended the Act in 1990 to jumpstart\nimplementation, it set a stringent timeline for EPA\u2019s hazardous\nair pollutant regulation. Congress required EPA to promulgate\nstandards for every area source and major source category and\nsubcategory in the United States \u201cas expeditiously as\npracticable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(e)(1). It set an overall deadline\nfor EPA to regulate all identified air toxics emitted by any\ncovered source within 10 years of the Act\u2019s effective date\u2014\ni.e., by November 15, 2000. Id. \u00a7 7412(e)(1)(E). To propel\nEPA to act, Congress set interim milestones. It directed EPA\nto finalize standards for at least forty categories of sources\nwithin two years of the effective date, id. \u00a7 7412(e)(1)(A), each\nof which had to address all the listed pollutants the source\ncategory emits, id. \u00a7 7412(b)(1). Congress further specified\nthat EPA must finalize standards for 25 percent of source\ncategories and subcategories within four years, id.\n\u00a7 7412(e)(1)(C), and at least another 25 percent within seven\nyears of the Act\u2019s effective date, id. \u00a7 7412(e)(1)(D).\n\n    The provision at issue here, section 112(d)(6), requires\nEPA, on an ongoing periodic basis, to revisit and update\nemission standards that it has already set for each source. No\n\f                               9\nless than every eight years, EPA must \u201creview, and revise as\nnecessary (taking into account developments in practices,\nprocesses, and control technologies), emission standards\npromulgated under this section.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). That review\nensures that, over time, EPA maintains source standards\ncompliant with the law and on pace with emerging\ndevelopments that create opportunities to do even better.\n\n     In addition to its section 112(d)(6) review, EPA under\nsection 112(f)(2) must conduct a one-time review within 8\nyears of promulgating an emission standard to, among other\nthings, evaluate the residual risk to the public from each source\ncategory\u2019s emissions and promulgate more stringent limits as\nnecessary \u201cto provide an ample margin of safety to protect\npublic health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7412(f)(2)(A). Petitioners do not here\nchallenge EPA\u2019s section 112(f)(2) risk assessment.\n\n   B.    History of the 2017 Rule\n\n     After notice and comment, EPA in 2001 promulgated\nnational emission standards to control hazardous air pollutants\nemitted by \u201cnew and existing sources used in chemical\nrecovery processes at kraft, soda, sulfite, and stand-alone\nsemichemical pulp mills.\u201d 2001 Rule, 66 Fed. Reg. at 3,180.\nWe refer to this regulated source, which includes recovery\nfurnaces, smelt dissolving tanks, and lime kilns at pulp mills,\nas \u201cpulp mill combustion sources.\u201d See id. at 3,181-82. The\n2001 Rule failed to include any limit on some of the hazardous\nair pollutants that pulp mill combustion sources emitted, but\nnobody challenged it at the time.\n\n    In 2009, Sierra Club and other environmental nonprofit\norganizations petitioned EPA to conduct a rulemaking to\ncontrol the air toxics the 2001 Rule overlooked. As relevant\nhere, they urged the Agency to set limits for dozens of\nadditional hazardous air pollutants that pulp mill combustion\n\f                               10\nsources were known to emit. More than a decade later, EPA\nhas not responded to that petition, nor have petitioners sued on\ngrounds of unreasonable delay to enjoin the Agency to do so.\n\n     In February 2011, EPA issued an Information Collection\nRequest asking pulp and paper manufacturers for information\nneeded to conduct its section 112(d)(6) review, as well as its\nsection 112(f)(2) \u201crisk review.\u201d Its request sought updated\ninventory data for all pulp and paper emission sources, and\navailable information on chemical recovery combustion\nequipment and control devices currently in use. See 2016\nProposed Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 97,052. Despite a 100 percent\nresponse rate from manufacturers providing the requested\ninformation, id., EPA did not take needed action to revise the\nemission standard for pulp mill combustion sources to limit any\nof the listed but as-yet uncontrolled air toxics.\n\n     Sierra Club and California Communities Against Toxics\nsued EPA in 2015 in the Northern District of California under\nthe citizen-suit provision of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7604, challenging the Agency\u2019s failure to conduct the\nstatutorily required follow-up reviews for pulp mill combustion\nsources. See Sierra Club v. McCarthy, No. 15 Civ. 1165\n(HSG), 2016 WL 1055120 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 15, 2016). EPA\nagreed that it had failed to fulfill its mandatory rulemaking\nduties under sections 112(d)(6) and (f)(2) of the Act, and asked\nonly for sufficient time within which to do so. Id. at *1. After\ncarefully examining EPA\u2019s representations about what it had\ndone so far against what it had yet to do, the court in early 2016\nordered EPA to issue final determinations on both reviews by\nOctober 1, 2017. Id. at *7. EPA did not object to that timeline,\nnor did it at any time seek to extend it.\n\n    Mindful of its court-ordered timeline, EPA in December\n2016 solicited notice and comment on a proposed revision of\n\f                               11\nthe emission standard for pulp mill combustion sources. See\n2016 Proposed Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 97,046. EPA announced\nit was conducting the requisite residual-risk review under\nsection 112(f)(2) and a \u201ctechnology review\u201d under section\n112(d)(6). Id. at 97,048. It proposed some changes to the 2001\nRule, but none to address the lack of limits on many of the\nhazardous air pollutants the pulp mill combustion sources emit.\nPetitioner Sierra Club commented on the 2016 Proposed Rule\nand emphasized that section 112(d)(6) requires EPA to set\nlimits on previously uncontrolled hazardous air pollutants.\nIntervenor American Forest and Paper Association also\ncommented, insisting for its part that \u201cEPA has no obligation\nto expand the scope of the existing standards and does not in\nfact have statutory authority to do so.\u201d Joint Appendix (J.A.)\n374.\n\n    EPA, in its September 2017 response to comments,\nacknowledged that \u201cstandards for certain combinations of\npollutants and processes in the . . . [pulp mill combustion]\nsource category have not been promulgated.\u201d J.A. 378. Only\nthen did EPA announce that, although it has the authority \u201cto\ndevelop standards under 112(d)(2) and (3) for previously\nunregulated pollutants at the same time the Agency completes\nthe section 112(d)(6) review, nothing in section 112(d)(6)\nexpressly requires the EPA to do so as part of that review.\u201d Id.\n\n     In October 2017, EPA promulgated its Final Rule without\nsetting any limits for those hazardous air pollutants it\nacknowledges it must regulate but that it had omitted from the\n2001 standard for pulp mill combustion sources. See 2017\nRule, 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,335. Apart from its disclaimer of any\nobligation to do so under section 112(d)(6), EPA\u2019s sole\nexplanation for not including the requisite limits was that \u201c[t]he\ncompressed schedule for this rulemaking, due to the court-\nordered deadline, did not make it reasonable to appropriately\n\f                              12\nevaluate new standards for unregulated pollutants and\nprocesses.\u201d Id.\n\n    C. Procedural History\n\n     On December 11, 2017, Petitioners Louisiana\nEnvironmental Network, PT Air Watchers, and Sierra Club\nsought review of the 2017 Rule in this court and also petitioned\nEPA for reconsideration. EPA denied the petition for\nreconsideration on July 9, 2018. See National Emission\nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical Recovery\nCombustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone\nSemichemical Pulp Mills, 83 Fed. Reg. 32,213 (July 12, 2018).\nPetitioners sought our review of that denial on September 10,\n2018, and we consolidated the petition challenging the denial\nof reconsideration with their earlier petition for review of the\n2017 Rule.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\n    A. Jurisdiction\n\n     We have jurisdiction under section 307(b)(1) of the Act to\nreview EPA\u2019s Final Rule. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). EPA does\nnot contest Petitioners\u2019 standing, but Intervenor argues that\nPetitioners lack an injury in fact and, in any event, have not\nshown any redressable injury. Petitioners submitted six\nmember declarations in support of their organizational\nstanding, two from each of the three Petitioner organizations.\nAll of the members allege that they experience various\nsymptoms that they attribute to emissions from neighboring\npulp mills, and each alleges having curtailed favored activities\naccordingly. \u201c[E]nvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege\ninjury in fact when they aver that they used the affected area\nand are persons \u2018for whom the aesthetic and recreational values\nof the area will be lessened\u2019 by the challenged activity.\u201d\n\f                               13\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,\n528 U.S. 167, 183 (2000) (quoting Sierra Club v. Morton, 405\nU.S. 727, 735 (1972)). The alleged injuries readily meet that\nstandard.\n\n     B. EPA\u2019s Duty Periodically to Revise Major Sources\u2019\n        Emission Standards as Necessary Requires\n        Adding Missing Limits on Air Toxics the Source\n        Emits\n\n     Section 112(d)(6) is the statutory mechanism for\nreviewing and updating emission standards applicable to listed\nsources. It requires that, no less often than every eight years,\nEPA \u201cshall review, and revise as necessary (taking into account\ndevelopments in practices, processes, and control\ntechnologies), emission standards promulgated under this\nsection.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). The question here is\nwhether, when EPA undertakes those updates, it must add\nlimits, calculated consistent with section 112(d)(2)-(3), for any\nair toxics the source emits that the existing standard does not\naddress. In past section 112(d)(6) reviews of other sources\u2019\nemission standards, EPA has updated the standards to include\nlimits for hazardous air pollutants that the sources emit but the\nAgency had not previously limited. See, e.g., Final Rule:\nNational Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for\nMineral Wool Production and Wool Fiberglass Manufacturing,\n80 Fed. Reg. 45,280, 45,311 (July 29, 2015); Final Rule:\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant\nEmissions: Hard and Decorative Chromium Electroplating and\nChromium Anodizing Tanks, 77 Fed. Reg. 58,220, 58,238\n(Sept. 19, 2012). At oral argument both Petitioners and EPA\nrepresented that EPA had previously always updated its\nstandards to set limits on unregulated air toxics in the course of\nits section 112(d)(6) review. Oral Arg. Rec. at 5:02-5:38\n(Petitioners); id. at 18:29-19:20 (EPA). EPA later identified\n\f                               14\nthree section 112(d)(6) reviews during which it did not set\nlimits on previously unaddressed air toxics. See EPA 28(j)\nLetter (Dec. 10, 2019) (citing 80 Fed. Reg. 75,178 (Dec. 1,\n2015); 77 Fed. Reg. 55,698 (Sept. 11, 2012); 76 Fed. Reg.\n70,834 (Nov. 15, 2011)); see also Pet\u2019rs 28(j) Response (Dec.\n17, 2019) (not disputing EPA\u2019s characterization). EPA argued\nhere that its past practice of adding missing limits during\nsection 112(d)(6) review was optional, and that the Act grants\nit discretion whether or not to bring underinclusive standards\ninto compliance with section 112(d)(2)-(3) when conducting its\nperiodic section 112(d)(6) review.\n\n     There is no dispute that the Act requires EPA to have in\nplace emission standards to control all the listed pollutants that\na source category emits, and requires the Agency to revise\nexisting standards that are underinclusive to add section\n112(d)(2)-(3) controls for listed but unaddressed pollutants.\nThe only question is whether EPA lawfully may complete a\nsection 112(d)(6) review and \u201crevise\u201d an existing,\nunderinclusive emission standard \u201cas necessary\u201d without\nsupplying the missing controls. Put differently, the issue is\nwhether section 112(d)(6)\u2019s periodic, mandatory review and\nrevision \u201cas necessary\u201d is textually confined to those air toxics\nalready limited under the source\u2019s existing emission standard,\nor whether that provision compels consideration of the\nadequacy of the emission standard to control all the air toxics\nthe source category emits.\n\n     We read the statutory text to require EPA during its section\n112(d)(6) review to establish any missing limits. Because we\nconclude that the text of the statute unambiguously supports\nPetitioners\u2019 reading, we resolve the case without resort to any\ndeference to EPA under Chevron, USA, Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467\nU.S. 837 (1984).\n\f                                15\n     Two key features of the statutory language make clear that\nEPA\u2019s duty periodically to review and revise existing standards\nunder section 112(d) encompasses a mandate to add missing\nlimits:\n\n     First, the \u201cstandards\u201d to which section 112(d)(6) refers\u2014\nthe \u201cemission standards promulgated under this subsection\u201d\u2014\nare statutorily defined as comprehensive controls for each\nsource category that must include limits on each hazardous air\npollutant the category emits. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1)-(3),\n(6). The statutory definitions EPA points to do not support its\ncontention that an emission standard is a limit on an individual\npollutant, as opposed to a regulation governing the set of\npollutants emitted by a source category. The Act\u2019s \u201cgenerally\napplicable definition,\u201d EPA Br. 5, describes an emission\nstandard as governing \u201cemissions\u201d of \u201cpollutants\u201d plural,\nspecifically, \u201ca requirement . . . which limits the quantity, rate,\nor concentration of emissions of air pollutants,\u201d id. \u00a7 7602(k).\nThe regulatory definition it says is \u201c[m]ore particular to the\nAct\u2019s hazardous air pollutant program,\u201d EPA Br. 5, merely\nrefers back to a \u201cnational standard . . . promulgated in a subpart\nof this part pursuant to sections 112(d), 112(h), or 112(f) of the\nAct,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.2. And, in calling for \u201cemission standards\nfor each category or subcategory of major sources of hazardous\nair pollutants listed for regulation,\u201d section 112(d) defines air\npollution \u201cemission standards\u201d as source-specific, not toxic-\nspecific. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1). Accordingly, as used in\nsection 112(d), an emission standard includes as many limits as\nneeded to control all the emitted air toxics of a particular source\ncategory.\n\n    EPA also urges that what counts as an emission standard\n\u201cpromulgated\u201d under section 112 is frozen once EPA\ncompletes its initial promulgation, meaning that section\n112(d)(6)\u2019s reference to an \u201cemission standard[] promulgated\u201d\n\f                              16\nunder section 112 would reach only the subset of air toxics a\nsource\u2019s existing standard addressed.           But \u201cemission\nstandards\u201d under section 112(d)(6) are not constrained by past,\npotentially flawed and underinclusive agency action, as EPA\nnow suggests.       Congress\u2019 requirement that EPA must\nperiodically review and revise as necessary its \u201cemission\nstandards\u201d is a mandate to address the adequacy of each\nemission standard on the books against the statutory demand of\nsection 112(d)(2) for an \u201cemission standard\u201d for each source\ncategory\u2014one with the requisite degree of control of all of the\nair toxics the source emits. The obligatory periodic review and\nrevision of \u201cemission standards\u201d thus must ensure that each\nsource category\u2019s standard imposes appropriate limits\u2014not\njust on whatever subset of toxics the existing standard\naddressed, but on all the toxics the source category emits.\n\n     The second textual reason to read section 112(d)(6) to\nrequire EPA to add missing controls is the subsection\u2019s\nmandate to \u201crevise\u201d emission standards \u201cas necessary.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). Again, the core demand of section 112 is\nthat EPA promulgate emission standards for every source\ncategory addressing all listed hazardous air pollutants. And\nCongress established deadlines to make clear that time is of the\nessence. We conclude that when EPA reviews an existing\nstandard that fails to address many of the listed air toxics the\nsource category emits, adding limits for those overlooked\ntoxics is a \u201cnecessary\u201d revision under section 112(d)(6).\n\n     EPA asks us to read the statutory phrase\u2014\u201cas necessary\n(taking into account developments in practices, processes, and\ncontrol technologies),\u201d id.\u2014to require only changes related to\nthe practical or technological advances mentioned in the\nparenthetical. But the language is to the contrary. The\noperative standard is \u201crevise as necessary,\u201d with the\nparenthetical pointing to a non-exhaustive list of\n\f                                17\nconsiderations. Unlike other of EPA\u2019s statutory mandates,\nsection 112(d)(6) does not state only that EPA \u201cshall take into\naccount\u201d listed factors, id. \u00a7 11002(a)(4) (EPA\u2019s authority to\nrevise lists of toxic chemicals), or that listed others shall not be\ntaken into account, id. \u00a7 7473(c)(1) (concentrations of\npollutants EPA must ignore). Instead, EPA must revise its\nemission standards \u201cas necessary,\u201d while \u201ctaking into account\u201d\ncertain factors.\n\n     To complete a defined task while taking certain factors\ninto account means to be aware of or consider the factors, not\nto treat them as the exclusive determinants. For example,\nnobody would understand a school principal\u2019s instructions to a\nteacher revising lesson plans \u201cas necessary (taking into account\navailable textbooks and online enrichment programs)\u201d as\nconfining the teacher\u2019s planning to those criteria, to the\nexclusion of the school district\u2019s or state\u2019s comprehensive\ngrade-level curricular requirements. No reasonable reader of\nthe principal\u2019s instruction would think that it would render\noptional (let alone prohibited) the teacher\u2019s revisions to adhere\nto baseline curricular mandates. Dictionaries confirm that\ncommonsense understanding. The Oxford English Dictionary,\nfor example, defines \u201cto take into account\u201d as \u201cto take into\nconsideration as an existing element, to notice.\u201d Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary (2d ed. 1989). And Merriam-Webster\u2019s\ndescribes to \u201ctake into account\u201d as \u201cto make allowance for.\u201d\nTake,         Merriam-Webster          Dictionary         Online,\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/take (last visited\nApril 10, 2020). In its periodic reviews of emission standards,\nEPA must consider practical and technological advances, but\nsection 112(d)(6)\u2019s parenthetical specification does not\nundercut EPA\u2019s obligation to \u201crevise\u201d an emission standard \u201cas\nnecessary\u201d to bring it into compliance with the Act\u2019s own\ndefinition in section 112(d)(1)-(3) of a minimally adequate\n\u201cemission standard.\u201d\n\f                               18\n     EPA claims that its reading of section 112(d)(6) review as\nconfined to consideration of \u201cdevelopments in practices,\nprocesses, and control technologies\u201d finds support from our\n2015 decision in Surface Finishing, but EPA correctly\nconcedes that \u201cSurface Finishing and the precedent it follows\nare not directly on point.\u201d EPA Br. 26. In Surface Finishing,\nwe examined whether EPA\u2019s section 112(d)(6) review of a\nstandard that already imposed MACT limits must ignore those\nlimits and proceed as if EPA were promulgating new ones from\nscratch. See id. at 7-9. We held that section 112(d)(6)\npermitted EPA to respond to intervening developments by\nadjusting existing limits on toxics already subject to emission\nstandards without recalculating MACT floors for those toxics.\nSee id. at 8. Here, we address not a recalculation of existing\nlimits within a source standard, but whether the Act\nnecessitates revising source standards to include for the first\ntime MACT limits for many of the hazardous air pollutants the\nsource category emits. The section 112(d)(6) requirement that\nEPA, when it undertakes its eight-year review, revise emission\nstandards \u201cas necessary\u201d means that EPA must conform them\nto the basic requisites of \u201cemission standards\u201d under section\n112, including by setting controls on previously unaddressed\nhazardous air pollutants.\n\n     EPA and Intervenor\u2019s readings not only contravene the\ntext of section 112(d)(6), but effectively would deprive of\npractical effect the Act\u2019s specified processes for adding to or\nsubtracting from the statutory list of hazardous air pollutants,\nand its direction to EPA to act within 18 months on a petition\nto modify the list. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(3)(A). The point of\nprompt action to update the air toxics list is to ensure that\nemission standards timely reflect new information about\nhazards. Under EPA and Intervenor\u2019s readings of section\n112(d)(6), however, after the requisite swift action to list a new\npollutant or to remove a substance that need not be controlled,\n\f                               19\nthe Agency could choose to ignore it indefinitely, even as EPA\nupdates other features of standards governing the very source\ncategories known to emit it. Such a result would contravene\nCongress\u2019 intent.\n\n     The statutory text alone suffices to resolve this petition,\nbut we note that Petitioners\u2019 reading of section 112(d)(6) is also\nthe only reading that comports with the Act\u2019s overall structure\nand purpose. A principal focus of the 1990 Clean Air Act\nAmendments was to hasten EPA\u2019s regulation of hazardous air\npollutants. As already discussed, Congress in the 1990\nAmendments specified a series of ambitious deadlines for EPA\nto promulgate emission standards within a decade\u2014and with a\nseries of intermediate deadlines\u2014for all sources of hazardous\nair pollutants. It also set a two-year deadline for EPA to\npromulgate emission standards from scratch for any newly\nlisted source category. Id. \u00a7 7412(c)(5). And it required\ncompliance with emission standards \u201cas expeditiously as\npracticable, but in no event later than three years after the\neffective date of such standard.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7412(i)(3)(A). Section\n112(d)(6) review is the sole periodic, ongoing review of\nemission standards the Act requires. Out of line with\nCongress\u2019s temporal vigilance to compel EPA\u2019s prompt\npromulgation of standards for every source category to limit\neach air toxic it emits, EPA\u2019s reading of the Act to allow but\nnot require the Agency to address previously uncontrolled air\ntoxics during a scheduled section 112(d)(6) review implausibly\nleaves no statutory prompt for the completion of statutorily\ndeficient controls.\n\n     Intervenor, for its part, denies even EPA\u2019s claimed\nauthority to opt, in its discretion, to use the occasion of a\nsection 112(d)(6) review to add unlawfully omitted controls on\nlisted air toxics to a source category\u2019s existing emission\nstandard. That reading makes no sense. Intervenor does not\n\f                               20\ndeny that EPA has authority separately to promulgate new rules\nto set the missing emission limits for regulated sources. See id.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(1). Even assuming EPA\u2019s reading of section\n112(d)(6) were correct, Intervenor points to nothing in the Act\nthat would prevent EPA from opting to promulgate the missing\nlimits together with a section 112(d)(6) review. Indeed, the\npractical efficiency of fewer rulemakings addressing the same\nsource category\u2019s emission standard further supports\nPetitioners\u2019 reading. Congress cannot have intended to require\nthat the Agency, the regulated community, and interested\nmembers of the public engage piecemeal with rulemakings\namending the same emission standard under section 112(d)(2)-\n(3) and, separately, under section 112(d)(6). This is further\nconfirmation that the Act is best read to require any\nunderinclusive emission standards be \u201crevised\u201d as \u201cnecessary\u201d\nto comply with section 112(d)(2)-(3) during the eight-yearly\nreview set by section 112(d)(6).\n\n     EPA\u2019s indefinite deferral of its obligation to address pulp\nmill combustion sources\u2019 unregulated hazardous air pollutants\nis not excused by what it now describes as \u201cthe compressed\nschedule for this rulemaking\u201d set by the Northern District of\nCalifornia in Sierra Club v. McCarthy. 2017 Rule, 82 Fed.\nReg. at 47,335. As far back as 2011, EPA had already received\nfull responses from all the pulp and paper manufacturers it\nqueried through its Information Collection Request. EPA\nrepresented to the district court in 2015 that it had gathered the\nneeded information and completed \u201ca detailed modeling file of\nthe emissions that occur in each source category\u201d for pulp mill\ncombustion sources. Sierra Club, 2016 WL 1055120, at *5.\nThe district court nonetheless gave it until October 1, 2017\u2014\nan additional year and a half after that court\u2019s March 2016\ndecision\u2014to complete its section 112(d)(6) review. The\nadequacy of that timeframe is underscored by EPA\u2019s failure to\nobject or, even later, seek additional time to complete the\n\f                               21\nrevision. And it appears generous indeed against the backdrop\nof Congress\u2019 determination in the 1990 Clean Air Act\nAmendments that two years was enough time for EPA to\ncollect information and promulgate from scratch standards for\n40 categories and subcategories of sources to control almost\n200 air toxics they emitted. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(e)(1)(A).\nNow\u2014almost twenty years after the final statutory deadline for\nsetting emission standards for all hazardous air pollutants\nemitted by all source categories, and ten years since Sierra Club\npetitioned for a rulemaking to limit these pollutants from these\npulp mill combustion sources\u2014EPA has yet to undertake the\nrequisite steps to comply with its statutory obligation to set the\nmissing limits. The text, structure, and purpose of section\n112(d)(6) make clear that Congress placed it as a check against\nwhat could otherwise be perpetual deferral of EPA\u2019s\nacknowledged statutory obligation to control all hazardous air\npollutants. This case confirms the practical wisdom of that\nchoice.\n\n    In order to retain the protection of the existing rule, we\nremand without vacatur. \u201cAlthough the MACT floor standards\nin the [Final] Rule are inadequate to the extent emission\nstandards are not set for all listed HAPs, the rules provide\nprotection from the HAPs for which EPA did establish such\nstandards.\u201d NRDC v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1364, 1375 (D.C. Cir.\n2007).\n\n                           *   *     *\n\n     For the above reasons, we grant the petition for review of\nthe 2017 Rule and remand without vacatur for EPA to set limits\non the remaining hazardous air pollutants emitted by pulp mill\ncombustion sources. We dismiss the petition for review of\nEPA\u2019s denial of reconsideration as moot.\n\n                                                     So ordered.\n\f     SENTELLE, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting: Although\nPetitioners set forth four issues in their brief, as the majority\nrecognizes, this case is controlled by one issue\u2014that is, what\nis the scope and meaning of the review-and-revise requirement\nof section 112(d)(6) of the Clean Air Act. See Maj. Op. 14.\nMore specifically, the question is whether the mandate to\nreview and revise the emission standards refers to the whole\nscheme of regulatory controls required by the Act, thereby\nrequiring EPA to promulgate missing emission standards for\nlisted pollutants during its 112(d)(6) review and revision, or\nonly to those standards that EPA has already promulgated at\nthe time of the review, regardless of whether some listed\npollutants are left unregulated. EPA opted for the latter. The\nmajority treats EPA\u2019s consideration of the statute as not\nreasonable, stating \u201c[b]ecause we conclude that the text of the\nstatute unambiguously supports Petitioners\u2019 reading, we\nresolve the case without resort to any deference to EPA under\nChevron, USA, Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).\u201d Id.\nThis is error.\n\n     When confronted with this type of statutory interpretation\nquestion, the court is constrained by the familiar Chevron\ndoctrine. Under the first prong of Chevron, the court must\ndetermine whether Congress \u201chas directly spoken to the precise\nquestion at issue.\u201d Chevron, USA, Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S.\n837, 842 (1984). In other words, the question under Chevron\u2019s\nfirst prong is whether the plain language yields only one\npossible interpretation or is ambiguous. See id. at 842\u201343.\nWhat a court concludes is the best reading of the statute does\nnot satisfy this first prong of Chevron. Only a conclusion that\nthere is a single possible interpretation of the statute will suffice\nto end the inquiry at step one. If the statute is ambiguous, the\ncourt proceeds to the second prong of Chevron. See Util. Solid\nWaste Activities Grp. v. EPA, 901 F.3d 414, 451 (D.C. Cir.\n2018) (Henderson, J., concurring) (\u201cIf \u2018the reality is that [the\nstatute] is ambiguous,\u2019 it is our duty to declare it so and proceed\n\f                                2\nto the second step of the Chevron analysis.\u201d (quoting AT&T\nCorp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 525 U.S. 366, 395 (1999))). That\ninquiry requires the court to consider whether the agency\u2019s\ninterpretation is reasonable. Chevron, USA, Inc., 467 U.S. at\n843, 845. If it is, the agency prevails. Again, it does not matter\nwhether the court concludes there is a \u201cbetter\u201d interpretation.\nSee Am. Forest & Paper Ass\u2019n v. FERC, 550 F.3d 1179, 1183\n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (\u201cStep two of Chevron does not require the\nbest interpretation, only a reasonable one.\u201d).\n\n    In this case, the statute does not directly address the precise\nquestion at issue. As the agency explains, the term \u201cemission\nstandards,\u201d despite its susceptibility to being understood as\nsource specific in section 112(d)(1), is statutorily defined in the\nAct to refer to toxic-specific, not source-specific, standards.\nEPA Br. at 28\u201329. For example, another section of the Act\ndefines the term \u201cemission standards\u201d as \u201ca requirement . . .\nwhich limits the quantity, rate, or concentration of emissions of\nair pollutants on a continuous basis, including any\nrequirements relating to the operation or maintenance of a\nsource to assure continuous emission reduction, and any\ndesign, equipment, work practice or operational standard\npromulgated under [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(k). The\nmajority concludes that this \u201cgenerally applicable definition\u201d\n\u201cdo[es] not support [EPA\u2019s] contention that an emission\nstandard is a limit on an individual pollutant, as opposed to a\nregulation governing the set of pollutants emitted by a source\ncategory.\u201d See Maj. Op. 15. But, in concluding so, the\nmajority misses the point. The point is that this definition\nhighlights that the Act is relatively unclear about what the term\n\u201cemission standards\u201d means. True, in context, section 112(d)\nmight be understood to refer to \u201cemission standards\u201d as the\nwhole collection of standards regulating the emission of\npollutants by a particular category as the majority suggests.\nBut because the generally applicable definition appears to\n\f                                 3\ndefine \u201cemission standards\u201d as toxic-specific standards\ndetached from any particular source category, I cannot\nconclude that section 112(d) unambiguously forecloses EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation.\n\n     Further, although the majority characterizes the reference\nto \u201cemission standards\u201d in section 112(d)(1) as a statutory\ndefinition of the term, see Maj. Op. 15, that particular provision\ndoes not contain any explicit definitions at all. In fact, section\n112(a) contains definitions specific to that section, but it does\nnot include \u201cemission standards\u201d among them. Moreover,\nsection 112(d)(6) is explicitly aimed towards addressing\ndevelopments in technology that have occurred in the eight\nyears since the emission standards were promulgated or last\nreviewed and revised. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). Unlike the\nmajority, I conclude that, while section 112(d)(6) does not\nclearly restrict EPA from addressing missing emission limits\nduring its review and revision, it also does not clearly require\nEPA to promulgate such missing limits at that time.\n\n     In its effort to adopt what it views as the best interpretation\nof the statute, the majority ignores this ambiguity and the\nresultant duty to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. That said,\nthe statute is capable of being understood as the Petitioners and\nthe majority interpret it. Indeed, the fact that the statute is\nsusceptible to both interpretations is precisely why we must\ndefer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. To be sure, were I not\nconstrained by Chevron, I might agree with the majority\u2019s\ninterpretation. Under Chevron, however, even were I to agree\nthat the majority\u2019s interpretation is \u201cbetter,\u201d that does not\nmatter. To survive review under the Chevron standard, an\nagency\u2019s decision needs only to be reasonable. EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation is eminently reasonable. As EPA stated, the\nterms review and revise more naturally refer to something that\ndoes exist rather than something that should exist. EPA Br. at\n\f                              4\n20. Moreover, the same statutory usages of the phrase\n\u201cemission standards\u201d discussed above underline not only the\nambiguity of the statute but the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s\ninterpretation. Accordingly, I would uphold EPA\u2019s action in\nthis case as required under Chevron.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued December 4, 2019               Decided April 21, 2020\n\n                        No. 17-1257\n\n   LOUISIANA ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION NETWORK, ET AL.,\n                    PETITIONERS\n\n                              v.\n\n    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND ANDREW\n     WHEELER, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL\n                PROTECTION AGENCY,\n                    RESPONDENTS\n\n         AMERICAN FOREST & PAPER ASSOCIATION,\n                     INTERVENOR\n\n\n                 Consolidated with 18-1245\n\n\n       On Petitions for Review of Final Action by the\n       United States Environmental Protection Agency\n\n\n     James S.

The problem here is that in\npromulgating the emission standard for pulp mill combustion\nsources in 2001 EPA addressed some but not all the hazardous\nair pollutants they are known to emit. See Final Rule: National\nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical\n\f                                3\nRecovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and\nStand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills, 66 Fed. Reg. 3,180\n(Jan. 12, 2001) (2001 Rule) (codified at 40 C.F.R. pt. 63, subpt.\nMM).\n\n     In the past when EPA left out requisite limits from a source\ncategory\u2019s emission standard, it has acted during its\ncongressionally mandated periodic review of that standard\nunder section 112(d)(6) to revise it to include the necessary\nlimits. The Act requires EPA every eight years to \u201creview, and\nrevise as necessary\u201d each of the \u201cemission standards\u201d it has\npromulgated under section 112\u2014and to do so \u201ctaking into\naccount developments in practices, processes, and control\ntechnologies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). In 2017, EPA\n(belatedly) conducted its first section 112(d)(6) review and\nrevision of the 2001 pulp mill combustion source emission\nstandard, but this time it decided to review only the standard\u2019s\nlimits on emissions of the toxics the standard already\ncontrolled, leaving unlimited several other hazardous toxics\nthat the sources are known to emit but that were left out of the\n2001 Rule. See Final Rule: National Emission Standards for\nHazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical Recovery Combustion\nSources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical\nPulp Mills, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,238 (Oct. 11, 2017) (2017 Rule).\n\n     The parties here dispute whether it was \u201cnecessary\u201d under\nsection 112(d)(6) for EPA to calculate the missing emission\nlimits and \u201crevise\u201d the incomplete \u201cemission standard\u201d\npromulgated in 2001 to include them.                Environmental\npetitioners challenge as both contrary to law and arbitrary the\n2017 Rule\u2019s failure to correct the standard\u2019s acknowledged\nunder-inclusiveness during the section 112(d)(6) review. EPA\nagrees that the Act requires it to set controls in accordance with\nthe method described in section 112(d)(2)-(3) for every air\ntoxic a source category emits. As counsel for EPA put it at oral\n\f                               4\nargument, \u201c[t]his case is not about whether EPA has an\nobligation to set emission standards for each and every [air\ntoxic] from a source category: It does. National Lime in 2000\nestablished that.\u201d Oral Arg. Rec. at 17:53-18:08. But EPA\ncontends that section 112(d)(6) is unambiguous in confining\nthe requisite periodic review to whatever pollutants an existing\nstandard already controls, and \u201ccreates no obligation for EPA\u201d\nto consider any \u201cpollutants not previously addressed.\u201d EPA\nBr. 2. EPA thinks Congress left the Agency to decide when to\nfinish the job: In EPA\u2019s view, it may but is not required to\naddress during section 112(d)(6) review any listed but still\nuncontrolled hazardous air pollutants the source category\nemits. And the Agency says it decided not to do so here\nbecause of time constraints that, it claims, left it with\ninadequate information to calibrate the limits. Intervenor\nAmerican Forest and Paper Association takes a more restrictive\nview of EPA\u2019s authority, insisting that, to protect industry\u2019s\nentitlement to repose, any challenge to the standard\u2019s under-\ninclusiveness of listed air toxics should have been brought\nwithin 60 days after the 2001 Rule. See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Petitioners respond that they have timely raised\na meritorious challenge to EPA\u2019s 2017 Rule. Petitioners also\nchallenge EPA\u2019s denial of their petition for reconsideration,\ncontending that EPA\u2019s central rationale\u2014that it lacked time to\npromulgate the missing limits, and had no legal obligation to\ndo so during its section 112(d)(6) review\u2014appeared for the\nfirst time in the Final Rule, depriving the public of an\nopportunity to comment.\n\n     We hold that, because the Act necessitates section 112-\ncompliant emission standards for each source category, and\nsection 112(d)(6) requires EPA at least every eight years to\nreview and revise emission standards \u201cas necessary,\u201d EPA\u2019s\nsection 112(d)(6) review of a source category\u2019s emission\nstandard must address all listed air toxics the source category\n\f                                5\nemits. The 2017 Rule failed to do so. We accordingly grant\nthe petition and remand the 2017 Rule without vacatur, and\ndirect EPA to set limits on the listed air toxics that pulp mill\ncombustion sources are known to emit but that EPA has yet to\ncontrol. In light of the remand, we dismiss as moot the denial\nof the petition for reconsideration.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     A.

EPA\u2019s Duty Periodically to Revise Major Sources\u2019\n        Emission Standards as Necessary Requires\n        Adding Missing Limits on Air Toxics the Source\n        Emits\n\n     Section 112(d)(6) is the statutory mechanism for\nreviewing and updating emission standards applicable to listed\nsources. It requires that, no less often than every eight years,\nEPA \u201cshall review, and revise as necessary (taking into account\ndevelopments in practices, processes, and control\ntechnologies), emission standards promulgated under this\nsection.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). The question here is\nwhether, when EPA undertakes those updates, it must add\nlimits, calculated consistent with section 112(d)(2)-(3), for any\nair toxics the source emits that the existing standard does not\naddress. In past section 112(d)(6) reviews of other sources\u2019\nemission standards, EPA has updated the standards to include\nlimits for hazardous air pollutants that the sources emit but the\nAgency had not previously limited. See, e.g., Final Rule:\nNational Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for\nMineral Wool Production and Wool Fiberglass Manufacturing,\n80 Fed. Reg. 45,280, 45,311 (July 29, 2015); Final Rule:\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant\nEmissions: Hard and Decorative Chromium Electroplating and\nChromium Anodizing Tanks, 77 Fed. Reg. 58,220, 58,238\n(Sept. 19, 2012). At oral argument both Petitioners and EPA\nrepresented that EPA had previously always updated its\nstandards to set limits on unregulated air toxics in the course of\nits section 112(d)(6) review.

EPA later identified\n\f                               14\nthree section 112(d)(6) reviews during which it did not set\nlimits on previously unaddressed air toxics. See EPA 28(j)\nLetter (Dec. 10, 2019) (citing 80 Fed. Reg. 75,178 (Dec. 1,\n2015); 77 Fed. Reg. 55,698 (Sept. 11, 2012); 76 Fed. Reg.\n70,834 (Nov. 15, 2011)); see also Pet\u2019rs 28(j) Response (Dec.\n17, 2019) (not disputing EPA\u2019s characterization). EPA argued\nhere that its past practice of adding missing limits during\nsection 112(d)(6) review was optional, and that the Act grants\nit discretion whether or not to bring underinclusive standards\ninto compliance with section 112(d)(2)-(3) when conducting its\nperiodic section 112(d)(6) review.\n\n     There is no dispute that the Act requires EPA to have in\nplace emission standards to control all the listed pollutants that\na source category emits, and requires the Agency to revise\nexisting standards that are underinclusive to add section\n112(d)(2)-(3) controls for listed but unaddressed pollutants.\nThe only question is whether EPA lawfully may complete a\nsection 112(d)(6) review and \u201crevise\u201d an existing,\nunderinclusive emission standard \u201cas necessary\u201d without\nsupplying the missing controls. Put differently, the issue is\nwhether section 112(d)(6)\u2019s periodic, mandatory review and\nrevision \u201cas necessary\u201d is textually confined to those air toxics\nalready limited under the source\u2019s existing emission standard,\nor whether that provision compels consideration of the\nadequacy of the emission standard to control all the air toxics\nthe source category emits.\n\n     We read the statutory text to require EPA during its section\n112(d)(6) review to establish any missing limits. Because we\nconclude that the text of the statute unambiguously supports\nPetitioners\u2019 reading, we resolve the case without resort to any\ndeference to EPA under Chevron, USA, Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1984).\n\f                                15\n     Two key features of the statutory language make clear that\nEPA\u2019s duty periodically to review and revise existing standards\nunder section 112(d) encompasses a mandate to add missing\nlimits:\n\n     First, the \u201cstandards\u201d to which section 112(d)(6) refers\u2014\nthe \u201cemission standards promulgated under this subsection\u201d\u2014\nare statutorily defined as comprehensive controls for each\nsource category that must include limits on each hazardous air\npollutant the category emits. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1)-(3),\n(6). The statutory definitions EPA points to do not support its\ncontention that an emission standard is a limit on an individual\npollutant, as opposed to a regulation governing the set of\npollutants emitted by a source category. The Act\u2019s \u201cgenerally\napplicable definition,\u201d EPA Br. 5, describes an emission\nstandard as governing \u201cemissions\u201d of \u201cpollutants\u201d plural,\nspecifically, \u201ca requirement . . . which limits the quantity, rate,\nor concentration of emissions of air pollutants,\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 7602(k).\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">The regulatory definition it says is \u201c[m]ore particular to the\nAct\u2019s hazardous air pollutant program,\u201d EPA Br. 5, merely\nrefers back to a \u201cnational standard . . . promulgated in a subpart\nof this part pursuant to sections 112(d), 112(h), or 112(f) of the\nAct,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.2. And, in calling for \u201cemission standards\nfor each category or subcategory of major sources of hazardous\nair pollutants listed for regulation,\u201d section 112(d) defines air\npollution \u201cemission standards\u201d as source-specific, not toxic-\nspecific. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1). Accordingly, as used in\nsection 112(d), an emission standard includes as many limits as\nneeded to control all the emitted air toxics of a particular source\ncategory.\n\n    EPA also urges that what counts as an emission standard\n\u201cpromulgated\u201d under section 112 is frozen once EPA\ncompletes its initial promulgation, meaning that section\n112(d)(6)\u2019s reference to an \u201cemission standard[] promulgated\u201d\n\f                              16\nunder section 112 would reach only the subset of air toxics a\nsource\u2019s existing standard addressed.           But \u201cemission\nstandards\u201d under section 112(d)(6) are not constrained by past,\npotentially flawed and underinclusive agency action, as EPA\nnow suggests.       Congress\u2019 requirement that EPA must\nperiodically review and revise as necessary its \u201cemission\nstandards\u201d is a mandate to address the adequacy of each\nemission standard on the books against the statutory demand of\nsection 112(d)(2) for an \u201cemission standard\u201d for each source\ncategory\u2014one with the requisite degree of control of all of the\nair toxics the source emits. The obligatory periodic review and\nrevision of \u201cemission standards\u201d thus must ensure that each\nsource category\u2019s standard imposes appropriate limits\u2014not\njust on whatever subset of toxics the existing standard\naddressed, but on all the toxics the source category emits.\n\n     The second textual reason to read section 112(d)(6) to\nrequire EPA to add missing controls is the subsection\u2019s\nmandate to \u201crevise\u201d emission standards \u201cas necessary.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). Again, the core demand of section 112 is\nthat EPA promulgate emission standards for every source\ncategory addressing all listed hazardous air pollutants. And\nCongress established deadlines to make clear that time is of the\nessence. We conclude that when EPA reviews an existing\nstandard that fails to address many of the listed air toxics the\nsource category emits, adding limits for those overlooked\ntoxics is a \u201cnecessary\u201d revision under section 112(d)(6).\n\n     EPA asks us to read the statutory phrase\u2014\u201cas necessary\n(taking into account developments in practices, processes, and\ncontrol technologies),\u201d id.\u2014to require only changes related to\nthe practical or technological advances mentioned in the\nparenthetical. But the language is to the contrary. The\noperative standard is \u201crevise as necessary,\u201d with the\nparenthetical pointing to a non-exhaustive list of\n\f                                17\nconsiderations. Unlike other of EPA\u2019s statutory mandates,\nsection 112(d)(6) does not state only that EPA \u201cshall take into\naccount\u201d listed factors,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 11002(a)(4) </span><pre class=\"inline\">(EPA\u2019s authority to\nrevise lists of toxic chemicals), or that listed others shall not be\ntaken into account,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 7473(c)(1) </span><pre class=\"inline\">(concentrations of\npollutants EPA must ignore). Instead, EPA must revise its\nemission standards \u201cas necessary,\u201d while \u201ctaking into account\u201d\ncertain factors.\n\n     To complete a defined task while taking certain factors\ninto account means to be aware of or consider the factors, not\nto treat them as the exclusive determinants. For example,\nnobody would understand a school principal\u2019s instructions to a\nteacher revising lesson plans \u201cas necessary (taking into account\navailable textbooks and online enrichment programs)\u201d as\nconfining the teacher\u2019s planning to those criteria, to the\nexclusion of the school district\u2019s or state\u2019s comprehensive\ngrade-level curricular requirements. No reasonable reader of\nthe principal\u2019s instruction would think that it would render\noptional (let alone prohibited) the teacher\u2019s revisions to adhere\nto baseline curricular mandates. Dictionaries confirm that\ncommonsense understanding.

In its periodic reviews of emission standards,\nEPA must consider practical and technological advances, but\nsection 112(d)(6)\u2019s parenthetical specification does not\nundercut EPA\u2019s obligation to \u201crevise\u201d an emission standard \u201cas\nnecessary\u201d to bring it into compliance with the Act\u2019s own\ndefinition in section 112(d)(1)-(3) of a minimally adequate\n\u201cemission standard.\u201d\n\f                               18\n     EPA claims that its reading of section 112(d)(6) review as\nconfined to consideration of \u201cdevelopments in practices,\nprocesses, and control technologies\u201d finds support from our\n2015 decision in Surface Finishing, but EPA correctly\nconcedes that \u201cSurface Finishing and the precedent it follows\nare not directly on point.\u201d EPA Br. 26. In Surface Finishing,\nwe examined whether EPA\u2019s section 112(d)(6) review of a\nstandard that already imposed MACT limits must ignore those\nlimits and proceed as if EPA were promulgating new ones from\nscratch. See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 7-9. </span><pre class=\"inline\">We held that section 112(d)(6)\npermitted EPA to respond to intervening developments by\nadjusting existing limits on toxics already subject to emission\nstandards without recalculating MACT floors for those toxics.\nSee</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 8. </span><pre class=\"inline\">Here, we address not a recalculation of existing\nlimits within a source standard, but whether the Act\nnecessitates revising source standards to include for the first\ntime MACT limits for many of the hazardous air pollutants the\nsource category emits. The section 112(d)(6) requirement that\nEPA, when it undertakes its eight-year review, revise emission\nstandards \u201cas necessary\u201d means that EPA must conform them\nto the basic requisites of \u201cemission standards\u201d under section\n112, including by setting controls on previously unaddressed\nhazardous air pollutants.\n\n     EPA and Intervenor\u2019s readings not only contravene the\ntext of section 112(d)(6), but effectively would deprive of\npractical effect the Act\u2019s specified processes for adding to or\nsubtracting from the statutory list of hazardous air pollutants,\nand its direction to EPA to act within 18 months on a petition\nto modify the list. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(3)(A). The point of\nprompt action to update the air toxics list is to ensure that\nemission standards timely reflect new information about\nhazards. Under EPA and Intervenor\u2019s readings of section\n112(d)(6), however, after the requisite swift action to list a new\npollutant or to remove a substance that need not be controlled,\n\f                               19\nthe Agency could choose to ignore it indefinitely, even as EPA\nupdates other features of standards governing the very source\ncategories known to emit it. Such a result would contravene\nCongress\u2019 intent.\n\n     The statutory text alone suffices to resolve this petition,\nbut we note that Petitioners\u2019 reading of section 112(d)(6) is also\nthe only reading that comports with the Act\u2019s overall structure\nand purpose. A principal focus of the 1990 Clean Air Act\nAmendments was to hasten EPA\u2019s regulation of hazardous air\npollutants. As already discussed, Congress in the 1990\nAmendments specified a series of ambitious deadlines for EPA\nto promulgate emission standards within a decade\u2014and with a\nseries of intermediate deadlines\u2014for all sources of hazardous\nair pollutants. It also set a two-year deadline for EPA to\npromulgate emission standards from scratch for any newly\nlisted source category.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> \u00a7 7412(c)(5). </span><pre class=\"inline\">And it required\ncompliance with emission standards \u201cas expeditiously as\npracticable, but in no event later than three years after the\neffective date of such standard.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> \u00a7 7412(i)(3)(A). </span><pre class=\"inline\">Section\n112(d)(6) review is the sole periodic, ongoing review of\nemission standards the Act requires. Out of line with\nCongress\u2019s temporal vigilance to compel EPA\u2019s prompt\npromulgation of standards for every source category to limit\neach air toxic it emits, EPA\u2019s reading of the Act to allow but\nnot require the Agency to address previously uncontrolled air\ntoxics during a scheduled section 112(d)(6) review implausibly\nleaves no statutory prompt for the completion of statutorily\ndeficient controls.\n\n     Intervenor, for its part, denies even EPA\u2019s claimed\nauthority to opt, in its discretion, to use the occasion of a\nsection 112(d)(6) review to add unlawfully omitted controls on\nlisted air toxics to a source category\u2019s existing emission\nstandard. That reading makes no sense. Intervenor does not\n\f                               20\ndeny that EPA has authority separately to promulgate new rules\nto set the missing emission limits for regulated sources. See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span></span>\n\u00a7 7412(d)(1). </span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">Even assuming EPA\u2019s reading of section\n112(d)(6) were correct, Intervenor points to nothing in the Act\nthat would prevent EPA from opting to promulgate the missing\nlimits together with a section 112(d)(6) review. Indeed, the\npractical efficiency of fewer rulemakings addressing the same\nsource category\u2019s emission standard further supports\nPetitioners\u2019 reading. Congress cannot have intended to require\nthat the Agency, the regulated community, and interested\nmembers of the public engage piecemeal with rulemakings\namending the same emission standard under section 112(d)(2)-\n(3) and, separately, under section 112(d)(6). This is further\nconfirmation that the Act is best read to require any\nunderinclusive emission standards be \u201crevised\u201d as \u201cnecessary\u201d\nto comply with section 112(d)(2)-(3) during the eight-yearly\nreview set by section 112(d)(6).\n\n     EPA\u2019s indefinite deferral of its obligation to address pulp\nmill combustion sources\u2019 unregulated hazardous air pollutants\nis not excused by what it now describes as \u201cthe compressed\nschedule for this rulemaking\u201d set by the Northern District of\nCalifornia in Sierra Club v. McCarthy. 2017 Rule, 82 Fed.\nReg. at 47,335. As far back as 2011, EPA had already received\nfull responses from all the pulp and paper manufacturers it\nqueried through its Information Collection Request. EPA\nrepresented to the district court in 2015 that it had gathered the\nneeded information and completed \u201ca detailed modeling file of\nthe emissions that occur in each source category\u201d for pulp mill\ncombustion sources. Sierra Club, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1055120</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.\nThe district court nonetheless gave it until October 1, 2017\u2014\nan additional year and a half after that court\u2019s March 2016\ndecision\u2014to complete its section 112(d)(6) review. The\nadequacy of that timeframe is underscored by EPA\u2019s failure to\nobject or, even later, seek additional time to complete the\n\f                               21\nrevision. And it appears generous indeed against the backdrop\nof Congress\u2019 determination in the 1990 Clean Air Act\nAmendments that two years was enough time for EPA to\ncollect information and promulgate from scratch standards for\n40 categories and subcategories of sources to control almost\n200 air toxics they emitted. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(e)(1)(A).\nNow\u2014almost twenty years after the final statutory deadline for\nsetting emission standards for all hazardous air pollutants\nemitted by all source categories, and ten years since Sierra Club\npetitioned for a rulemaking to limit these pollutants from these\npulp mill combustion sources\u2014EPA has yet to undertake the\nrequisite steps to comply with its statutory obligation to set the\nmissing limits. The text, structure, and purpose of section\n112(d)(6) make clear that Congress placed it as a check against\nwhat could otherwise be perpetual deferral of EPA\u2019s\nacknowledged statutory obligation to control all hazardous air\npollutants. This case confirms the practical wisdom of that\nchoice.\n\n    In order to retain the protection of the existing rule, we\nremand without vacatur. \u201cAlthough the MACT floor standards\nin the [Final] Rule are inadequate to the extent emission\nstandards are not set for all listed HAPs, the rules provide\nprotection from the HAPs for which EPA did establish such\nstandards.\u201d NRDC v.

See Maj. Op. 14.\nMore specifically, the question is whether the mandate to\nreview and revise the emission standards refers to the whole\nscheme of regulatory controls required by the Act, thereby\nrequiring EPA to promulgate missing emission standards for\nlisted pollutants during its 112(d)(6) review and revision, or\nonly to those standards that EPA has already promulgated at\nthe time of the review, regardless of whether some listed\npollutants are left unregulated. EPA opted for the latter. The\nmajority treats EPA\u2019s consideration of the statute as not\nreasonable, stating \u201c[b]ecause we conclude that the text of the\nstatute unambiguously supports Petitioners\u2019 reading, we\nresolve the case without resort to any deference to EPA under\nChevron, USA, Inc. v.

If it is, the agency prevails. Again, it does not matter\nwhether the court concludes there is a \u201cbetter\u201d interpretation.\nSee Am. Forest & Paper Ass\u2019n v.

Cir. 2008) (\u201cStep two of Chevron does not require the\nbest interpretation, only a reasonable one.\u201d).\n\n    In this case, the statute does not directly address the precise\nquestion at issue. As the agency explains, the term \u201cemission\nstandards,\u201d despite its susceptibility to being understood as\nsource specific in section 112(d)(1), is statutorily defined in the\nAct to refer to toxic-specific, not source-specific, standards.\nEPA Br. at 28\u201329. For example, another section of the Act\ndefines the term \u201cemission standards\u201d as \u201ca requirement . . .\nwhich limits the quantity, rate, or concentration of emissions of\nair pollutants on a continuous basis, including any\nrequirements relating to the operation or maintenance of a\nsource to assure continuous emission reduction, and any\ndesign, equipment, work practice or operational standard\npromulgated under [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(k). The\nmajority concludes that this \u201cgenerally applicable definition\u201d\n\u201cdo[es] not support [EPA\u2019s] contention that an emission\nstandard is a limit on an individual pollutant, as opposed to a\nregulation governing the set of pollutants emitted by a source\ncategory.\u201d See Maj. Op. 15. But, in concluding so, the\nmajority misses the point. The point is that this definition\nhighlights that the Act is relatively unclear about what the term\n\u201cemission standards\u201d means. True, in context, section 112(d)\nmight be understood to refer to \u201cemission standards\u201d as the\nwhole collection of standards regulating the emission of\npollutants by a particular category as the majority suggests.\nBut because the generally applicable definition appears to\n\f                                 3\ndefine \u201cemission standards\u201d as toxic-specific standards\ndetached from any particular source category, I cannot\nconclude that section 112(d) unambiguously forecloses EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation.\n\n     Further, although the majority characterizes the reference\nto \u201cemission standards\u201d in section 112(d)(1) as a statutory\ndefinition of the term, see Maj. Op. 15, that particular provision\ndoes not contain any explicit definitions at all. In fact, section\n112(a) contains definitions specific to that section, but it does\nnot include \u201cemission standards\u201d among them. Moreover,\nsection 112(d)(6) is explicitly aimed towards addressing\ndevelopments in technology that have occurred in the eight\nyears since the emission standards were promulgated or last\nreviewed and revised. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6). Unlike the\nmajority, I conclude that, while section 112(d)(6) does not\nclearly restrict EPA from addressing missing emission limits\nduring its review and revision, it also does not clearly require\nEPA to promulgate such missing limits at that time.\n\n     In its effort to adopt what it views as the best interpretation\nof the statute, the majority ignores this ambiguity and the\nresultant duty to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. That said,\nthe statute is capable of being understood as the Petitioners and\nthe majority interpret it. Indeed, the fact that the statute is\nsusceptible to both interpretations is precisely why we must\ndefer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. To be sure, were I not\nconstrained by Chevron, I might agree with the majority\u2019s\ninterpretation. Under Chevron, however, even were I to agree\nthat the majority\u2019s interpretation is \u201cbetter,\u201d that does not\nmatter. To survive review under the Chevron standard, an\nagency\u2019s decision needs only to be reasonable. EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation is eminently reasonable. As EPA stated, the\nterms review and revise more naturally refer to something that\ndoes exist rather than something that should exist. EPA Br. at\n\f                              4\n20. Moreover, the same statutory usages of the phrase\n\u201cemission standards\u201d discussed above underline not only the\nambiguity of the statute but the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s\ninterpretation. Accordingly, I would uphold EPA\u2019s action in\nthis case as required under Chevron.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186945/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186882/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/187266/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186224/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118260/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111221/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/108502/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118329/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/185308/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4527399/", "id": 4527399, "absolute_url": "/opinion/4747052/nicholas-stewart-v-thomas-modly/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/4747052/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "date_created": "2020-04-21T16:00:36.406818Z", "date_modified": "2020-04-21T16:25:14.132780Z", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "4dd68ebdfa0789e27ce07defb5314daa32720573", "page_count": 6, "download_url": "https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/186D346A2EE08D828525855100529F78/$file/18-5370-1839017.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2020/04/21/nicholas_stewart_v._thomas_modly.pdf", "plain_text": " United States Court of Appeals\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued March 2, 2020                   Decided April 21, 2020\n\n                         No. 18-5370\n\n NICHOLAS S.

See Letter from\nRay Mabus, Secretary of the Navy, to Deputy Commandant for\nManpower and Reserve Affairs (Feb. 13, 2015), J.A. 42.\n\n     Stewart challenged the unexplained denial in the district\ncourt, which agreed that the Secretary\u2019s failure to explain was\narbitrary and capricious and remanded the denial to the\nSecretary \u201cfor further consideration and clarification.\u201d\nStewart v. Stackley, 251 F. Supp. 3d 138, 141 (D.D.C. 2017).\nIn response, the Secretary adhered to the initial decision,\nfinding that \u201ca waiver does not meet the needs of the service\u201d\nbecause (1) Stewart \u201cbarely meets the statutory 6-year\nminimum for eligibility,\u201d (2) he \u201chas been consistently ranked\nin the bottom two-thirds of his peer group,\u201d and (3) his\n\u201creviewing officers have evaluated him as performing better\nthan only about 18% of his peers.\u201d Letter from Richard V.\nSpencer, Secretary of the Navy, to Deputy Commandant for\nManpower and Reserve Affairs (Dec. 19, 2017), J.A. 31\u201332.\nThe Secretary rejected the notion that Stewart would have met\nthe flight gate if not for his criminal case, noting that Stewart\nwas out of \u201cflight status\u201d before his unlawful conviction and\nagain after its reversal. Id., J.A. 32.\n\n    Returning to the district court, Stewart argued that the\nSecretary\u2019s denial violated Instruction 7220.87 and that it was\nsubstantively arbitrary and capricious. See Stewart v. Spencer,\n\f                               4\n344 F. Supp. 3d 147, 154\u201358 (D.D.C. 2018). The district court\nrejected Stewart\u2019s claims and entered summary judgment in the\nSecretary\u2019s favor. As to Stewart\u2019s procedural claim, the district\ncourt concluded that none of the Secretary\u2019s actions violated\nInstruction 7220.87 and, in the alternative, that Stewart failed\nto demonstrate prejudice from any alleged procedural\nviolation. Id. at 155. As to his substantive claims, the district\ncourt found that the Secretary\u2019s decision \u201cwas accompanied by\na \u2018reasoned evaluation of the relevant information,\u2019\u201d id. at 156\n(quoting Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490\nU.S. 360, 385 (1989)), and, further, that \u201cit [was] reasonable\nfor the Secretary to have relied on [Stewart\u2019s personnel\nrecords]\u201d in denying the waiver, id. at 158.\n\n     Stewart now appeals. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s\ndecision to grant summary judgment de novo.\u201d Aera Energy\nLLC v. Salazar, 642 F.3d 212, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2011). As Stewart\nacknowledges, our review of the Secretary\u2019s actions is\n\u201c\u2018unusually deferential.\u2019\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 9\u201310 (quoting\nKreis v. Secretary of the Air Force, 866 F.2d 1508, 1514 (D.C.\nCir. 1989)).\n\n     As an initial matter, the government argues that Stewart\u2019s\nchallenge to the waiver denial is unreviewable. See Kreis, 866\nF.2d at 1515 (finding Air Force servicemember\u2019s retroactive-\npromotion claim \u201cnonjusticiable\u201d). We need not address this\nargument insofar as it applies to the substance of the denial,\nhowever, because Stewart has made clear he has abandoned his\nsubstantive challenge. Specifically, in his appellate briefs,\nStewart consistently characterizes his claim as procedural,\nincluding in response to the government\u2019s argument that the\nwaiver denial was \u201c\u2018committed to agency discretion by law.\u2019\u201d\nAppellee\u2019s Br. 19 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2)). At oral\nargument, moreover, Stewart\u2019s counsel confirmed that the sole\nrelief he seeks is to have the waiver-request process \u201cdone\n\f                                5\nright . . . in compliance with the regulation,\u201d not for the court\nto find that the denial was inconsistent with the service\u2019s needs.\nOral Arg. Rec. 23:25\u201330.\n\n     Stewart\u2019s sole remaining claim on appeal, then, is\nprocedural. At oral argument, the government conceded that\nthe question whether the Secretary complied with the process\noutlined in the applicable regulation is judicially reviewable.\nSee id. 21:29\u201332 (\u201c[C]ompliance with the regulation is\nreviewable.\u201d). We may accept the concession because, contrary\nto the government\u2019s brief, see Appellee\u2019s Br. 19 (referring to\n\u201cthese barriers to jurisdiction\u201d), this question of reviewability\nis not jurisdictional, see Sierra Club v. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848,\n854 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (\u201c[A] complaint seeking review of agency\naction \u2018committed to agency discretion by law,\u2019 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 701(a)(2), has failed to state a claim under the\n[Administrative Procedure Act], and therefore should be\ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(6), not under the jurisdictional\nprovision of Rule 12(b)(1).\u201d).\n\n     We therefore proceed to the merits of Stewart\u2019s procedural\nclaim. Stewart argues that, on remand, Instruction 7220.87\nrequired the Secretary to obtain fresh endorsements from\nStewart\u2019s chain of command. We disagree. Nothing in the\nregulation obligates the Secretary to seek updated\nendorsements, and Stewart concedes that the Secretary \u201cfull[y]\ncompli[ed]\u201d with the regulation when Stewart\u2019s waiver\npackage was initially compiled, Reply Br. 7. In the \u201cabsence of\nany specific [judicial] command,\u201d moreover, agencies are\n\u201cgenerally free to determine in [their] discretion whether to\naccept additional evidence\u201d on remand. Butte County v.\nChaudhuri, 887 F.3d 501, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2018); see id. 505\u201306\n(affirming Secretary of Interior\u2019s decision to reopen informal\nadjudication record). In this case, the district court\u2019s remand\norder contained no requirement that the Secretary obtain new\n\f                               6\nendorsements, and Stewart gives us no reason to conclude that\nthe Secretary abused his discretion by relying on the old\nendorsements or by considering Stewart\u2019s performance data.\n\n    To be sure, as Stewart points out, by the time of the\nremand, the signatory to the initial waiver denial, then-\nSecretary Ray Mabus, \u201chad moved on from his Government\nservice.\u201d Reply Br. 12. But, contrary to Stewart\u2019s argument, the\nremand order directed \u201cthe Secretary,\u201d not Mabus personally,\nto provide \u201cfurther consideration and clarification.\u201d Stewart,\n251 F.

In 2017, the EPA Administrator\nissued a directive that now prohibits all grant recipients from\nserving on any agency advisory committee. Three scientists\nwho had previously received EPA grants and served on\nadvisory committees, along with several non-profit\norganizations, filed suit, arguing that the directive was both\narbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\nThe district court granted EPA\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding\nthat the directive was unreviewable and, in the alternative,\nlawful. For the reasons explained below, we reverse.\n\n                               I.\n\n     Several environmental statutes require EPA to ground its\ndecision-making in scientific evidence. The Clean Air Act, for\nexample, mandates that \u201c[a]ir quality criteria . . . accurately\nreflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the\nkind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or\nwelfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7408(a)(2), and the Toxic Substances\nControl Act requires the Administrator to \u201cmake decisions . . .\nbased on the weight of the scientific evidence,\u201d 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2625(i).\n\n     To effectuate these statutory commands and ensure that\n\u201cnational efforts to reduce environmental risks are based on the\nbest available scientific information,\u201d EPA, Our Mission and\nWhat We Do (Feb. 7, 2018), https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/\nour-mission-and-what-we-do, EPA relies on twenty-two\nadvisory committees to provide scientific knowledge relevant\n\f                               4\nto the agency\u2019s statutory objectives. These committees serve a\nrange of functions. Some provide general knowledge across\nscientific domains, such as the Science Advisory Board (SAB)\nwhich offers \u201cscientific advice\u201d to EPA and Congressional\ncommittees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4365(a). Others are tailored to specific\nstatutory mandates. For example, the Federal Insecticide,\nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act requires the Administrator to\nconvene and consult a panel of \u201c7 members appointed by the\nAdministrator from a list of 12 nominees, 6 nominated by the\nNational Institutes of Health and 6 by the National Science\nFoundation,\u201d chosen \u201con the basis of their professional\nqualifications to assess the effects of the impact of pesticides\non health and the environment.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136w(d)(1).\nSimilarly, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to create the Clean\nAir Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), directing the\nAdministrator to appoint \u201cseven members including at least\none member of the National Academy of Sciences, one\nphysician, and one person representing State air pollution\ncontrol agencies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(d)(2)(A). And while\ncommittees may be \u201cadvisory\u201d in name, EPA engagement with\nsuch committees is often mandatory. The statute creating the\nSAB, for example, requires that the Administrator \u201cshall make\navailable\u201d to the Board \u201cany proposed criteria document,\nstandard, limitation, or regulation\u201d created under numerous\nenvironmental statutes and shared with any other agency, id.\n\u00a7 4365(c)(1), and the Clean Air Act requires that when issuing\nnotice of certain proposed rules, EPA must \u201cset forth or\nsummarize\u201d the findings and recommendations of CASAC\nand, \u201cif the proposal differs in any important respect from any\nof these recommendations,\u201d EPA must provide \u201can explanation\nof the reasons for such differences,\u201d id. \u00a7 7607(d)(3).\n\f                               5\n      EPA advisory committees, like others throughout the\nfederal government, are authorized and regulated by the\nFederal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. app. II\n\u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. FACA imposes government-wide procedural\nrequirements on advisory committees, directing them to give\nadvance notice of meetings; hold meetings \u201copen to the\npublic\u201d; allow \u201c[i]nterested persons\u201d to \u201cattend, appear before,\nor file statements\u201d; keep minutes of each meeting and copies of\nall reports received, issued, or approved by the committee; and\nmake committee records publicly available. Id. \u00a7 10(a)\u2013(c).\nThe Act also imposes substantive requirements. Committee\n\u201cmembership,\u201d for example, must be \u201cfairly balanced in terms\nof the points of view represented and the functions to be\nperformed by the advisory committee,\u201d id. \u00a7 5(b)(2), and\nimplementing regulations for such a committee \u201cshall . . .\ncontain appropriate provisions to assure that the [committee\u2019s]\nadvice and recommendations . . . will not be inappropriately\ninfluenced by the appointing authority or by any special\ninterest, but will instead be the result of the advisory\ncommittee\u2019s independent judgment,\u201d id. \u00a7 5(b)(3).\n\n     FACA charges the General Services Administration\n(GSA) with developing government-wide standards for\nconvening advisory committees. In response, GSA has issued\nregulations that largely leave appointments to individual\nagency heads, explaining that \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided by\nstatute, Presidential Directive, or other establishment authority\nadvisory committee members serve at the pleasure of the\nappointing or inviting authority,\u201d and that their \u201c[m]embership\nterms are at the sole discretion of the appointing or inviting\nauthority.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.130(a). But that discretion is not\nboundless. Because advisory committee members are\ngovernment workers\u2014technically \u201cspecial Government\nemployee[s]\u201d who perform temporary duties for the federal\ngovernment for a limited period each year, 18 U.S.C.\n\f                                 6\n\u00a7 202(a)\u2014GSA regulations require that each agency head\n\u201cmust . . . [a]ssure that the interests and affiliations of advisory\ncommittee members are reviewed for conformance with\napplicable conflict of interest statutes . . . and other Federal\nethics rules,\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.105(h). GSA regulations, in\nother words, dictate that advisory committee members, just like\nall other government employees, are bound by federal ethics\nrules.\n\n     The ethics rules at issue in this case have been\npromulgated by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE),\nwhich is responsible for implementing two major ethics\nstatutes. The Ethics in Government Act directs OGE to provide\n\u201coverall direction of executive branch policies related to\npreventing conflicts of interest on the part of officers and\nemployees of any executive agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 402(a).\nAnd the federal conflict-of-interest statute likewise tasks OGE\nwith identifying \u201cthe types of interests that are not so\nsubstantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the\nservices the Government may expect from the employee,\u201d 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 208(d)(2)(B), and with granting class-wide\nexemptions from the ethics rules for certain conduct that is \u201ctoo\nremote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the\nservices of the Government officers or employees,\u201d id.\n\u00a7 208(b)(2).\n\n     Pursuant to these authorities, OGE issued a regulation\nknown as the \u201cStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of\nthe Executive Branch,\u201d which interprets the conflict-of-interest\nstatute and \u201cestablishes uniform standards of ethical conduct\u201d\nfor all executive-branch workers. 57 Fed. Reg. 35,006, 35,006\n(Aug. 7, 1992). These detailed regulations tell government\nemployees precisely when they might or might not have an\nethics problem. And although recognizing that certain ethics\nrules \u201ctailored to the functions and activities of a given agency\u201d\n\f                                7\nmight be appropriate, id., OGE requires that agencies wishing\nto supplement their rules \u201cprepare and submit\u201d any\nsupplemental regulations to OGE \u201cfor its concurrence and joint\nissuance\u201d in the Federal Register, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2635.105(a)\u2013(b).\n\n     Central to this case, OGE has expressly addressed the\nethical responsibilities of \u201cspecial government employees\u201d like\nEPA advisory committee members who receive agency\nfunding. Specifically, a \u201cspecial Government employee\nserving on an advisory committee within the meaning of\n[FACA] may participate in any particular matter of general\napplicability where the disqualifying financial interest arises\nfrom his non-Federal employment or non-Federal prospective\nemployment, provided that the matter will not have a special or\ndistinct effect on the employee or employer other than as part\nof a class.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2640.203(g). The regulations spell out what\nthis rule means in practice. For example, \u201c[a] chemist\nemployed by a major pharmaceutical company . . . developing\nan experimental AIDS vaccine\u201d can ethically serve \u201con an\nadvisory committee established to develop recommendations\nfor new standards for AIDS vaccine trials,\u201d because the\nchemist\u2019s employer \u201cwill be affected by the new standards only\nas part of the class of all pharmaceutical companies and other\nresearch entities that are attempting to develop an AIDS\nvaccine.\u201d Id. By contrast, \u201c[a]n employee of [a] university\u201d that\nreceives grants from the agency \u201cmay not participate in\u201d an\nadvisory committee that focuses on \u201cthe evaluation of th[at]\nuniversity\u2019s performance,\u201d because the evaluation of that\nspecific university\u2019s performance \u201cis not a matter of general\napplicability.\u201d Id. According to OGE, then, grantees may\nethically serve on advisory committees that affect an otherwise\ndisqualifying interest so long as they limit their participation to\ntopics of broad applicability.\n\f                                 8\n    Consistent with OGE\u2019s uniform standards, EPA has long\nallowed individual recipients of EPA grants to serve on its\nscientific advisory committees, provided they do not address\nmatters related to their individual grants. As a 2013 report from\nEPA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General illustrates, the agency\ngenerally \u201cd[id] not consider a prospective or current member\u2019s\nreceipt of an agency or other federal research grant to create the\nbasis for a financial conflict of interest.\u201d Office of the Inspector\nGeneral, EPA, EPA Can Better Document Resolution of Ethics\nand Partiality Concerns in Managing Clean Air Federal\nAdvisory Committees 9\u201310, https://www.epa.gov/sites/\nproduction/files/2015-09/documents/20130911-13-p-0387.pdf\n(2013).\n\n     That changed in October 2017, when then-EPA\nAdministrator Scott Pruitt issued a directive titled\n\u201cStrengthening and Improving Membership on EPA Federal\nAdvisory Committees.\u201d Compl., Ex. A (\u201cthe Directive\u201d). The\nDirective provides that \u201c[i]n order to strengthen and improve\nthe independence, diversity, and breadth of participation on\nEPA federal advisory committees, the Agency shall, consistent\nwith applicable laws and regulations, apply the following\nprinciples and procedures when establishing the membership\nof such committees,\u201d and then lists four principles, only one of\nwhich is at issue here: \u201c[s]trengthen [m]ember\n[i]ndependence.\u201d Id. According to that principle, \u201c[m]embers\nshall be independent from EPA, which shall include a\nrequirement that no member of an EPA federal advisory\ncommittee be currently in receipt of EPA grants, either as\nprincipal investigator or co-investigator[,] or in a position that\notherwise would reap substantial direct benefit from an EPA\ngrant.\u201d Id. Simultaneously, the Administrator issued a\nmemorandum that \u201caccompanie[d] and explain[ed]\u201d the\nprinciples. Compl., Ex. B (\u201cthe Memorandum\u201d). We shall have\nmore to say about that memorandum later in this opinion.\n\f                                9\n     Three      organizations\u2014Physicians      for      Social\nResponsibility, the National Hispanic Medical Association,\nand the International Society for Children\u2019s Health and the\nEnvironment\u2014along with three individuals who have\npreviously received EPA funding and served on advisory\ncommittees (\u201cScientists,\u201d as they describe themselves) sued,\ncontending that the Directive violates the APA. In their\ncomplaint and its accompanying declarations, the Scientists\nallege that many advisory committee members received emails\nasking them to \u201cconfirm\u201d that they received EPA grant\nfunding, and, after doing so, were quickly notified that they\n\u201chad been removed\u201d from their respective committees. Compl.\n\u00b6 60.\n\n     The district court granted EPA\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling\nthat the Scientists failed to state a claim for relief because the\nDirective was committed to agency discretion by law, or, even\nif subject to APA review, was neither arbitrary and capricious\nnor contrary to law. See Physicians for Social Responsibility v.\nWheeler, 359 F. Supp. 3d 27, 35\u201350 (D.D.C. 2019). This appeal\nfollowed. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim de novo,\u201d Harris v.\nDistrict of Columbia Water & Sewer Authority, 791 F.3d 65,\n68 (D.C. Cir. 2015), and \u201c\u2018accept as true all material allegations\nof the complaint,\u2019\u201d Barker v. Conroy, 921 F.3d 1118, 1121\n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting LaRoque v. Holder, 650 F.3d 777,\n785 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). In an appeal from a district court\ndecision reviewing an agency action\u2014as here\u2014\u201cwe review the\nadministrative action directly, according no particular\ndeference to the judgment of the District Court.\u201d Holland v.\nNational Mining Association, 309 F.3d 808, 814 (D.C. Cir.\n2002).\n\f                               10\n                               II.\n\n      At the outset, EPA argues that \u201cthe APA does not allow\nreview of\u201d the Directive. Appellee\u2019s Br. 16. As our court has\nexplained, while \u201c[t]here is a strong presumption of\nreviewability under the Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d\nSteenholdt v. FAA, 314 F.3d 633, 638 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing\nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967)), section\n701(a) expressly precludes judicial review of \u201cagency action\n. . . committed to agency discretion by law,\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 701(a)(2). Regardless of what ground a challenger invokes\nunder the APA, then, \u201cbefore any review at all may be had, a\nparty must first clear the hurdle of \u00a7 701(a).\u201d Heckler v.\nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 828 (1985). That provision imposes two\nrelated, but distinct, barriers to judicial review.\n\n     First, the Supreme Court has \u201cread \u00a7 701(a)(2) to preclude\njudicial review of certain categories of administrative decisions\nthat courts traditionally have regarded as \u2018committed to agency\ndiscretion.\u2019\u201d Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993). As the\nCourt explained in Heckler v. Chaney, this means that\nnotwithstanding the APA\u2019s background presumption of\nreviewability, certain agency actions are \u201cpresumed immune\nfrom judicial review.\u201d 470 U.S. at 832. The paradigmatic\nexample of presumptively unreviewable agency action is \u201ca\ndecision not to institute enforcement proceedings.\u201d\nDepartment of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2568\n(2019) (citing Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831\u201332). Other \u201ckinds of\nadministrative determinations [also] evade review\u201d under\nHeckler\u2019s presumption of non-reviewability, including\n\u201callocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation,\u201d \u201cthe\nFAA\u2019s decision not to renew an aircraft examiner\u2019s authority,\u201d\n\u201can agency\u2019s decision to reach a settlement,\u201d and \u201ca federal\nprosecutor\u2019s certification that there is a substantial federal\ninterest in a case, required to proceed against a juvenile in\n\f                               11\nfederal court.\u201d Secretary of Labor v. Twentymile Coal Co., 456\nF.3d 151, 156 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted).\n\n     Second, as the Court explained in Citizens to Preserve\nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, even if agency action is\npresumptively reviewable, section 701(a)(2) also applies \u201cin\nthose rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad\nterms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u201d 401 U.S.\n402, 410 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). That is, \u201cif the statute is drawn so that a court would\nhave no meaningful standard against which to judge the\nagency\u2019s exercise of discretion,\u201d then there can be no judicial\nreview. Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830. As a result, \u201c[b]oth the\nSupreme Court and this court\u201d have applied section 701(a)(2)\u2019s\nthreshold bar where \u201c\u2018the courts have no legal norms pursuant\nto which to evaluate the challenged action, and thus no concrete\nlimitations to impose on the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u2019\u201d\nTwentymile Coal Co., 456 F.3d at 156 (quoting Drake v. FAA,\n291 F.3d 59, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).\n\n      EPA believes that the Directive is unreviewable under\nboth theories. First, the Directive represents a presumptively\nunreviewable decision traditionally committed to EPA\u2019s\ndiscretion because \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s elaboration of the principles\nit intends to follow, for the purpose of identifying preferred\ncandidates for advising the agency on matters within the\nagency\u2019s purview, directly implicates the agency\u2019s \u2018ordering of\nits [own] priorities\u2019 and its expert policy judgment.\u201d Appellee\u2019s\nBr. 21 (quoting Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193) (alteration in\noriginal). And second, even under a traditional presumption of\nreviewability, there is no \u201claw to apply\u201d because \u201cnone of the\nstatutes governing [EPA\u2019s] committees provides any basis for\nreviewing the merits of the [Directive].\u201d Id. at 22, 38. Whatever\nEPA\u2019s starting point under section 701(a)(2), however, the\nDirective is reviewable.\n\f                               12\n     As our court has explained, regardless of \u201cwhether [a] case\nis governed by Overton Park (\u2018no law to apply\u2019 so the\npresumption of reviewability is lost) or Chaney (agency action\n[where a] presumption of non-reviewability has not been\novercome),\u201d judicial review is available where there are\n\u201cmeaningful standards to cabin the agency\u2019s otherwise plenary\ndiscretion.\u201d Drake, 291 F.3d at 71. And significantly for this\ncase, \u201cjudicially manageable standards \u2018may be found in\nformal and informal policy statements and regulations as well\nas in statutes.\u2019\u201d Steenholdt, 314 F.3d at 638 (quoting Padula v.\nWebster, 822 F.2d 97, 100 (D.C. Cir. 1987)); see also Center\nfor Auto Safety v. Dole, 846 F.2d 1532, 1534 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(\u201c[R]egulations promulgated by an administrative agency in\ncarrying out its statutory mandate can provide standards for\njudicial review of agency action.\u201d).\n\n     GSA\u2019s regulations implementing FACA provide just such\nstandards. Although, as EPA emphasizes, those regulations\nprovide that \u201cadvisory committee members serve at the\npleasure of the appointing or inviting authority\u201d and their\n\u201cterms are at the [authority\u2019s] sole discretion,\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-\n3.130(a), they also require that when appointing such members,\n\u201c[t]he head of each agency . . . must . . . [a]ssure that the\ninterests and affiliations of advisory committee members are\nreviewed for conformance with applicable conflict of interest\nstatutes, regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Government\nEthics (OGE) including any supplemental agency\nrequirements, and other Federal ethics rules,\u201d id. \u00a7 102-\n3.105(h) (emphasis added). Indeed, our court has found\nmeaningful standards to apply \u201cunder far more permissive and\nindeterminate language.\u201d Cody v. Cox, 509 F.3d 606, 610 (D.C.\nCir. 2007). In one case, for example, we found that a statute\nrequiring nothing more than \u201chigh quality and cost-effective\u201d\ncare provided a reviewable standard. Id. at 611. In another, we\nfound \u201claw to apply\u201d in a statute providing that the Army Board\n\f                                  13\nfor Correction of Military Records \u201c\u2018may excuse a failure to\nfile . . . if it finds it to be in the interest of justice.\u2019\u201d Dickson v.\nSecretary of Defense, 68 F.3d 1396, 1398 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\n(emphasis added) (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(b)). Set against\nthis precedent, the mandatory language of GSA\u2019s regulations\u2014\nagency heads \u201cmust . . . assure\u201d compliance with federal ethics\nrules\u2014provides \u201cmeaningful standards for defining the limits\nof [the agency\u2019s] discretion,\u201d giving us \u201c\u2018law to apply\u2019 under\n\u00a7 701(a)(2).\u201d Heckler, 470 U.S. at 834. We therefore turn to the\nmerits of the Scientists\u2019 APA claims.\n\n                                 III.\n\n     The Scientists allege that the Directive runs afoul of the\nAPA in three ways: one, it is contrary to law because EPA has\nno authority to deviate from OGE\u2019s ethics regime; two, it is\narbitrary and capricious because it lacks a reasoned\nexplanation; and three, it is procedurally flawed because EPA\nfailed to submit it to OGE for approval. We address each in\nturn.\n\n                                  A.\n\n     In support of their first claim, the Scientists argue that the\nDirective adopts appointment conditions \u201cinconsistent with the\nuniform and binding ethics standards established by the Ethics\nOffice.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 26. As they see it, because OGE is\ntasked with promulgating uniform standards of conduct for the\nexecutive branch, EPA has no discretion to deviate from\nOGE\u2019s ethics standards; any EPA appointment policy \u201cmust\nprohibit what [OGE] ethics rules prohibit, and allow what the\nrules allow.\u201d Id. at 31.\n\n     The plain text of OGE\u2019s uniform standards dooms the\nScientists\u2019 claim. Those standards expressly acknowledge that\nif an agency \u201cwishes,\u201d it may promulgate supplemental rules\n\f                               14\nthat operate \u201c[i]n addition to the substantive provisions\u201d of\nOGE\u2019s regime. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2635.105(a)(2). And in the Federal\nRegister notice announcing the uniform standards, OGE\nexplained that because agencies may need to \u201ctailor[]\u201d their\nethics rules \u201cto the functions and activities of a given agency,\u201d\nthe uniform standards provide \u201cauthority for individual\nagencies to issue\u201d additional agency-specific rules. Standards\nof Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 57\nFed. Reg. at 35,006. To be sure, as we shall later explain in our\ndiscussion of the Scientists\u2019 procedural challenge, infra at Part\nIII.C, an agency seeking to depart from OGE\u2019s uniform rules\nmay have to comply with OGE\u2019s supplemental-regulation\nprocess. But to the extent the Scientists view the Directive as\nan impermissible deviation from OGE rules, that grievance is\nprocedural, not substantive. The district court therefore\ncorrectly dismissed the Scientists\u2019 claim that the Directive is\ncontrary to law merely because it differs from OGE\u2019s uniform\nstandards.\n\n                               B.\n\n     In support of their claim that EPA\u2019s new policy is arbitrary\nand capricious because it lacks the indicia of a reasoned\ndecision, the Scientists argue that \u201cthe Directive and\nMemorandum evidence no awareness that EPA\u2019s new position\ncontradicts the executive-branch ethics standards\u201d and the\nagency \u201cfailed to rationally address its previous conclusion . . .\nthat EPA grantees can provide objective and unbiased advice\non matters unrelated to their grants.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 47, 52.\nWe agree with the latter point.\n\n     It is axiomatic that the APA requires an agency to explain\nits basis for a decision. We are hardly the first panel to quote\nState Farm\u2019s maxim that \u201cthe agency must examine the\nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its\n\f                                 15\naction.\u201d Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of U.S. v.\nState Farm Mutual Automotive Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983). This foundational precept of administrative law is\nespecially important where, as here, an agency changes course.\nReasoned decision-making requires that when departing from\nprecedents or practices, an agency must \u201coffer a reason to\ndistinguish them or explain its apparent rejection of their\napproach.\u201d Southwest Airlines Co. v. FERC, 926 F.3d 851, 856\n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). To be sure, in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc,\nthe Supreme Court made clear that \u201cState Farm neither held\nnor implied that every agency action representing a policy\nchange must be justified by reasons more substantial than those\nrequired to adopt a policy in the first instance.\u201d 556 U.S. 502,\n514 (2009). But \u201chowever the agency justifies its new position,\nwhat it may not do is \u2018gloss[] over or swerve[] from prior\nprecedents without discussion.\u2019\u201d Southwest Airlines, 926 F.3d\nat 856 (quoting Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 444\nF.2d 841, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1970)).\n\n    Recall that EPA announced its new policy in a single-page\nDirective, along with a memorandum explaining its rationale.\nThe challenged \u201cprinciple\u201d states:\n\n       Strengthen Member Independence: Members shall\n       be independent from EPA, which shall include a\n       requirement that no member of an EPA federal\n       advisory committee be currently in receipt of EPA\n       grants, either as principal investigator or co-\n       investigator[,] or in a position that otherwise would\n       reap substantial direct benefit from an EPA grant.\n       This principle shall not apply to state, tribal or local\n       government agency recipients of EPA grants.\n\nDirective at 1.\n\f                                16\n     That \u201cprinciple\u201d represents a major break from the\nagency\u2019s prior policy, under which grantees regularly served\non advisory committees. As EPA\u2019s Office of the Inspector\nGeneral explained in its 2013 report, while \u201c[a] prospective or\nactive member\u2019s research or grant is a potential area of concern\nif the [Federal Advisory Committee], panel, or subcommittee\nplans to address work performed under the research grant,\u201d the\nagency generally \u201cd[id] not consider a prospective or current\nmember\u2019s receipt of an agency or other federal research grant\nto create the basis for a financial conflict of interest.\u201d Office of\nthe Inspector General, supra, at 9\u201310. Making the same point,\nEPA\u2019s Peer Review Handbook states that \u201cwhen a scientist is\nawarded an EPA research grant through an investigator-\ninitiated, peer-reviewed competition, there generally should be\nno question as to that scientist\u2019s ability to offer independent\nscientific advice to the Agency on other projects.\u201d Science and\nTechnology Policy Council, EPA, Peer Review Handbook 77\n(4th ed. 2015), https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/file/\n2016-03/documents/epa_peer_review_handbook_4th_edition.\npdf. That policy comported with the view of OGE, which\nexplained that \u201c[a] special Government employee serving on\nan advisory committee\u201d who would otherwise be disqualified\n\u201cmay participate in any particular matter of general\napplicability\u201d so long as that \u201cmatter will not have a special or\ndistinct effect on the employee or employer other than as part\nof a class.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2640.203(g).\n\n    Reading the Directive, however, one would have no idea\nabout the existence of these prior policies. The Directive\nsimply declares \u201cthat no member of an EPA federal advisory\ncommittee be currently in receipt of EPA grants.\u201d Directive at\n1. The accompanying Memorandum is equally silent with\nrespect to EPA\u2019s prior policy. Here is its entire text, and not a\npeep:\n\f                                17\n       A vital part of ensuring integrity and confidence in\n       EPA\u2019s [Federal Advisory Committees] comes from\n       guaranteeing that [Committee] members remain\n       independent of the Agency during their service.\n       EPA [Committee] members should avoid financial\n       entanglements with EPA to the greatest extent\n       possible.\n\n       Non-governmental and non-tribal members in direct\n       receipt of EPA grants while serving on an EPA\n       [Committee] can create the appearance or reality of\n       potential interference with their ability to\n       independently and objectively serve as a\n       [Committee] member. [Committee] members\n       should be motivated by service and committed to\n       providing informed and independent expertise and\n       judgment.\n\n       Ensuring [Committee] member independence\n       strengthens the integrity, objectivity and reliability\n       of EPA [Committees]. Accordingly, in addition to\n       EPA\u2019s existing policies and legal requirements\n       preventing conflicts of interest among the\n       membership of the Agency\u2019s [Committees], it shall\n       be the policy of the Agency that no member of an\n       EPA federal advisory committee currently receive\n       EPA grants, either as principal investigator or co-\n       investigator, or in a position that otherwise would\n       reap substantial direct benefit from an EPA grant.\n       This principle should not apply to state, tribal or\n       local government agency recipients of EPA grants.\n\nMemorandum at 3.\n\n    EPA nonetheless argues that the Directive and\nMemorandum \u201cclearly satisf[y]\u201d APA standards because \u201c[t]he\nEPA Administrator issued the Directive precisely in order to\npublicize the agency\u2019s new priorities.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 42.\n\f                                18\n\u201cAnyone reading the Directive and accompanying\nmemorandum,\u201d EPA insists, \u201cwould understand that it was\nbeing issued precisely because EPA was marking a policy\nchange.\u201d Id. at 43. In its view, nothing more is required. In\nsupport, and quoting FCC v. Fox Television, EPA argues that\nhaving acknowledged its change in course by issuing the\nDirective, \u201cto withstand APA review, \u2018it suffices that the new\npolicy is permissible under the statute, that there are good\nreasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better.\u2019\u201d Id.\nat 43 (quoting 556 U.S. at 515).\n\n     EPA misunderstands the lesson of Fox Television. True,\nthat decision makes clear that when changing position \u201c[an]\nagency need not always provide a more detailed justification\nthan what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank\nslate,\u201d nor \u201cdemonstrate to a court\u2019s satisfaction that the\nreasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the\nold one.\u201d 556 U.S. at 515. Nothing in Fox Television, however,\nabsolves an agency of its obligation \u201cto enable\u201d a reviewing\ncourt to conclude that the agency\u2019s action \u201cwas the product of\nreasoned decisionmaking.\u201d State Farm, 463 U.S. at 52. In Fox\nTelevision itself, the Court explained that the rule that an\nagency must \u201cdisplay awareness that it is changing position\u201d is\nsimply a species of the more general \u201crequirement\u201d\u2014present\nin all APA cases\u2014\u201cthat an agency provide [a] reasoned\nexplanation for its action.\u201d 556 U.S. at 515. As the Supreme\nCourt subsequently explained in Encino Motorcars, LLC v.\nNavarro, although agencies remain \u201cfree to change their\nexisting policies,\u201d they still must \u201cprovide a reasoned\nexplanation for the change.\u201d 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016).\n\n    This EPA did not do. Regardless of whether the\nDirective\u2019s references to \u201cimproving\u201d and \u201cstrengthening\u201d\nCommittee independence might have been sufficient to\nacknowledge EPA\u2019s change in policy, the Directive and its\n\f                                19\naccompanying Memorandum failed to \u201cprovide a reasoned\nexplanation for the change.\u201d Id; see also State Farm, 463 U.S.\nat 43 (requiring agencies to \u201carticulate a satisfactory\nexplanation for its action\u201d). The Memorandum announces that\nindividuals \u201cin direct receipt of EPA grants while serving on\nan EPA [Federal Advisory Committee] can create the\nappearance or reality of potential interference with their ability\nto independently and objectively serve as a FAC member,\u201d\nMemorandum at 3 (emphasis added), yet nowhere even hints\nthat EPA and OGE\u2014the agency tasked with defining conflicts\nof interest\u2014had previously reached exactly the opposite\nconclusion: that grantees could, in fact, ethically serve. To be\nsure, \u201cno statute required specific discussion of th[ese ethics\nrules] or any other topic,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 44, but core principles\nof administrative law dictate that \u201can agency changing its\ncourse must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior\npolicies and standards are being deliberately changed, not\ncasually ignored,\u201d Lone Mountain Processing, Inc. v. Secretary\nof Labor, 709 F.3d 1161, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (emphasis\nadded) (internal quotation marks omitted). That \u201canalysis\u201d is\nentirely missing from the Directive and its accompanying\nMemorandum. An agency\u2019s wholesale failure to address \u201cpast\npractice and formal policies regarding [an issue], let alone to\nexplain its reversal of course . . . [is] arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\nAmerican Wild Horse Preservation Campaign v. Perdue, 873\nF.3d 914, 927 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n\n     The Administrator\u2019s failure to address OGE and EPA\u2019s\ncontrary conclusions is especially glaring given that the prior\nregime existed, in part, for the very purpose of facilitating the\ncritical role played by EPA\u2019s scientific advisory committees.\nAs noted above, EPA operates pursuant to multiple statutory\nmandates requiring that its decisions rest on various\nformulations of \u201cthe best available science.\u201d 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2625(h). And as EPA\u2019s Peer Review Handbook explains, the\n\f                                20\nagency\u2019s prior policy\u2014allowing EPA grantees to serve on\nadvisory committees\u2014existed, in part, to \u201censure that the\nscientific and technical bases of its decisions . . . are based upon\nthe best current knowledge from science, engineering, and\nother domains of technical expertise; and . . . are credible.\u201d\nScience and Technology Policy Council, EPA, Peer Review\nHandbook, supra, at A-4. Even the Directive itself agrees that\n\u201cit is in the public interest to select the most qualified,\nknowledgeable, and experienced candidates.\u201d Directive at 1.\nYet the Directive nowhere confronts the possibility that\nexcluding grant recipients\u2014that is, individuals who EPA has\nindependently deemed qualified enough to receive competitive\nfunding\u2014from advisory committees might exclude those very\ncandidates. The question, of course, is not whether the\nDirective, in fact, shrinks EPA\u2019s pool of experts but rather\nwhether EPA has given an adequate explanation for its new\npolicy. And in failing to grapple with how EPA\u2019s policy\naffected its statutory scientific mandates, the Directive \u201cfailed\nto consider an important aspect of the problem.\u201d State Farm,\n463 U.S. at 43.\n\n     At oral argument, agency counsel contended that the\nDirective need not have addressed any prior ethics policy\nbecause it focused on \u201cguaranteeing that [advisory committee]\nmembers remain independent of the agency,\u201d and therefore\ndoes not implicate ethics or \u201cconflicts of interest at all.\u201d Oral\nArg. Tr. 40. But that sharp distinction between \u201cconflicts of\ninterest\u201d or ethics, on the one hand, and \u201cindependence,\u201d on the\nother, appears nowhere in EPA\u2019s briefs, and \u201c[g]enerally,\narguments raised for the first time at oral argument are\nforfeited,\u201d United States ex rel. Davis v. District of Columbia,\n793 F.3d 120, 127 (D.C. Cir. 2015). In any event, EPA itself\nrefers to the Directive as \u201cethics-related\u201d throughout its brief,\nsee, e.g., Appellee\u2019s Br. 17 (contending that \u201cnothing in federal\nethics law purports to limit the factors\u2014including ethics-\n\f                              21\nrelated factors\u2014that an agency may, in its discretion, consider\nin prioritizing its committee appointments\u201d). Moreover, in\nterms of EPA\u2019s obligation to explain its reasoning, any\ndiscrepancy between \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cethics\u201d is a\ndistinction without a difference. EPA previously concluded\nthat grantees were capable of offering it independent advice; it\nnow concludes they are not. However EPA chooses to\ncharacterize the Directive\u2019s focus, its earlier determination,\nconsistent with OGE\u2019s conclusion, was clearly a \u201crelevant\nfactor[]\u201d the agency had to consider. State Farm, 463 U.S. at\n42.\n\n     Finally, EPA argues that \u201cthe Directive was issued against\na backdrop of well-known public disagreement regarding\nwhether the existing [OGE] regime was adequate.\u201d Appellee\u2019s\nBr. 46. Perhaps so, but that justification appears nowhere in\neither the Directive or Memorandum. EPA was required to\n\u201cprovide an explanation that will enable the court to evaluate\nthe agency\u2019s rationale at the time of decision,\u201d Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 654 (1990), and\ncounsel may not now \u201csupply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s\naction that the agency itself has not given,\u201d Bowman\nTransportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419\nU.S. 281, 285\u201386 (1974).\n\n     Of course, nothing prevents EPA from developing an\nappointment policy that excludes individuals it previously\nallowed to serve. To do so, however, EPA must explain the\nbasis for its decision. Because the Directive contains no\ndiscussion of OGE\u2019s or EPA\u2019s prior conclusion at all, the\nDirective \u201ccross[ed] the line from the tolerably terse to the\nintolerably mute.\u201d Greater Boston Television Corp., 444 F.2d\nat 852.\n\f                                 22\n                                 C.\n\n       This brings us to the Scientists\u2019 argument that the\nDirective is procedurally invalid and therefore contrary to law.\nIn support, they rely on OGE regulations that provide a\ndedicated procedural mechanism for allowing \u201c[e]ach agency\n. . . [to] issue regulations not inconsistent with this part and this\nsubchapter,\u201d using a specific process and \u201csubject to the prior\napproval of the Office of Government Ethics.\u201d 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 2638.602. Pursuant to those procedures, an agency may\npromulgate such \u201c[s]upplemental agency regulations which the\nagency determines are necessary and appropriate, in view of its\nprograms and operations, to fulfill the purposes of [Part 2635].\u201d\nId. \u00a7 2635.105(a). To do so, however, the agency must \u201cprepare\nand submit\u201d the supplemental regulations to OGE \u201cfor its\nconcurrence and joint issuance\u201d in the Federal Register. Id.\n\n     EPA does not claim to have complied with this process.\nInstead, it argues that the Directive falls outside the\nregulations\u2019 purview altogether. According to EPA, \u201cthe\nDirective does not seek to amend [ethics requirements] or to\nimpose legally binding ethical requirements on EPA\nemployees\u201d but instead \u201cis a statement of EPA\u2019s discretionary\npolicies and priorities for selecting the agency\u2019s advisory-\ncommittee members, who \u2018serve at the pleasure of\u2019 the\nagency.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 33 (quoting 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.130(a)).\nIn other words, like its contention that the Directive affects\nonly grantee \u201cindependence,\u201d EPA argues that the Directive is\nso far afield of an \u201cethics rule\u201d that OGE\u2019s process is simply\ninapplicable.\n\n     This argument fails for the same reasons as EPA\u2019s\ncontention that it had no obligation to address its prior ethics\npolicy: regardless of how EPA describes its new policy, the\nDirective invokes \u201cthe appearance or reality of potential\n\f                               23\ninterference\u201d to exclude individuals whom OGE concluded\nwere allowed to serve. Directive at 1. That policy falls squarely\nwithin OGE\u2019s ethics wheelhouse, and OGE guidance, cited by\nEPA, confirms this understanding. As the guidance explains,\n\u201c[i]mplementation . . . [of a] policy requiring the expansion of\nrestrictions on agency employees set by the Standards of\nEthical Conduct is likely to implicate the supplemental\nregulation process,\u201d as are policies that touch on \u201coutside\nactivity restrictions, prior approval requirements for outside\nactivities, [or] prohibited financial holdings.\u201d Memorandum\nfrom Don W. Fox, General Counsel, to Designated Agency\nEthics Officials 2 (Oct. 31, 2011), Appellants\u2019 Br. Add. 76.\nAnd although the Guidance clarifies that compliance with the\nsupplemental process is unnecessary where \u201cagencies . . .\nadvise employees to uphold a stricter standard of ethical\nconduct voluntarily as a best practice,\u201d an agency \u201cmay not\nimplement . . . [a] policy requiring some or all of its employees\n[to] receive prior approval before engaging in outside activities\nwithout issuing a supplemental ethics regulation.\u201d Id.\n(emphasis added).\n\n     Set between the poles of agency policies \u201cadvis[ing]\nemployees\u201d on \u201cbest practice[s]\u201d (which do not require joint\nissuance) and those \u201crequir[ing] . . . employees [to] receive\nprior approval\u201d (which do), the Directive clearly falls into the\nlatter category. It speaks in mandatory, not advisory terms:\n\u201c[m]embers shall be independent from EPA, which shall\ninclude a requirement that no member of an EPA federal\nadvisory committee be currently in receipt of EPA grants.\u201d\nDirective at 1 (emphasis added). This, moreover, is precisely\nhow the Directive was understood. In a declaration filed by the\nScientists, a former Director of EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board\nstates that he \u201cunderstood that the requirement that a member\nof an advisory committee not be a recipient of an EPA grant\n\f                              24\nwas mandatory and that EPA staff were required to apply it.\u201d\nZarba Decl. 6, Joint Appendix 124.\n\n     EPA has one more argument up its sleeve. Even were it\nrequired to comply with the OGE process, it argues, failure to\ndo so cannot form the predicate for an APA challenge because\nof a disclaimer contained in the OGE regulations stating:\n\n       A violation of this part or of supplemental\n       agency regulations, as such, does not create any\n       right or benefit, substantive or procedural,\n       enforceable at law by any person against the\n       United States, its agencies, its officers or\n       employees, or any other person.\n\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2635.106(c). EPA interprets this language to\npreclude judicial review of any failure to comply with OGE\u2019s\nprocess. We disagree.\n\n     The disclaimer applies only to individuals seeking to\nenforce \u201crights or benefits\u201d created by the regulations; it has\nnothing to say about challenges brought under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Nor could it. A properly\npromulgated regulation, standing alone, cannot thwart judicial\nreview otherwise available under the APA. Our court has made\nclear that agencies \u201ccannot adopt regulations erasing the\npresumption of reviewability embodied in the APA unless [the\nunderlying statute] reveals clear and convincing evidence that\nCongress intended to foreclose judicial review.\u201d Ball, Ball &\nBrosamer, Inc. v. Reich, 24 F.3d 1447, 1450 (D.C. Cir. 1994)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Neither the Ethics in\nGovernment Act nor the federal conflict-of-interest statute\ncontains such \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d\n\n     True, as EPA points out, we have read language like the\ndisclaimer to preclude judicial review of executive orders or\n\f                              25\ninformal, internal agency documents. See Appellee\u2019s Br. 34\u2013\n35 (citing, e.g., Air Transportation Association of America v.\nFAA, 169 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (holding that an executive\norder requiring a \u201csystematic analysis of expected benefits and\ncosts\u201d is \u201cnot subject to judicial review\u201d)). But for APA\npurposes at least, an executive order is a far cry from a final\nrule \u201cadopted pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking and\nundoubtedly . . . intended to carry the force of law.\u201d Aid\nAssociation for Lutherans v. U.S. Postal Service, 321 F.3d\n1166, 1174 (D.C. Cir. 2003). And, as explained above, such a\nfinal rule cannot preclude judicial review on its own. An\nagency\u2019s failure to comply with OGE\u2019s process is therefore\nsubject to judicial review irrespective of the disclaimer.\n\n                             IV.\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of the complaint and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   So ordered.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued February 19, 2020                Decided April 21, 2020\n\n                          No. 19-5104\n\n       PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY , ET AL.,\n                       APPELLANTS\n\n                               v.\n\nANDREW WHEELER, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL\n    PROTECTION AGENCY, IN HIS O FFICIAL CAPACITY,\n                    APPELLEE\n\n\n         Appeal from the United States District Court\n                 for the District of Columbia\n                     (No. 1:17-cv-02742)\n\n\n    Neil Gormley argued the cause for appellants.

In 2017, the EPA Administrator\nissued a directive that now prohibits all grant recipients from\nserving on any agency advisory committee. Three scientists\nwho had previously received EPA grants and served on\nadvisory committees, along with several non-profit\norganizations, filed suit, arguing that the directive was both\narbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\nThe district court granted EPA\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding\nthat the directive was unreviewable and, in the alternative,\nlawful. For the reasons explained below, we reverse.\n\n                               I.\n\n     Several environmental statutes require EPA to ground its\ndecision-making in scientific evidence. The Clean Air Act, for\nexample, mandates that \u201c[a]ir quality criteria . . . accurately\nreflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the\nkind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or\nwelfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7408(a)(2), and the Toxic Substances\nControl Act requires the Administrator to \u201cmake decisions . . .\nbased on the weight of the scientific evidence,\u201d 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2625(i).\n\n     To effectuate these statutory commands and ensure that\n\u201cnational efforts to reduce environmental risks are based on the\nbest available scientific information,\u201d EPA, Our Mission and\nWhat We Do (Feb. 7, 2018), https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/\nour-mission-and-what-we-do, EPA relies on twenty-two\nadvisory committees to provide scientific knowledge relevant\n\f                               4\nto the agency\u2019s statutory objectives. These committees serve a\nrange of functions. Some provide general knowledge across\nscientific domains, such as the Science Advisory Board (SAB)\nwhich offers \u201cscientific advice\u201d to EPA and Congressional\ncommittees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4365(a). Others are tailored to specific\nstatutory mandates. For example, the Federal Insecticide,\nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act requires the Administrator to\nconvene and consult a panel of \u201c7 members appointed by the\nAdministrator from a list of 12 nominees, 6 nominated by the\nNational Institutes of Health and 6 by the National Science\nFoundation,\u201d chosen \u201con the basis of their professional\nqualifications to assess the effects of the impact of pesticides\non health and the environment.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136w(d)(1).\nSimilarly, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to create the Clean\nAir Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), directing the\nAdministrator to appoint \u201cseven members including at least\none member of the National Academy of Sciences, one\nphysician, and one person representing State air pollution\ncontrol agencies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(d)(2)(A). And while\ncommittees may be \u201cadvisory\u201d in name, EPA engagement with\nsuch committees is often mandatory. The statute creating the\nSAB, for example, requires that the Administrator \u201cshall make\navailable\u201d to the Board \u201cany proposed criteria document,\nstandard, limitation, or regulation\u201d created under numerous\nenvironmental statutes and shared with any other agency,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\n\u00a7 4365(c)(1), </span><pre class=\"inline\">and the Clean Air Act requires that when issuing\nnotice of certain proposed rules, EPA must \u201cset forth or\nsummarize\u201d the findings and recommendations of CASAC\nand, \u201cif the proposal differs in any important respect from any\nof these recommendations,\u201d EPA must provide \u201can explanation\nof the reasons for such differences,\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 7607(d)(3).\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\f                               5\n      EPA advisory committees, like others throughout the\nfederal government, are authorized and regulated by the\nFederal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. app. II\n\u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.

GSA regulations, in\nother words, dictate that advisory committee members, just like\nall other government employees, are bound by federal ethics\nrules.\n\n     The ethics rules at issue in this case have been\npromulgated by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE),\nwhich is responsible for implementing two major ethics\nstatutes. The Ethics in Government Act directs OGE to provide\n\u201coverall direction of executive branch policies related to\npreventing conflicts of interest on the part of officers and\nemployees of any executive agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 402(a).\nAnd the federal conflict-of-interest statute likewise tasks OGE\nwith identifying \u201cthe types of interests that are not so\nsubstantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the\nservices the Government may expect from the employee,\u201d 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 208(d)(2)(B), and with granting class-wide\nexemptions from the ethics rules for certain conduct that is \u201ctoo\nremote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the\nservices of the Government officers or employees,\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\n\u00a7 208(b)(2).\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n     Pursuant to these authorities, OGE issued a regulation\nknown as the \u201cStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of\nthe Executive Branch,\u201d which interprets the conflict-of-interest\nstatute and \u201cestablishes uniform standards of ethical conduct\u201d\nfor all executive-branch workers. 57 Fed.

And in the Federal\nRegister notice announcing the uniform standards, OGE\nexplained that because agencies may need to \u201ctailor[]\u201d their\nethics rules \u201cto the functions and activities of a given agency,\u201d\nthe uniform standards provide \u201cauthority for individual\nagencies to issue\u201d additional agency-specific rules.

To be sure, as we shall later explain in our\ndiscussion of the Scientists\u2019 procedural challenge, infra at Part\nIII.C, an agency seeking to depart from OGE\u2019s uniform rules\nmay have to comply with OGE\u2019s supplemental-regulation\nprocess. But to the extent the Scientists view the Directive as\nan impermissible deviation from OGE rules, that grievance is\nprocedural, not substantive. The district court therefore\ncorrectly dismissed the Scientists\u2019 claim that the Directive is\ncontrary to law merely because it differs from OGE\u2019s uniform\nstandards.\n\n                               B.\n\n     In support of their claim that EPA\u2019s new policy is arbitrary\nand capricious because it lacks the indicia of a reasoned\ndecision, the Scientists argue that \u201cthe Directive and\nMemorandum evidence no awareness that EPA\u2019s new position\ncontradicts the executive-branch ethics standards\u201d and the\nagency \u201cfailed to rationally address its previous conclusion . . .\nthat EPA grantees can provide objective and unbiased advice\non matters unrelated to their grants.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 47, 52.\nWe agree with the latter point.\n\n     It is axiomatic that the APA requires an agency to explain\nits basis for a decision.

According to EPA, \u201cthe\nDirective does not seek to amend [ethics requirements] or to\nimpose legally binding ethical requirements on EPA\nemployees\u201d but instead \u201cis a statement of EPA\u2019s discretionary\npolicies and priorities for selecting the agency\u2019s advisory-\ncommittee members, who \u2018serve at the pleasure of\u2019 the\nagency.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 33 (quoting 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.130(a)).\nIn other words, like its contention that the Directive affects\nonly grantee \u201cindependence,\u201d EPA argues that the Directive is\nso far afield of an \u201cethics rule\u201d that OGE\u2019s process is simply\ninapplicable.\n\n     This argument fails for the same reasons as EPA\u2019s\ncontention that it had no obligation to address its prior ethics\npolicy: regardless of how EPA describes its new policy, the\nDirective invokes \u201cthe appearance or reality of potential\n\f                               23\ninterference\u201d to exclude individuals whom OGE concluded\nwere allowed to serve. Directive at 1. That policy falls squarely\nwithin OGE\u2019s ethics wheelhouse, and OGE guidance, cited by\nEPA, confirms this understanding. As the guidance explains,\n\u201c[i]mplementation . . . [of a] policy requiring the expansion of\nrestrictions on agency employees set by the Standards of\nEthical Conduct is likely to implicate the supplemental\nregulation process,\u201d as are policies that touch on \u201coutside\nactivity restrictions, prior approval requirements for outside\nactivities, [or] prohibited financial holdings.\u201d Memorandum\nfrom Don W. Fox, General Counsel, to Designated Agency\nEthics Officials 2 (Oct. 31, 2011), Appellants\u2019 Br. Add. 76.\nAnd although the Guidance clarifies that compliance with the\nsupplemental process is unnecessary where \u201cagencies . . .\nadvise employees to uphold a stricter standard of ethical\nconduct voluntarily as a best practice,\u201d an agency \u201cmay not\nimplement . . . [a] policy requiring some or all of its employees\n[to] receive prior approval before engaging in outside activities\nwithout issuing a supplemental ethics regulation.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n(emphasis added).\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n     Set between the poles of agency policies \u201cadvis[ing]\nemployees\u201d on \u201cbest practice[s]\u201d (which do not require joint\nissuance) and those \u201crequir[ing] . . . employees [to] receive\nprior approval\u201d (which do), the Directive clearly falls into the\nlatter category. It speaks in mandatory, not advisory terms:\n\u201c[m]embers shall be independent from EPA, which shall\ninclude a requirement that no member of an EPA federal\nadvisory committee be currently in receipt of EPA grants.\u201d\nDirective at 1 (emphasis added). This, moreover, is precisely\nhow the Directive was understood. In a declaration filed by the\nScientists, a former Director of EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board\nstates that he \u201cunderstood that the requirement that a member\nof an advisory committee not be a recipient of an EPA grant\n\f                              24\nwas mandatory and that EPA staff were required to apply it.\u201d\nZarba Decl. 6, Joint Appendix 124.\n\n     EPA has one more argument up its sleeve. Even were it\nrequired to comply with the OGE process, it argues, failure to\ndo so cannot form the predicate for an APA challenge because\nof a disclaimer contained in the OGE regulations stating:\n\n       A violation of this part or of supplemental\n       agency regulations, as such, does not create any\n       right or benefit, substantive or procedural,\n       enforceable at law by any person against the\n       United States, its agencies, its officers or\n       employees, or any other person.\n\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2635.106(c). EPA interprets this language to\npreclude judicial review of any failure to comply with OGE\u2019s\nprocess. We disagree.\n\n     The disclaimer applies only to individuals seeking to\nenforce \u201crights or benefits\u201d created by the regulations; it has\nnothing to say about challenges brought under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Nor could it. A properly\npromulgated regulation, standing alone, cannot thwart judicial\nreview otherwise available under the APA. Our court has made\nclear that agencies \u201ccannot adopt regulations erasing the\npresumption of reviewability embodied in the APA unless [the\nunderlying statute] reveals clear and convincing evidence that\nCongress intended to foreclose judicial review.\u201d Ball, Ball &\nBrosamer, Inc. v.

But the CAA\u2019s federal scheme cannot be\nundone by a noncompliant State and, should a State fail to\nsubmit a plan within two years of the guidelines\u2019 issuance, the\nCAA directs the Administrator to impose a federal plan in that\nState.\n\n     The EPA issued guidelines for two categories of solid\nwaste incinerator well over two years ago and the\nAdministrator has not imposed a federal plan on noncompliant\nStates. Sierra Club filed a complaint in district court under the\nCAA\u2019s citizen-suit provision, seeking to compel the\nAdministrator\u2019s action. The district court determined that the\nAdministrator does not have a nondiscretionary duty to impose\na federal plan on a noncompliant State and dismissed the claim\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm for the\nreasons set forth infra.\n\n                                I\n\n     Toxic pollutants discharged by solid waste incinerators\nharm the environment and threaten human health. See Davis\nCty. Solid Waste Mgmt. v. EPA, 101 F.3d 1395, 1397 (D.C. Cir.\n1996) (\u201cCombustion . . . results in the emission of various air\npollutants, such as acid gases, organics, metals, nitrogen oxides\nand ash, some of which are considered to be carcinogens or to\nhave other adverse effects when inhaled.\u201d). Section 129 of the\nClean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429, therefore requires the\n\f                                3\nAdministrator to \u201cestablish performance standards\u201d for air\npollutants discharged by different categories of solid waste\nincinerators. CAA \u00a7 129(a)(1)(A). At issue here are\ncommercial or industrial solid waste incinerators (CISWI),\nid. \u00a7 129(a)(1)(D), and incinerators falling within the statute\u2019s\ncatch-all for \u201cother\u201d categories of solid waste (OSWI),\nid. \u00a7 129(a)(1)(E). The EPA last revised its CISWI emission\nstandards in 2013 in an action aimed to eliminate 34,771 tons\nof pollution annually, 78 Fed. Reg. 9112, 9131 (Feb. 7, 2013),\nand OSWI emission standards were last updated in 2005, 70\nFed. Reg. 74,870 (Dec. 16, 2005).\n\n     To implement these standards, the CAA distinguishes\nbetween \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d sources. Compare CAA\n\u00a7 129(a), with id. \u00a7 129(b). For new incinerators,\nimplementation of the performance standards is\nstraightforward\u2014any unit built or modified after the standards\nare promulgated must comply with them. Id. \u00a7 129(a)(2). More\ncomplicated is bringing existing incinerators\u2014i.e., the large\nmajority of regulated units neither constructed nor modified\nafter the standards took effect, id. \u00a7 129(g)(4)\u2014into\ncompliance with new emission standards. See Federal Plan\nRequirements for Other Solid Waste Incineration Units\nConstructed on or Before December 9, 2004, 71 Fed. Reg.\n75,816 (proposed Dec. 18, 2006); Federal Plan Requirements\nfor Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units,\n82 Fed. Reg. 3554 (proposed Jan. 11, 2017).\n\n     Initially, the CAA requires the Administrator to, inter alia,\nestablish emission guidelines for existing incinerators. CAA\n\u00a7 129(b)(1). The burden then shifts to the States, which must\nsubmit to the Administrator \u201ca plan to implement and enforce\nthe guidelines with respect to\u201d existing incinerators \u201c[n]ot later\nthat [one] year after\u201d guidelines are promulgated.\nId. \u00a7 129(b)(2). A State plan must be \u201cat least as protective as\n\f                                4\nthe guidelines\u201d and must ensure that all existing incinerators in\nthe State comply with the guidelines \u201cnot later than [three]\nyears after the State plan is approved by the Administrator but\nnot later than [five] years after the guidelines were\npromulgated.\u201d Id. \u201cThe Administrator shall approve or\ndisapprove any State plan within 180 days of the submission,\nand if a plan is disapproved, the Administrator shall state the\nreasons for disapproval in writing.\u201d Id. Thus, once the EPA\nissues guidelines: 1) each State has one year in which to submit\nan implementation plan for the Administrator\u2019s approval; 2) a\nState\u2019s plan must be at least as protective as the guidelines;\n3) the Administrator has 180 days to approve the State plan;\nand 4) the State plan must be tailored to meet a specific\ntimeline.\n\n     This case involves the Administrator\u2019s duties in the event\na State fails to comply with \u00a7 129(b)(2). If this happens, the\nAdministrator must \u201cdevelop, implement and enforce\u201d a plan\nto bring existing units into compliance with the guidelines.\nId. \u00a7 129(b)(3). The Administrator\u2019s \u201cfederal plan\u201d often\nmirrors the guidelines, i.e., a State that fails to create its own\nplan usually ends up with the EPA\u2019s guidelines imposed on it.\nSee, e.g., 82 Fed. Reg. at 3559 (\u201cThe emissions limits in this\nproposed CISWI Federal Plan are the same as those contained\nin the final CISWI [emission guidelines].\u201d); 71 Fed. Reg. at\n75,820 (\u201cThe emission limitations in this proposed OSWI\nFederal plan are the same as those contained in the [emission\nguidelines].\u201d).\n\n     To date, the Administrator has yet to impose a federal plan\nupon any State that failed to submit an implementation plan\nfollowing issuance of either the 2013 CISWI guidelines or the\n2005 OSWI guidelines. In response, Sierra Club filed a\ncomplaint in district court under the CAA\u2019s citizen-suit\nprovision, CAA \u00a7 304, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604, \u201cto compel the\n\f                                5\nAdministrator . . . to protect public health and the environment\nfrom the hazardous emissions of\u201d CISWI and OSWI.\nCompl. for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief at \u00b6 1, Sierra\nClub v. McCarthy, No. 16-2461 (D.D.C. Dec. 16, 2016), ECF\nNo. 1. Sierra Club\u2019s complaint suggests in passing that the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) also supports its claim.\nSee id. at \u00b6 3. Before the district court and now on appeal, Sierra\nClub has increasingly relied on this argument, see Appellant\u2019s\nBr. 1, 23, 32, and we therefore reach it in Section III infra. The\ndistrict court \u201cdismiss[ed] for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\nSierra Club\u2019s claims that [\u00a7 129(b)(3)] imposes\nnondiscretionary duties on EPA to \u2018develop, implement and\nenforce\u2019 federal implementation plans for the 2013 CISWI\nStandards and the 2005 OSWI Standards\u201d because the claims\nfell outside an applicable waiver of sovereign immunity. Sierra\nClub v. Wheeler, 330 F. Supp. 3d 407, 423 (D.D.C. 2018). 1\nSierra Club timely appealed to us.\n\n     \u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal\nGovernment and its agencies from suit.\u201d FDIC v. Meyer,\n510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994). Because sovereign immunity is\n\u201cjurisdictional in nature,\u201d we must assure ourselves that Sierra\nClub's claims fall within a valid waiver of sovereign immunity\nbefore allowing the suit to proceed. Id. We have jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s\ndismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. See\nAm. Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Azar, 895 F.3d 822, 825 (D.C. Cir. 2018).\n\n\n\n    1\n        Sierra Club also alleged that the Administrator \u201cmissed the\nstatutory deadline to review, and . . . revise EPA\u2019s standards for\nOSWI units.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 1. The district court granted summary\njudgment to Sierra Club on this issue, Sierra Club, 330 F. Supp. 3d\nat 423, and the \u201cEPA has not appealed from this part of the court\u2019s\norder,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 7.\n\f                                 6\n                                 II\n\n       The CAA\u2019s citizen-suit provision, CAA \u00a7 304,\n\u201cempower[s]\u201d \u201cprivate citizens . . . to enforce emission\nstandards by filing suit in district court.\u201d U.S. Sugar Corp. v.\nEPA, 830 F.3d 579, 609 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Sierra Club\u2019s suit\nwas brought under \u00a7 304(a)(2), Compl. \u00b6 64, which is a\nconditional waiver of sovereign immunity.2 It gives the district\ncourt jurisdiction over a claim \u201cagainst the Administrator\nwhere there is alleged a failure of the Administrator to perform\nany act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary.\u201d\nCAA \u00a7 304(a)(2). A duty is nondiscretionary under the CAA if\nit is \u201cclear-cut\u201d and requires the Administrator to act by a \u201cdate-\ncertain deadline.\u201d Sierra Club v. Thomas, 828 F.2d 783, 791\n(D.C. Cir. 1987). This interpretation of \u00a7 304(a)(2) is consistent\nwith the requirement that \u201ca waiver of sovereign immunity\nmust be \u2018unequivocally expressed\u2019 in the statutory text\u201d and\nambiguities \u201cconstrued in favor of immunity.\u201d FAA v. Cooper,\n566 U.S. 284, 290 (2012) (citations omitted). The district court\nheld that the Administrator\u2019s duty to act under \u00a7 129(b)(3) once\na state fails to submit a plan does not impose a date-certain\ndeadline. Accordingly, it concluded that it lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction under the CAA because the duty in question\nfailed to qualify for \u00a7 304's conditional waiver of sovereign\nimmunity. Sierra Club, 330 F. Supp. 3d at 421. We agree.\n\n\n\n    2\n        We note that Sierra Club did not assert an unreasonable delay\nclaim under \u00a7 304(a). \u201cTo establish a claim of unreasonable delay,\npetitioners must show that they have \u2018a right the denial of which we\nwould have jurisdiction to review upon final agency action but the\nintegrity of which might be irreversibly compromised by the time\nsuch review would occur.\u2019\u201d Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA,\n787 F.3d 544, 554 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Sierra Club v. Thomas,\n828 F.2d 783, 796 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).\n\f                                7\n     Because this case is one of statutory interpretation, \u201c[a]s\nalways, our inquiry starts from \u2018the fundamental canon that\nstatutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute\nitself.\u2019\u201d Butler v. West, 164 F.3d 634, 639 (D.C. Cir. 1999)\n(quoting Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U.S. 552,\n557\u201358 (1990)). We must decide whether the Administrator\u2019s\nduty to \u201cdevelop, implement and enforce a plan for existing\nsolid waste incineration units . . . located in any State which\nhas not submitted an approvable plan under this subsection\nwith respect to units in such category within [two] years after\nthe date on which the Administrator promulgated the relevant\nguidelines,\u201d CAA \u00a7 129(b)(3), is nondiscretionary under\nThomas. The answer hinges on the clause \u201cwithin [two] years\nafter the date on which the Administrator promulgated the\nrelevant guidelines\u201d and, specifically, what that clause refers\nto.\n\n     \u201c[T]he words of a statute must be read in their context and\nwith a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d Util.\nAir Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 320 (2014) (quoting\nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120,\n133 (2000)). Here, \u00a7 129(b)\u2019s overall structure belies Sierra\nClub\u2019s reading of \u00a7 129(b)(3). Subsection 129(b) generally\naddresses existing incinerators\u2014subsection (b)(1) requires\nemission standards to contain guidelines for existing\nincinerators; subsection (b)(2) requires States to submit\nenforcement plans for existing incinerators to the\nAdministrator; and subsection (b)(3) requires the\nAdministrator to develop a federal implementation plan for any\nState that does not comply with subsection (b)(2). In context,\nthen, \u00a7 129(b)(2) sets out how a State is to respond when new\nguidelines are promulgated; \u00a7 129(b)(3) is remedial, however,\nin that it prevents State inaction from defeating the statutory\nscheme.\n\f                               8\n     Under \u00a7 129(b)(2), a State must \u201csubmit [an\nimplementation plan] to the Administrator\u201d within one year of\nnew guidelines being promulgated and the Administrator then\nhas 180 days in which to approve or disapprove its plan. CAA\n\u00a7 129(b)(2). A State plan \u201cshall provide that each unit subject\nto the guidelines\u201d complies with them \u201cnot later than [three]\nyears after\u201d the Administrator approves the State plan and \u201cnot\nlater than [five] years after the guidelines were promulgated.\u201d\nId. An existing unit, therefore, should comply with new\nguidelines no later than four years and 180 days after guidelines\nare promulgated but the statute provides some leeway by\nrounding the upper limit to \u201cnot later than [five] years\u201d after\nthe guidelines\u2019 promulgation. Id.\n\n    At the same time, subsection 129(b)(3) fills the gap if State\ninaction stymies \u00a7 129(b)(2)\u2019s scheme:\n\n       The Administrator shall develop, implement\n       and enforce a plan for existing solid waste\n       incineration units within any category located in\n       any State which has not submitted an\n       approvable plan under this subsection with\n       respect to units in such category within [two]\n       years after the date on which the Administrator\n       promulgated the relevant guidelines. Such plan\n       shall assure that each unit subject to the plan is\n       in compliance with all provisions of the\n       guidelines not later than [five] years after the\n       date the relevant guidelines are promulgated.\n\nId. \u00a7 129(b)(3). The EPA reads the first sentence simply to\n\u201cidentif[y] when States should have submitted an approvable\nplan\u2014namely, two years after guideline promulgation.\u201d\nAppellee\u2019s Br. 22\u201323 (emphasis omitted). Sierra Club,\nhowever, believes the Administrator has a date-certain deadline\n\f                                 9\nof two years after guidelines are promulgated in which to\ndevelop, implement and enforce a federal plan. See Appellant\u2019s\nBr. 33. Applying traditional tools of statutory interpretation, we\nagree with the district court that the EPA\u2019s reading is correct.\nSee Sierra Club, 330 F. Supp. 3d at 417\u201318.\n\n    In statutory construction, the rule of last antecedent\n\u201cprovides that \u2018a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily\nbe read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it\nimmediately follows.\u2019\u201d Lockhart v. United States, 136 S. Ct.\n958, 962 (2016) (alteration in original) (quoting Barnhart v.\nThomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003)). The limiting phrase \u201cwithin\n[two] years after the date on which the Administrator\npromulgated the relevant guidelines\u201d modifies the phrase that\nimmediately precedes it\u2014\u201cany State which has not submitted\nan approvable plan under this subsection with respect to units\nin such category\u201d\u2014and nothing more. Under the ordinary\napproach, therefore, \u00a7 129(b)(3) does not create a\nnondiscretionary duty, i.e., one that is clear-cut and contains a\ndate-certain deadline when the Administrator must \u201cdevelop,\nimplement and enforce\u201d a federal plan.\n\n     Granted, \u201cthis \u2018Rule of the Last Antecedent\u2019 \u2018is not an\nabsolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of\nmeaning,\u2019\u201d Hays v. Sebelius, 589 F.3d 1279, 1281 (D.C. Cir.\n2009) (quoting Barnhart, 540 U.S. at 26), but no such indicia\nare present here. Sierra Club argues that \u00a7 129(b)(3)\u2019s \u201ccontext,\nstructure, purpose, and history,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 34, suggest it\nwas intended to create an enforceable two-year deadline\nbecause \u201c[i]t makes little sense that Congress would have\ncarefully set deadlines for every other step in the process but\nno deadline for this one,\u201d id. at 35. But the inclusion of\ndeadlines elsewhere in \u00a7 129 does not determine whether\n\u00a7 129(b)(3) contains one and it \u201cis highly improbable that a\ndeadline will ever be nondiscretionary, i.e. clear-cut, if it exists\n\f                               10\nonly by reason of an inference drawn from the overall statutory\nframework.\u201d Thomas, 828 F.2d at 791. Moreover, to make any\nsense, Sierra Club\u2019s reading requires that the phrase \u201cwithin\n[two] years after the date on which the Administrator\npromulgated the relevant guidelines\u201d does not modify its last\nantecedent. If \u201cwithin [two] years\u201d modifies everything before\nit as would be expected if the last antecedent rule does not\napply, see, e.g., Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO, Local\n3669 v. Shinseki, 709 F.3d 29, 34 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\u201cbetter\ninterpretation is that [phrase] modifies the entire description\u201d),\nthe statute would require the EPA to wait to see which States\ndo not submit plans within two years and simultaneously\n\u201cdevelop, implement and enforce\u201d a plan within the same two\nyears. This nonsensical reading is not a basis for departing from\nthe rule of last antecedent.\n\n     Because the district court determined that the\nAdministrator does not have a nondiscretionary duty to\nimplement a federal plan under \u00a7 129(b)(3), it dismissed the\ncase for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that the\ncomplaint fell outside the CAA\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign\nimmunity. See Sierra Club, 330 F. Supp. 3d at 421. Sierra Club\nbelieves this was error because its complaint alleged that\n\u00a7 129(b)(3) creates a nondiscretionary duty and \u201cthe absence\nof a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not\nimplicate subject-matter jurisdiction, i.e., the courts\u2019 statutory\nor constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br.\n25 (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523\nU.S. 83, 89 (1998) (emphasis omitted)). But Steel Co. and the\nother cases Sierra Club relies on address dismissal for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction if a complaint is \u201cso insubstantial,\nimplausible, foreclosed by prior decisions . . . or otherwise\ncompletely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal\ncontroversy,\u201d Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 89 (quoting Oneida Indian\nNation of N.Y. v. Cty. of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974)),\n\f                                 11\nnot, as here, where the complaint falls outside a statute\u2019s\nlimited waiver of sovereign immunity, see Council on Am.\nIslamic Relations v. Ballenger, 444 F.3d 659, 666 (D.C. Cir.\n2006) (dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because\nclaim fell outside Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s sovereign\nimmunity waiver); Auster v. Ghana Airways Ltd., 514 F.3d 44,\n48 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (\u201cBecause the defendants have sovereign\nimmunity, the federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction in\nthis [Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act] case.\u201d). 3 The district\ncourt correctly dismissed Sierra Club\u2019s CAA claim for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.4\n\n                                 III\n\n     Sierra Club argues in the alternative that the APA grants\njurisdiction because it \u201cwaives sovereign immunity in all suits\nfor non-monetary relief against the government or a\ngovernment official in his or her official capacity[,]\u201d\n\n     3\n        Other circuits have also found dismissal for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction appropriate in cases brought under the CAA\u2019s\ncitizen-suit provision. See Murray Energy Corp. v. EPA, 861 F.3d\n529, 537 (4th Cir. 2017); WildEarth Guardians v. McCarthy,\n772 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir. 2014).\n      4\n        We see no conflict between our holding on this point and the\ndecision in Sierra Club v. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848 (D.C. Cir.\n2011). Although       Jackson     also    involved     an    allegedly\nnondiscretionary duty under the CAA, id. at 852, the Jackson court\nconstrued the cause of action as arising under the APA, id. at 855,\nand it was on this basis that the court found dismissal for failure to\nstate a claim the proper resolution in the absence of a mandatory\nduty, id. at 856-57. See Oryszak v. Sullivan, 576 F.3d 522, 526 (D.C.\nCir. 2009) (dismissing under Rule 12(b)(6) the APA claim brought\nunder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 because the APA does not create subject matter\njurisdiction and \u201cthe APA provides no cause of action to review\u201d a\ndecision that \u201cis an \u2018agency action ... committed to agency discretion\nby law.\u2019\u201d).\n\f                                 12\nAppellant\u2019s Br. 31 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702), and that we \u201cha[ve]\nrepeatedly and expressly held in the broadest terms that the\n[APA\u2019s] waiver of sovereign immunity applies to any suit\nwhether under the [APA] or not,\u201d id. at 32 (quotation marks\nomitted) (citing Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591,\n620 (D.C. Cir. 2017)). But the APA does not support\njurisdiction here because it contains a carve-out that prevents a\nplaintiff from using its general sovereign immunity waiver to\nevade limitations contained in other statutes like the CAA. See\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (\u201cNothing [in the APA] . . . affects other\nlimitations on judicial review or . . . confers authority to grant\nrelief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly\nor impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.\u201d).\n\n     Sierra Club\u2019s argument is foreclosed by Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak,\n567 U.S. 209 (2012), which involved the APA\u2019s interplay with\nthe Quiet Title Act (QTA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a. Although the\nSupreme Court concluded that Patchak\u2019s APA claim fell within\nthe APA\u2019s general sovereign immunity waiver, it reached that\nconclusion only because the QTA \u201cis not addressed to the type\nof grievance which the plaintiff [sought] to assert.\u201d Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians, 567 U.S. at\n216 (citation omitted). Here, the CAA is \u201caddressed to the type\nof grievance\u201d Sierra Club seeks to assert and \u201c\u2018[w]hen\nCongress has dealt in particularity with a claim and [has]\nintended a specific remedy\u2019\u2014including its exceptions\u2014to be\nexclusive, that is the end of the matter; the APA does not undo\nthe judgment.\u201d Id.

In other cases, we described the APA's waiver\nbroadly because the claims at issue did not involve a limiting\nprinciple in another statute affording relief. See, e.g., Trudeau v.\nFTC, 456 F.3d 178, 185\u201386 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Chamber of\nCommerce v. Reich, 73 F.3d 1322, 1328\u201330 (D.C.

Unmoved, apparently, by plain congressional intent,\nEPA forwarded to this Court an interpretation of a portion of\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(b)(3) that, while it would protect EPA from\nthe consequences of its nonfeasance, flies in the face of both\nreason and the statute\u2019s evident purposes, and thus deserves\ncomment.\n\n     Lackadaisical regulation of air pollution prompted\nCongress to amend the Clean Air Act in 1990. New Jersey v.\nEPA, 517 F.3d 574, 578 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (noting Congress\u2019s\n\u201cconcern[] about the slow pace\u201d of EPA\u2019s regulation of\nhazardous air pollutants); S. REP. NO. 101-228 (1989), as\nreprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3385, 3389 (referring to air as\na \u201cnational resource,\u201d and noting that \u201c[t]o protect this resource\na strong national control strategy is needed\u201d). Little was left to\nthe imagination; as relevant here, the 1990 amendments baked\ninto the Clean Air Act various directives concerning EPA\u2019s\nregulation of solid waste incineration units (\u201cSWIUs\u201d). 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7429; see Davis Cty. Solid Waste Mgmt. v. EPA, 101\nF.3d 1395, 1398-99 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (outlining \u00a7 7429\u2019s\ndirectives to EPA with regard to SWIUs), amended on other\ngrounds on reh\u2019g, 108 F.3d 1454 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n     Fast-forward to the present, however, and it is evident that\nEPA is not exactly on the ball; for instance, despite\n\u00a7 7429(b)(3)\u2019s edict that a federal implementation plan \u201cshall\nassure that each [SWIU] subject to the plan is in compliance\nwith all provisions of the guidelines not later than 5 years after\nthe date the relevant guidelines are promulgated[,]\u201d EPA has\nnot to date \u201cimpose[d] a federal plan upon any State that [would\nbe subject to such] plan following issuance of either the 2013\nCISWI guidelines or the 2005 OSWI guidelines.\u201d Majority\nOp. at 4. EPA, when questioned on this point at oral argument,\n\f                                 2\nasserted to the Court that the at-issue provision of \u00a7 7429(b)(3)\ndoes not require promulgation of the federal plan on any\nparticular timeline (say, within five years of the promulgation\nof the relevant guidelines) \u2013 no, according to EPA, the statutory\ndirective pertains merely to the content of the federal plan.\nOral Arg. Recording at 21:48-22:41. Accordingly, it would\nseem, a federal plan that issued ten or twenty or a hundred years\nafter the promulgation of the relevant guidelines would answer\nthe call of the statute if it set forth means by which compliance\nwith the guidelines would have been achieved within five years\nif EPA had issued the plan prior to the elapse of those five years\n\u2013 which, EPA says, it is not required to do. See id. at 21:48-\n23:47.\n\n      Though it is nigh on impossible to square this argument\nwith rationality, its root \u2013 its raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2013 is abundantly clear:\nHaving no statutory command to issue its federal\nimplementation plan within five years of the promulgation of\nthe relevant guidelines would free EPA from liability for\nfailure, in this regard, to perform a nondiscretionary duty under\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a)(2) (an academic point for the moment,\nsince, as relevant here, Sierra Club sought only to enforce a\ntwo-year deadline. See Compl. for Declaratory and Injunctive\nRelief at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66, Sierra Club v. McCarthy, No. 16-2461 (D.D.C.\nDec. 16, 2016), ECF No. 1.). EPA was quick to assert at oral\nargument that a suit for agency action unreasonably delayed\ncould instead be brought, Oral Arg. Recording at 23:38-23:47\n\u2013 but of course the legal framework for a suit under 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 706(1) presents plaintiffs with quite an uphill climb, see, e.g.,\nCobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (noting\nthat \u201ccourts are reluctant to upset existing agency priorities, . .\n. . [a]n agency\u2019s own timetable for performing its duties in the\nabsence of a statutory deadline is due \u2018considerable\ndeference[,]\u2019 . . . . [and] \u2018a finding that delay is unreasonable\ndoes not, alone, justify judicial intervention.\u2019\u201d (citations\n\f                                3\nomitted)). Relegated to the back burner of EPA\u2019s conceptual\nstove, somehow, is Congress\u2019s clear intent that the agency take\naffirmative and timely action to curb SWIUs\u2019 emissions of\ntoxic pollutants.\n\n     Sierra Club confined its complaint, as to \u00a7 7429(b)(3), to\nthe issue of whether EPA\u2019s failure to issue and enforce a federal\nplan within two years of the guidelines\u2019 promulgation\nrepresented a failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty,\nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-66, and it did not assert an unreasonable-delay\nclaim. But other suits seeking to enforce the provisions of the\nClean Air Act will certainly succeed this one. So we are left to\nhope that when EPA appears before this Court again, defending\nthose suits, its arguments will leave jurists, if not satisfied, at\nleast not compelled to describe those arguments in terms that\nborder on the indecorous.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued December 3, 2019               Decided April 17, 2020\n\n                        No. 18-5328\n\n                       SIERRA CLUB,\n                        APPELLANT\n\n                              v.\n\nANDREW WHEELER, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL\n    PROTECTION AGENCY, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY ,\n                   APPELLEE\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court\n                for the District of Columbia\n                    (No. 1:16-cv-02461)\n\n\n    Gordon E.

When the EPA issues such guidelines, States have\none year to submit to the EPA Administrator (Administrator) a\nplan to ensure incinerators within their jurisdictions comply\nwith the guidelines. But the CAA\u2019s federal scheme cannot be\nundone by a noncompliant State and, should a State fail to\nsubmit a plan within two years of the guidelines\u2019 issuance, the\nCAA directs the Administrator to impose a federal plan in that\nState.\n\n     The EPA issued guidelines for two categories of solid\nwaste incinerator well over two years ago and the\nAdministrator has not imposed a federal plan on noncompliant\nStates. Sierra Club filed a complaint in district court under the\nCAA\u2019s citizen-suit provision, seeking to compel the\nAdministrator\u2019s action. The district court determined that the\nAdministrator does not have a nondiscretionary duty to impose\na federal plan on a noncompliant State and dismissed the claim\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

If \u201cwithin [two] years\u201d modifies everything before\nit as would be expected if the last antecedent rule does not\napply, see, e.g., Am.

Cir. 1997).\n\n     Fast-forward to the present, however, and it is evident that\nEPA is not exactly on the ball; for instance, despite\n\u00a7 7429(b)(3)\u2019s edict that a federal implementation plan \u201cshall\nassure that each [SWIU] subject to the plan is in compliance\nwith all provisions of the guidelines not later than 5 years after\nthe date the relevant guidelines are promulgated[,]\u201d EPA has\nnot to date \u201cimpose[d] a federal plan upon any State that [would\nbe subject to such] plan following issuance of either the 2013\nCISWI guidelines or the 2005 OSWI guidelines.\u201d Majority\nOp. at 4. EPA, when questioned on this point at oral argument,\n\f                                 2\nasserted to the Court that the at-issue provision of \u00a7 7429(b)(3)\ndoes not require promulgation of the federal plan on any\nparticular timeline (say, within five years of the promulgation\nof the relevant guidelines) \u2013 no, according to EPA, the statutory\ndirective pertains merely to the content of the federal plan.\nOral Arg. Recording at 21:48-22:41. Accordingly, it would\nseem, a federal plan that issued ten or twenty or a hundred years\nafter the promulgation of the relevant guidelines would answer\nthe call of the statute if it set forth means by which compliance\nwith the guidelines would have been achieved within five years\nif EPA had issued the plan prior to the elapse of those five years\n\u2013 which, EPA says, it is not required to do. See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 21:48-\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">23:47.\n\n      Though it is nigh on impossible to square this argument\nwith rationality, its root \u2013 its raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2013 is abundantly clear:\nHaving no statutory command to issue its federal\nimplementation plan within five years of the promulgation of\nthe relevant guidelines would free EPA from liability for\nfailure, in this regard, to perform a nondiscretionary duty under\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a)(2) (an academic point for the moment,\nsince, as relevant here, Sierra Club sought only to enforce a\ntwo-year deadline. See Compl. for Declaratory and Injunctive\nRelief at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66, Sierra Club v. McCarthy, No. 16-2461 (D.D.C.\nDec. 16, 2016), ECF No. 1.). EPA was quick to assert at oral\nargument that a suit for agency action unreasonably delayed\ncould instead be brought, Oral Arg. Recording at 23:38-23:47\n\u2013 but of course the legal framework for a suit under 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 706(1) presents plaintiffs with quite an uphill climb, see, e.g.,\nCobell v.

Relegated to the back burner of EPA\u2019s conceptual\nstove, somehow, is Congress\u2019s clear intent that the agency take\naffirmative and timely action to curb SWIUs\u2019 emissions of\ntoxic pollutants.\n\n     Sierra Club confined its complaint, as to \u00a7 7429(b)(3), to\nthe issue of whether EPA\u2019s failure to issue and enforce a federal\nplan within two years of the guidelines\u2019 promulgation\nrepresented a failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty,\nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-66, and it did not assert an unreasonable-delay\nclaim.

After being charged as a\nfelon in possession of a firearm, Antwan Delaney moved to\nsuppress evidence obtained during a search of his vehicle on\nthe ground that the seizure preceding the search violated the\nFourth Amendment. Finding it a close call, the district court\ndenied the suppression motion. Although we too find the\nquestion close, we reach the opposite conclusion: when officers\nseized Delaney, they lacked the requisite suspicion to justify\nthe stop, meaning the subsequent search violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\n                                I.\n\n     The following comes from the district court\u2019s detailed\nfactual findings, which, with two minor exceptions noted\nbelow, neither Delaney nor the government challenges.\n\n     On December 31, 2017, officers Richard Willis and Jason\nBoockholdt were patrolling a residential area east of the\nAnacostia River. They conducted the patrol in uniform and in\na marked police cruiser, with Willis driving and Boockholdt\nriding shotgun. The officers \u201cwere specifically patrolling the\narea for New Year\u2019s Eve celebratory gunfire or other crime.\u201d\nHearing Tr. 71 (July 10, 2018).\n\n     Shortly after midnight, the officers heard \u201crepeated gunfire\nin multiple directions, including shots that the officers believed\nto be close by.\u201d Hearing Tr. 9 (July 12, 2018). The officers\nbegan canvassing the immediate area to determine the location\nof the shots. They first stopped at an alley, exiting the cruiser\nto investigate. The officers saw no one there but, while looking\n\f                                3\nabout, heard \u201cseven to eight gunshots coming from multiple\ndirections,\u201d a \u201cfew\u201d of which \u201csounded particularly close by.\u201d\nId. at 9\u201310. The officers got back into their cruiser to \u201cchas[e]\u201d\nor \u201cattempt to follow and investigate the sounds.\u201d Id. at 10.\n\n     After driving \u201cfor approximately one minute, reversing\ndirection[,] and turning a few times,\u201d they pulled into a \u201cnarrow\nparking lot.\u201d Id. at 6, 10. Activating the cruiser\u2019s \u201ctake-down\nlight, a spotlight that enabled them to better observe the area,\u201d\nthe officers encountered a line of parked cars. Hearing Tr. 72\n(July 10, 2018). One, a Jeep backed-in \u201cclose to an adjacent\nbuilding and/or cement block,\u201d was occupied by two\nindividuals: Delaney, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, and his\ncompanion, Jalisa Boler, sitting in the passenger seat. Id. at 73.\nAs the officers pulled into the lot, Delaney and Boler \u201cbeg[an]\nto kiss one another intensely.\u201d Id. at 72.\n\n     The officers stopped their cruiser near the parking lot\u2019s\nentrance, \u201cmore than 3 feet away from the nose of the Jeep.\u201d\nId. at 72\u201373. Although \u201cthe marked police car did not\ncompletely block the Jeep from exiting the parking lot, . . . it\nwould have taken some maneuvering, a number of turns for the\nJeep to get out of the parking lot.\u201d Id. at 73.\n\n     The officers exited their cruiser and approached the Jeep\nwith their weapons holstered. Willis approached the passenger\nside, and Boockholdt approached the driver side. Meanwhile,\nDelaney and Boler continued to kiss passionately, with\nDelaney \u201cstar[ing] at the police officers while kissing\u201d\u2014a\nreaction Willis found \u201codd.\u201d Id. \u201cNeither officer,\u201d however,\n\u201cobserved either of the passengers make any furtive gesture.\u201d\nId.\n\n    As Willis reached the Jeep\u2019s passenger-side window,\nDelaney and Boler stopped kissing and raised their hands.\nWillis then asked if they had heard gunshots. One of the\n\f                                4\npassengers\u2014\u201cit\u2019s not clear who\u201d\u2014replied that they had and\nthen \u201csaid something to the effect of \u2018we were just kissing.\u2019\u201d\nId. at 73\u201374. Willis replied, \u201cI can see that,\u201d id. at 74, to which\none of the passengers\u2014again, it\u2019s unclear who\u2014stated \u201cI\napologize, sir; I apologize,\u201d Hearing Tr. 15 (July 12, 2018).\n\n     While Willis questioned the passengers, Boockholdt\nsurveyed the parking lot with a flashlight. Returning to the\nJeep, Boockholdt instructed Delaney to \u201cpop the door real\nquick,\u201d to which Delaney replied, \u201cyou got it.\u201d Hearing Tr. 74\n(July 10, 2018). Boockholdt then opened the door himself and\nshouted, \u201che\u2019s got one, 95,\u201d signaling to Willis the presence of\na firearm. Id. at 75. After a brief scuffle, the officers detained\nDelaney. A subsequent search of the Jeep uncovered a handgun\nunder the passenger seat and spent casings on the passenger\nseat and outside both sides of the Jeep.\n\n      A federal grand jury charged Delaney, who had previously\nbeen convicted of a felony, with possessing a firearm after a\nfelony conviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).\nArguing that his seizure violated the Fourth Amendment,\nDelaney moved to suppress the firearm recovered from the\nJeep. The district court held an evidentiary hearing on the\nmotion, at which Willis testified and the government\nintroduced a handful of exhibits, including body-camera\nfootage that captured the officers\u2019 actions from the time they\nleft the alley up and through Delaney\u2019s arrest. After hearing the\ntestimony and \u201creviewing the exhibits in detail, particularly the\nbody camera footage,\u201d the district court made the above factual\nfindings. Hearing Tr. 2\u20133 (July 12, 2018).\n\n     It then turned to the merits of Delaney\u2019s motion. The\ndistrict court first found that no seizure occurred when the\nofficers drove into the parking lot and activated their take-\ndown light because, \u201c[c]onsidering all of the circumstances\n\f                                 5\nsurrounding the officers\u2019 entrance into the parking lot, I do not\nfind that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would\nfeel not free to leave the scene.\u201d Id. at 8. In the alternative, the\ndistrict court found that \u201ceven if a seizure did occur at the\nmoment that the officers parked their vehicle in the parking\nlot,\u201d no Fourth Amendment violation occurred because, at that\ntime, the officers had \u201ca reasonable, articulable suspicion that\ncriminal activity may be afoot.\u201d Id. at 8, 12. The district court\nnext rejected Delaney\u2019s argument that a Fourth Amendment\nviolation occurred \u201cwhen [the officers] exited their vehicle and\napproached the Jeep,\u201d explaining that such conduct fell short\nof a seizure and that, in any event, the officers had reasonable\nsuspicion to stop Delaney. Id. at 13, 14. Finally, the district\ncourt found that \u201can investigatory stop occurred when Officer\nBoockholdt directed Mr. Delaney to open the driver-side door\u201d\nand that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the stop. Id. at\n17. The district court therefore denied Delaney\u2019s motion to\nsuppress.\n\n     Because the government refused to offer Delaney a\nconditional plea that would have allowed him to appeal the\ndistrict court\u2019s ruling, the parties agreed to a stipulated trial, at\nwhich the district court found Delaney violated 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court then sentenced Delaney to a term\nof forty-six months imprisonment, and this timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n    The Fourth Amendment protects citizens \u201cagainst\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV.\nThis case concerns the latter protection.\n\n     A Fourth Amendment seizure occurs \u201cwhen physical force\nis used to restrain movement or when a person submits to an\nofficer\u2019s \u2018show of authority.\u2019\u201d United States v. Brodie, 742\n\f                               6\nF.3d 1058, 1061 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting California v. Hodari\nD., 499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991)). A show of authority sufficient\nto constitute a seizure occurs where \u201cthe police conduct would\nhave communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at\nliberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business,\u201d\nFlorida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 437 (1991) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), or, put another way, where \u201ca reasonable\nperson would have believed that he was not free to leave,\u201d\nUnited States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980). In\nmaking that determination, courts consider the totality of the\ncircumstances, including \u201cwhether the suspect was physically\nintimidated or touched, whether the officer displayed a\nweapon, wore a uniform, or restricted the defendant\u2019s\nmovements, the time and place of the encounter, and whether\nthe officer\u2019s use of language or tone of voice indicated that\ncompliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d\nUnited States v. Castle, 825 F.3d 625, 632\u201333 (D.C. Cir. 2016)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The person\nchallenging the seizure \u201cbears the burden of demonstrating that\nhe was seized.\u201d Id. at 633.\n\n     Although the Fourth Amendment generally requires that\nofficers have probable cause and a warrant to seize an\nindividual, they need neither probable cause nor a warrant to\n\u201cbriefly detain a citizen\u201d where they \u201cha[ve] a reasonable,\narticulable suspicion that \u2018criminal activity may be afoot.\u2019\u201d\nUnited States v. Edmonds, 240 F.3d 55, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2001)\n(quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968)). To \u201cseize[] a\nperson on less than probable cause,\u201d \u201ca police officer . . . must\nbe able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken\ntogether with rational inferences from those facts, support a\nreasonable and articulable suspicion that the person seized is\nengaged in criminal activity.\u201d Castle, 825 F.3d at 634 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). The government bears\n\f                               7\nthe \u201cburden to provide evidence sufficient to support\nreasonable suspicion.\u201d Id.\n\n     Where, as here, a district court denies a defendant\u2019s\nsuppression motion, we review de novo \u201cclaims regarding\nwhether and when a seizure occurred\u201d as well as the \u201cdistrict\ncourt\u2019s ultimate determination of whether a police officer had\nthe reasonable, articulable suspicion . . . necessary to legally\neffectuate\u201d the stop. Castle, 825 F.3d at 632 (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omitted). And when a district court makes\nfactual findings, as was the case here, we must \u201ctake care both\nto review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to\ngive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by\n[district court] judges.\u201d Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,\n699 (1996).\n\n     Significantly for our purposes, the government raises no\nclear error challenge to the district court\u2019s findings. That\nmatters because although aspects of the testimony and body-\ncamera footage might be thought to suggest that the officers\nhad a more specific idea of the approximate location from\nwhich some of the shots originated, that is not the only\nreasonable interpretation of the record, and the district court\nmade no findings to that effect. Rather, the district court found\nonly that the officers \u201cattempt[ed] to follow and investigate the\nsounds\u201d and encountered Delaney \u201cin close vicinity . . . to the\ngunfire.\u201d Hearing Tr. 10\u201311 (July 12, 2018). Indeed, the district\ncourt expressed skepticism that the record could support a\nfinding that the officers knew from which direction even the\nnearest shots came, explaining in a colloquy with Delaney\u2019s\ncounsel that the officers \u201cd[id]n\u2019t know exactly where [the\nshots] [we]re.\u201d Hearing Tr. 110 (July 10, 2018); see also id. at\n30 (Officer Willis testifying that he \u201ccan\u2019t say\u201d where the\n\u201cparticularly loud\u201d shot came from). For his part, Delaney does\nraise a clear error challenge, arguing\u2014albeit in a footnote\u2014\n\f                                 8\nthat the district court erred by finding that he made two separate\napologies to the officers, but we see no discrepancy between\nDelaney\u2019s and the district court\u2019s account of the relevant\nincident. Compare Appellant\u2019s Br. 15 (\u201cThe body worn camera\nvideo shows one apology, from Mr. Delaney. . . . \u2018I apologize,\nsir. I apologize\u2019\u201d), with Hearing Tr. 15 (July 12, 2018) (finding\nthat one of the passengers stated \u201cI apologize, sir; I apologize\u201d).\n\n     Accordingly, we must determine, in light of the district\ncourt\u2019s findings, when the officers seized Delaney and whether,\nat that point, they possessed reasonable suspicion to do so. We\naddress each question in turn.\n\n                                 A.\n\n     Our first task is to pinpoint the time of the stop. The district\ncourt found that the seizure occurred when Boockholdt ordered\nDelaney to open the driver-side door. Delaney, in turn,\ncontends that the stop happened much earlier\u2014namely, when\nthe officers parked their cruiser within a few feet of the Jeep\nand when Delaney submitted to that show of authority by\nstaying put. We agree with Delaney.\n\n     The officers\u2019 conduct on entering the parking lot amounted\nto a \u201cshow of authority\u201d sufficient to effectuate a stop. Hodari\nD., 499 U.S. at 626. In United States v. Goddard, 491 F.3d 457\n(D.C. Cir. 2007) (per curiam), we explained that although \u201cthe\npresence of a police car might be somewhat intimidating,\u201d\n\u201c[b]y itself, [it] is an insufficient show of authority to make a\nreasonable, innocent person feel unfree to leave.\u201d Id. at 461\n(internal quotation marks omitted). That said, we recognized\nthat \u201cadditional circumstances\u201d can transform an otherwise\nconsensual police-citizen encounter into a stop. Id. at 462.\nHere, several such \u201cadditional circumstances\u201d beyond the mere\n\u201cpresence of [the officers\u2019] car\u201d in the parking lot, id. at 461,\n\u201cwould have communicated to a reasonable person\u201d in\n\f                                 9\nDelaney\u2019s position \u201cthat he was not at liberty to ignore the\npolice presence and go about his business,\u201d Bostick, 501 U.S.\nat 437 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     First, the officers parked their cruiser a little over \u201c[three]\nfeet away from the nose of the Jeep,\u201d which \u201cwas backed up\nclose to an adjacent building and/or cement block,\u201d such that\nthe Jeep would have had to execute \u201ca number of turns . . . to\nget out of the parking lot.\u201d Hearing Tr. 73 (July 10, 2018). Such\n\u201crestrict[ions on] . . . movement[]\u201d are highly suggestive of a\nstop. Castle, 825 F.3d at 632 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In United States v. Johnson, 212 F.3d 1313 (D.C. Cir.\n2000), for example, we explained that \u201cblocking a vehicle can\nbe the kind of application of physical force that constitutes a\nseizure.\u201d Id. at 1317. Although no stop occurred in that case\nbecause the officer parked his cruiser \u201cabout 25 feet away from\n[the accused\u2019s] car, hardly close enough to block it,\u201d we\nobserved that \u201cif [the accused\u2019s] car had been blocked, he\nwould have been stopped.\u201d Id. Similarly, in Goddard, we found\nthat no stop occurred where officers parked their cruiser\n\u201cfifteen to twenty feet away from [a] group of men\u201d in part\nbecause \u201cnothing in the record indicate[d] that the officers . . .\nimpeded [the accused\u2019s] movement.\u201d 491 F.3d at 461. Here, by\ncontrast, the officers parked their cruiser just a few feet away\nfrom the Jeep, \u201cimped[ing] [Delaney\u2019s] movement.\u201d Id.\n\n     Second, upon entering the parking lot, the officers directed\ntheir cruiser\u2019s take-down light on the Jeep. Such aptly named\nlights \u201care designed to illuminate the stopped car as well as to\nprovide protection for an officer by blinding and disorienting\nthe car\u2019s occupants if they look back at the squad car.\u201d United\nStates v. Shelby, 234 F.3d 1275, at *1 n.1 (7th Cir. 2000)\n(unpublished table decision). Given \u201cthat a reasonable person\nplaced in a spotlight\u201d would feel unfree to leave, the use of such\nlights is suggestive of a stop. United States v. Packer, 15 F.3d\n\f                               10\n654, 657 n.3 (7th Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Tanguay,\n918 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2019) (noting that the use of take-down\nlights \u201ccomes close to communicating some type of\ncommand\u201d).\n\n     Finally, \u201cthe time and place of the encounter\u201d are\nindicative of a stop. Castle, 825 F.3d at 632 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). As the Seventh Circuit observed, when a\npolice encounter occurs \u201cat night\u201d and \u201cin a dark alley,\u201d a\nreasonable person would feel unfree to \u201cignore the police\npresence.\u201d United States v. Smith, 794 F.3d 681, 684\u201385 (7th\nCir. 2015). So too here: the officers encountered Delaney at\nnight in a dimly lit, \u201cnarrow parking lot,\u201d Hearing Tr. 6 (July\n12, 2018)\u2014factors suggestive of a stop.\n\n     Taken together, then, the officers\u2019 conduct\u2014pulling into\nthe narrow parking lot at night; training the take-down light on\nthe Jeep; and, most importantly, parking their cruiser within a\nfew feet of the Jeep\u2019s nose\u2014amounted to a \u201cshow of authority\u201d\nthat \u201cwould have communicated to a reasonable person\u201d in\nDelaney\u2019s position \u201cthat he was not at liberty to ignore the\npolice presence and go about his business.\u201d Bostick, 501 U.S.\nat 434 (internal quotation marks omitted). The government\u2019s\narguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.\n\n     The government first contends that Delaney could have\n\u201cmaneuver[ed] his car to exit the lot\u201d or else \u201cwalk[ed] away\nfrom . . . the encounter.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 22, 25 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But \u201cofficers need not totally restrict\na citizen\u2019s freedom of movement in order to convey the\nmessage that walking away is not an option.\u201d Smith, 794 F.3d\nat 686. To be sure, the district court found that \u201cthe marked\npolice car did not completely block the Jeep from exiting the\nparking lot,\u201d Hearing Tr. 73 (July 10, 2018), but \u201cit still seems\nunlikely that a reasonable person\u201d in Delaney\u2019s position,\n\f                                11\n\u201cplaced in a spotlight and knowing that he was the focus of\npolice attention[,] would believe that he was free to maneuver\nhis car out of the parking space,\u201d Packer, 15 F.3d at 657 n.3,\nmuch less leave the Jeep by walking away. Any such \u201cattempt\nto leave the scene would be so obviously likely to prompt an\nobjection from the officer,\u201d the Supreme Court explained in\nBrendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249 (2007), that no reasonable\nperson \u201cwould feel free to leave in the first place.\u201d Id. at 257.\n\n     What\u2019s more, although courts have consistently, and with\ngood reason, recognized \u201cthat investigative detentions\ninvolving suspects in vehicles are especially fraught with\ndanger to police officers,\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032,\n1047 (1983), such encounters also pose real dangers for the\nindividual stopped, especially were the individual to engage in\naction that officers would likely perceive to be evasive or\nthreatening, see e.g., Jackson v. District of Columbia, 83 F.\nSupp. 3d. 158, 162 (D.D.C. 2015) (describing incident in which\nan officer broke plaintiff\u2019s arm during a routine traffic stop).\nThus, a reasonable person in Delaney\u2019s position\u2014\nencountering officers late at night in a dimly lit and narrow\nparking lot, his exit partially blocked, a light blinding his eyes,\nand gunshots sounding all around\u2014would \u201cexpect that . . .\npolice officer[s] at the scene . . . will not let [him] move around\nin ways that could jeopardize [their] safety.\u201d Brendlin, 551\nU.S. at 258.\n\n     The government next argues that, regardless of whether\nthe cruiser restricted Delaney\u2019s movement, its location should\nplay no part in the stop analysis because the district court\n\u201cfound that the officers stopped their vehicle \u2018in a natural\nparking position, given the narrow parking lot.\u2019\u201d Appellee\u2019s\nBr. 28 (quoting Hearing Tr. 6 (July 12, 2018)). Relying on\ncases concerning drug interdictions on public transportation,\nthe government insists that restrictions on suspects\u2019 movement\n\f                               12\nare of no matter where, as the government claims is the case\nhere, an officer\u2019s \u201cposition is virtually compelled by the\nlocation of [an] interview.\u201d Id. at 29 (quoting United States v.\nTavolacci, 895 F.2d 1423, 1425 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).\n\n     The government\u2019s reliance on drug-interdiction cases is\nmisplaced. Those cases are premised on the notion that \u201c[l]aw\nenforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment by\nmerely approaching an individual on the street or in another\npublic place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some\nquestions, [or] by putting questions to him if the person is\nwilling to listen.\u201d Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But that principle caries little weight where, as\nhere, police conduct \u201clack[s] a traditional hallmark of a police-\ncitizen consensual encounter: the seemingly routine approach\nof the police officer.\u201d United States v. Jones, 678 F.3d 293, 300\n(4th Cir. 2012). By \u201cpull[ing] the police cruiser to a stop\u201d in\nthe parking lot\u2019s exit lane and activating their take-down light,\nthe officers made clear that \u201cthis was not a routine encounter,\nbut one targeted at [Delaney].\u201d Id. at 300\u201301. Thus, however\n\u201cnatural\u201d the cruiser\u2019s stopping position, the officers\u2019\n\u201ctargeted\u201d conduct toward Delaney indicated that he was not\nfree to ignore their presence.\n\n     Having established that the officers\u2019 conduct amounted to\na show of authority sufficient to effectuate a stop, we must next\ndetermine at what moment Delaney submitted to that show of\nauthority. In Brendlin, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cwhat\nmay amount to submission depends on what a person was\ndoing before the show of authority: a fleeing man is not seized\nuntil he is physically overpowered, but one sitting in a chair\nmay submit to authority by not getting up to run away.\u201d 551\nU.S. at 262. In that case, the Court held that a passenger in a\nmoving car subjected to a traffic stop \u201chad no effective way to\nsignal submission while the car was still moving on the\n\f                               13\nroadway, but once it came to a stop he could, and apparently\ndid, submit by staying inside.\u201d Id. The same holds true here: in\nresponse to the officers\u2019 show of authority, Delaney did not\n\u201cget[] up to run away\u201d but, instead, \u201csubmit[ted] by staying\ninside\u201d the Jeep. Id.\n\n     Likening this case to Johnson, where we found that no\nseizure occurred until the accused complied with an officer\u2019s\norder to raise his hands in the air, 212 F.3d at 1315, the\ngovernment contends that no submission occurred here until\nDelaney stopped kissing Boler and raised his hands. But the\ngovernment overreads both Delaney\u2019s kissing and our opinion\nin Johnson. As to the former, the kissing does not negate\nDelaney\u2019s submission because \u201ca defendant does not have to\nremain frozen in order to submit\u201d; rather, a stopped individual\nsubmits by \u201cremaining seated in his car when the police vehicle\napproache[s]\u201d\u2014precisely what Delaney did here. United States\nv. Stover, 808 F.3d 991, 998 (4th Cir. 2015). As for Johnson,\nthe accused in that case ignored the officer\u2019s express order and,\ninstead, made \u201cfurtive gestures\u201d that \u201cwere the very opposite\nof complying with [the] order.\u201d 212 F.3d at 1316. Here, by\ncontrast, Delaney neither ignored express orders nor \u201cma[de]\nany furtive gesture[s].\u201d Hearing Tr. 73 (July 10, 2018). Rather,\nas in Brendlin, Delaney complied with the officers\u2019 generalized\nshow of authority \u201cby staying inside\u201d the Jeep and \u201cby not\ngetting up to run away.\u201d 551 U.S. at 262.\n\n     For these reasons, then, a seizure occurred when the\nofficers pulled into the parking lot, partially blocked Delaney\u2019s\nvehicle, and activated their take-down light.\n\n                               B.\n\n     With the timing of the seizure established, we turn next to\nwhether, at that point, the officers possessed \u201cspecific and\narticulable facts\u201d to \u201csupport a reasonable and articulable\n\f                               14\nsuspicion that [Delaney] [wa]s engaged in criminal activity.\u201d\nCastle, 825 F.3d at 634 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Recall that the district court concluded that \u201ceven if a\nseizure did occur at the moment that the officers parked their\nvehicle in the parking lot,\u201d no Fourth Amendment violation\noccurred because, at that time, the officers had \u201ca reasonable,\narticulable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot.\u201d\nHearing Tr. 8, 12 (July 12, 2018). The district court found that\nfour factors, viewed together, gave rise to reasonable suspicion,\nnamely: (1) the officers \u201cencountered Mr. Delaney and Ms.\nBoler within one city block of where the officers heard repeated\nand close-by gunshots\u201d; (2) they \u201cencountered Mr. Delaney\nand Ms. Boler approximately one minute after hearing the\nsound of nearby gunshots\u201d; (3) the officers \u201csaw no one else in\nthe parking lot or while driving from the first parking lot where\nthey heard the shots\u201d; and (4) \u201cMr. Delaney and Ms. Boler\nexhibited very strange behavior when the officers approached\nthem in their marked police vehicle with a spotlight on and\nparked next to them.\u201d Id. at 12. Although Delaney suggests in\npassing that the officers saw other people en route to the\nparking lot, Appellant\u2019s Br. 29, he raises no clear error\nchallenge on that ground. The question, then, is whether, in\nview of the district court\u2019s findings, the government has carried\nits burden of establishing reasonable suspicion. Although a\nclose call, we conclude that it has not.\n\n     To be sure, Delaney\u2019s proximity to \u201cclose-by gunshots,\u201d\nHearing Tr. 12 (July 12, 2018), goes some way toward\nestablishing reasonable suspicion. But the Supreme Court\nmade clear in Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119 (2000), that\n\u201c[a]n individual\u2019s presence in an area of expected criminal\nactivity, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable,\nparticularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime.\u201d\nId. at 124. And here, any inferences of suspicion that the\n\f                               15\nofficers drew from encountering Delaney soon after hearing\nnearby gunshots are undermined by the government\u2019s failure\nto identity \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d supporting the\nofficers\u2019 estimation of where the various shots came from.\nCastle, 825 F.3d at 634 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     As noted, the district court found that while in the alley,\nthe officers heard \u201cseven to eight gunshots coming from\nmultiple directions,\u201d a \u201cfew\u201d of which \u201csounded particularly\nclose by.\u201d Hearing Tr. 9\u201310 (July 12, 2018). The officers then\ntried \u201cto follow and investigate the sounds.\u201d Id. at 10. But the\ndistrict court made no findings to suggest that the officers knew\nthe approximate location from which the various shots\noriginated. There are no findings, for example, that the officers\nheard the gunshots coming from the direction of the parking lot\nor that someone directed the officers that way. Cf. United States\nv. Bolden, 508 F.3d 204, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (finding\nreasonable suspicion existed in part because a pedestrian told\nofficers that shots emanated from \u201caround the corner\u201d). Indeed,\nquite the opposite: the district court explained that the officers\n\u201cd[id]n\u2019t know exactly where [the shots] [we]re.\u201d Hearing Tr.\n110 (July 10, 2018).\n\n     Compare that to our decision in United States v. Brown,\n334 F.3d 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2003), upon which the government\nprincipally relies. There, we held that reasonable suspicion\nexisted to stop, and eventually search, \u201cthe car in which [the\naccused] was sitting\u201d in part because officers received \u201ca report\nthat gunshots had been fired\u201d from the very \u201cparking lot in\nwhich [the accused\u2019s] car was parked.\u201d Id. at 1165. Here, by\ncontrast, the district court\u2019s findings indicate that the officers\npulled into the parking lot\u2014and thus stopped Delaney\u2014on\nnothing more than an \u201cunparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019\u201d\nabout the origins of the shots. Terry, 392 U.S. at 27. But \u201c[e]ven\ninspired hunches do not invest the police with the authority to\n\f                               16\nstop people at will.\u201d United States v. Ienco, 182 F.3d 517, 524\n(7th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      True, the district court found that the officers saw Delaney\nbefore they saw anyone else. But absent findings substantiating\nthe officers\u2019 estimation of where the shots came from, that fact\ndoes little to change the reasonable suspicion calculus because\nthe corresponding inference\u2014that Delaney might be the source\nof those shots\u2014no longer follows. Again, a comparison to\nBrown illustrates. There, the officers discovered the accused\nsitting \u201cinside one of the only two occupied cars in the lot,\u201d the\nprecise spot where gunshots had reportedly been fired, which\n\u201cenhanced the probability that criminal activity had been\ncommitted, or was being committed, by someone inside one of\nthe . . . occupied cars.\u201d 334 F.3d at 1165. Here, the officers\nmerely encountered Delaney in \u201cclose vicinity\u201d to where they\nestimated the shots originated from. Hearing Tr. 11 (July 12,\n2018). Moreover, the officers were patrolling a populated\nresidential area shortly after midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve, a\ntime when one would have expected other folks to be out and\nabout celebrating. Nothing differentiated Delaney from any\nother individual that the officers might have encountered\nnearby, except that the officers saw him first. Cf. Bolden, 508\nF.3d at 206 (finding reasonable suspicion existed in part\nbecause officers encountered the defendant fleeing from the\ndirection of where gunshots emanated). On the government\u2019s\naccount, the officers would have had reasonable suspicion to\nstop any and every individual they encountered in \u201cclose\nvicinity\u201d to the shots. Hearing Tr. 11 (July 12, 2018). That,\nhowever, \u201cdescribe[s] a very large category of presumably\ninnocent\u201d people and, accordingly, cannot \u201cjustify a seizure.\u201d\nReid v. Georgia, 448 U.S. 438, 441 (1980).\n\n    That leaves the kissing, which the district court\ncharacterized as \u201cstrange\u201d and \u201csuspicious.\u201d Hearing Tr. 11, 16\n\f                               17\n(July 12, 2018). \u201c[N]ervous, evasive behavior is,\u201d of course, \u201ca\npertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion.\u201d\nWardlow, 528 U.S. at 124. But not all reactions to seeing the\npolice are suggestive of criminal behavior. See United States v.\nJones, 584 F.3d 1083, 1087 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (\u201cMerely walking\naway, even quickly as appellant did, upon the arrival of the\nuniformed police officer would not provide articulable\nsuspicion of criminal wrongdoing.\u201d). And necking, especially\nshortly after midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve, hardly suggests that\n\u201ccriminal activity was afoot.\u201d Terry, 392 U.S. at 30. In\naddition, the district court expressly found that Delaney made\nno furtive gestures in the presence of the officers. Cf. Brown,\n334 F.3d at 1168 (finding reasonable suspicion existed in part\nbecause officers observed accused\u2019s furtive movements in\nparked vehicle). And neither the district court nor the officers\nfound Delaney\u2019s conduct, including the kissing, \u201cevasive.\u201d\nWardlow, 528 U.S. at 124. Accordingly, Delaney\u2019s perfectly\ninnocent, if odd, reaction to the police provides scant support\nfor the officers\u2019 reasonable suspicion determination.\n\n     We are sensitive, however, to the Supreme Court\u2019s\nwarning against \u201cexcessively technical dissection of the factors\nsupporting\u201d reasonable suspicion. District of Columbia v.\nWesby, 138 S. Ct. 577, 588 (2018) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Accordingly, stepping back and \u201cconsider[ing] the\nwhole picture,\u201d id. (internal quotation marks omitted), to\nensure we do not miss the proverbial forest for the trees, we see\nthe following: soon after hearing nearby gunfire, the officers\nencountered the Jeep\u2019s occupants in close vicinity to where the\nofficers estimated the shots emanated from. The officers saw\nno one else before coming across the Jeep and witnessed the\nJeep\u2019s occupants engage in odd but non-evasive conduct.\n\n     Although such evidence surely indicates that \u201ccriminal\nactivity was afoot\u201d broadly, Terry, 392 U.S. at 30, it raises no\n\f                              18\n\u201csuspicion that the particular individual being stopped\u201d\u2014that\nis, Delaney\u2014\u201c[wa]s engaged in wrongdoing,\u201d United States v.\nCortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981). \u201c\u2018Th[e] demand for\nspecificity in the information upon which police action is\npredicated,\u201d the Supreme Court explained, \u201cis the central\nteaching of this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,\u2019\u201d\nid. (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21 n.18), and specificity is\nprecisely what is missing here. The government has therefore\nfailed to carry its burden of establishing \u201ca reasonable and\narticulable suspicion that [Delaney wa]s engaged in criminal\nactivity.\u201d Castle, 825 F.3d at 634 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n                             III.\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, the officers violated the Fourth\nAmendment when they seized Delaney because they lacked\nreasonable suspicion to justify the stop. The government offers\nno argument as to why, were we to find that a Fourth\nAmendment violation occurred, an exception to the\nexclusionary rule would apply. We therefore vacate the district\ncourt\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   So ordered.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\n\nArgued January 30, 2020                Decided April 17, 2020\n\n                         No. 18-3093\n\n                UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n                        APPELLEE\n\n                              v.\n\n                   ANTWAN C.

After being charged as a\nfelon in possession of a firearm, Antwan Delaney moved to\nsuppress evidence obtained during a search of his vehicle on\nthe ground that the seizure preceding the search violated the\nFourth Amendment. Finding it a close call, the district court\ndenied the suppression motion. Although we too find the\nquestion close, we reach the opposite conclusion: when officers\nseized Delaney, they lacked the requisite suspicion to justify\nthe stop, meaning the subsequent search violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\n                                I.\n\n     The following comes from the district court\u2019s detailed\nfactual findings, which, with two minor exceptions noted\nbelow, neither Delaney nor the government challenges.\n\n     On December 31, 2017, officers Richard Willis and Jason\nBoockholdt were patrolling a residential area east of the\nAnacostia River. They conducted the patrol in uniform and in\na marked police cruiser, with Willis driving and Boockholdt\nriding shotgun. The officers \u201cwere specifically patrolling the\narea for New Year\u2019s Eve celebratory gunfire or other crime.\u201d\nHearing Tr. 71 (July 10, 2018).\n\n     Shortly after midnight, the officers heard \u201crepeated gunfire\nin multiple directions, including shots that the officers believed\nto be close by.\u201d Hearing Tr. 9 (July 12, 2018). The officers\nbegan canvassing the immediate area to determine the location\nof the shots. They first stopped at an alley, exiting the cruiser\nto investigate. The officers saw no one there but, while looking\n\f                                3\nabout, heard \u201cseven to eight gunshots coming from multiple\ndirections,\u201d a \u201cfew\u201d of which \u201csounded particularly close by.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n<span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 9\u201310. </span><pre class=\"inline\">The officers got back into their cruiser to \u201cchas[e]\u201d\nor \u201cattempt to follow and investigate the sounds.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span> at 10.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n     After driving \u201cfor approximately one minute, reversing\ndirection[,] and turning a few times,\u201d they pulled into a \u201cnarrow\nparking lot.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 6, </span><pre class=\"inline\">10.

A subsequent search of the Jeep uncovered a handgun\nunder the passenger seat and spent casings on the passenger\nseat and outside both sides of the Jeep.\n\n      A federal grand jury charged Delaney, who had previously\nbeen convicted of a felony, with possessing a firearm after a\nfelony conviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).\nArguing that his seizure violated the Fourth Amendment,\nDelaney moved to suppress the firearm recovered from the\nJeep. The district court held an evidentiary hearing on the\nmotion, at which Willis testified and the government\nintroduced a handful of exhibits, including body-camera\nfootage that captured the officers\u2019 actions from the time they\nleft the alley up and through Delaney\u2019s arrest. After hearing the\ntestimony and \u201creviewing the exhibits in detail, particularly the\nbody camera footage,\u201d the district court made the above factual\nfindings. Hearing Tr. 2\u20133 (July 12, 2018).\n\n     It then turned to the merits of Delaney\u2019s motion. The\ndistrict court first found that no seizure occurred when the\nofficers drove into the parking lot and activated their take-\ndown light because, \u201c[c]onsidering all of the circumstances\n\f                                 5\nsurrounding the officers\u2019 entrance into the parking lot, I do not\nfind that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would\nfeel not free to leave the scene.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 8. </span><pre class=\"inline\">In the alternative, the\ndistrict court found that \u201ceven if a seizure did occur at the\nmoment that the officers parked their vehicle in the parking\nlot,\u201d no Fourth Amendment violation occurred because, at that\ntime, the officers had \u201ca reasonable, articulable suspicion that\ncriminal activity may be afoot.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 8, </span><pre class=\"inline\">12. The district court\nnext rejected Delaney\u2019s argument that a Fourth Amendment\nviolation occurred \u201cwhen [the officers] exited their vehicle and\napproached the Jeep,\u201d explaining that such conduct fell short\nof a seizure and that, in any event, the officers had reasonable\nsuspicion to stop Delaney.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 13, </span><pre class=\"inline\">14. Finally, the district\ncourt found that \u201can investigatory stop occurred when Officer\nBoockholdt directed Mr. Delaney to open the driver-side door\u201d\nand that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the stop.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at\n17. </span><pre class=\"inline\">The district court therefore denied Delaney\u2019s motion to\nsuppress.\n\n     Because the government refused to offer Delaney a\nconditional plea that would have allowed him to appeal the\ndistrict court\u2019s ruling, the parties agreed to a stipulated trial, at\nwhich the district court found Delaney violated 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court then sentenced Delaney to a term\nof forty-six months imprisonment, and this timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n    The Fourth Amendment protects citizens \u201cagainst\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const. amend.

She sued the Secretary of Transportation for\nunlawful retaliation and discrimination, and sued the Secretary\nof Transportation and the Department of Labor for violation of\nher First Amendment right to run for office without penalty.\nThe district court dismissed her complaint for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Upon de novo\nreview, we affirm.\n\n                               I.\n\n    According to the complaint, Pueschel began working for\nthe FAA as an air traffic controller over forty years ago, in\n1974. Compl. \u00b6 6. Things did not always go well. In 1980,\nshe filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d)\nadministrative complaint alleging a pattern of sexual\nharassment by male employees, and in 1981, she sued the FAA\nfor alleged sexual harassment and reprisal. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14.\nAlthough losing in the district court, she prevailed on appeal\non the ground that she had been subject to a hostile work\nenvironment. Katz v. Dole, 709 F.2d 251, 256\u201357 (4th Cir.\n1983); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201319. Pueschel continued to file other EEO\ncomplaints against the FAA in 1990, 1992, 1997, and 2001.\nCompl. \u00b6 21.\n\n     Pueschel also suffered physical and emotional injuries\nstemming from her employment. Id. \u00b6 11. In May 1981, she\ninjured her back and neck at work and filed a claim for\nworkers\u2019 compensation with the Office of Workers\u2019\nCompensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d). Id. \u00b6 12. When she later\ncalled in sick due to back pain on the same day as an illegal air\n\f                                3\ntraffic controllers\u2019 strike, id. \u00b6\u00b6 15\u201316, the FAA fired her on\nthe assumption that she had participated in the strike and\nchallenged her benefits claim, id. \u00b6 16. Pueschel appealed and\nthe Merit Systems Protection Board reversed her termination.\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20. Then, in 1994, Pueschel experienced an anxiety\nattack on the job and never returned to work. Id. \u00b6 22.\n\n     In September 1998, OWCP granted Pueschel\u2019s claims for\nfull disability benefits based on the physical and emotional\nconditions resulting from her federal employment. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23,\n25. In 1999, the FAA terminated Pueschel\u2019s employment on\nthe ground she was no longer able to work as an air traffic\ncontroller, and this time her appeal of the termination of her\nemployment was unsuccessful. Id. \u00b6 24. Thereafter, Pueschel\nunsuccessfully ran for the United States House of\nRepresentatives between 2000 and 2004 and again between\n2012 and 2016. Id. \u00b6 27.\n\n     The FAA informed OWCP by letter of October 9, 2015,\nthat Pueschel had \u201cdemonstrated, and continues to\ndemonstrate, the ability to run for elective office,\u201d and that her\nactions disprove her doctor\u2019s contention she \u201cis \u2018permanently\ndisabled\u2019 and that \u2018it is doubtful that she will be able to work\nin any . . . capacity.\u2019\u201d Id. \u00b6 30 (quoting Letter from FAA to\nOWCP (Oct. 9, 2015)). In January 2016, OWCP reduced\nPueschel\u2019s benefits, stating that she \u201cwas now capable of\nworking full time as a \u2018customer service representative.\u2019\u201d\nId. \u00b6 31. When Pueschel wrote Margaret Gilligan, the\nAssociate Administrator for Aviation Safety at FAA, on April\n9, 2016, about these events and asked to return to work,\npreferably in the FAA Historian\u2019s office, id. \u00b6 33 (referencing\nLetter from Deborah Pueschel to Margaret Gilligan (Apr. 9,\n2016)), Gilligan responded by letter of April 15, 2016, that her\nrequest was a matter for Human Resources, id. \u00b6 34\n(referencing Letter from Margaret Gilligan to Deborah\n\f                                4\nPueschel (Apr. 15, 2016)). On August 8, 2016, Pueschel filed\nan EEO complaint, the dismissal of which was affirmed by the\nEEOC\u2019s Office of Federal Operations, which also denied her\nrequest for reconsideration. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 38\u201342.\n\n     Pueschel filed a three count complaint against the\nSecretary of Transportation and the Department of Labor for\nviolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2000e\u201316(a), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 794a, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 12101 et seq., and the First Amendment of the United States\nConstitution. Count one alleged that the FAA retaliated against\nPueschel in violation of the Rehabilitation Act and Title VII by\ninforming OWCP of her congressional campaigns, which\nultimately led to the reduction of her benefits. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44\u2013\n46. Count two alleged that the FAA violated the Rehabilitation\nAct and the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating\nagainst her when it failed to rehire her after she requested to be\nhired for a position commensurate with her disability. Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 47\u201349. Count three alleged that the FAA and OWCP\nviolated Pueschel\u2019s First Amendment right to run for office\nwithout penalty by reducing her benefits because she ran for\nCongress. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 50\u201352.\n\n    The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the complaint. Pueschel v. Chao, 357 F. Supp. 3d 18\n(D.D.C. 2018). The court dismissed Count one for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(1), finding Pueschel\u2019s retaliation claim\namounted to a collateral attack on OWCP\u2019s unreviewable\ndisability benefits determination. Id. at 26. The court\ndismissed Counts two and three for failure to state a claim\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), finding\nPueschel\u2019s discrimination claim against the FAA failed\nbecause she was not an \u201capplicant for employment\u201d within the\n\f                                 5\nmeaning of Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. Id. at 27. The\ncourt found that Pueschel lacked standing to bring a\nconstitutional claim against the FAA, id. at 28\u201329, which she\ndoes not challenge on appeal, and that Pueschel failed to state\na First Amendment claim against OWCP, id. at 29\u201330.\n\n     Pueschel appeals, and our review is de novo. Kim v.\nUnited States, 632 F.3d 713, 715 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Although\nthe court must assume the truth of well pled factual allegations\nand reasonable inferences therefrom, the court is not required\nto accept Pueschel\u2019s legal conclusions as correct. See, e.g.,\nDoe v. Rumsfeld, 683 F.3d 390, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2012). And as\na threshold matter, Pueschel\u2019s complaint must include\n\u201csufficient factual matter . . . to \u2018state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\n(2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\n(2007)).\n\n                                II.\n\n     On appeal, Pueschel contends that the district court erred\nas a matter of law in dismissing Count one of her complaint\nbecause it is not directed at any action by OWCP but rather\naction by the FAA. She contends that the district court erred in\ndismissing Count two by imposing a non-existent formal\napplication requirement for federal reemployment, relying on\na forty-five-year-old, out-of-circuit district court opinion that\ndid not involve a disabled employee trying to return to her\nformer agency. The dismissal of Count three was error, she\ncontends, because the federal government\u2019s demand that she\nsurrender her benefits imposed an unacceptable burden on her\nability to run for office. She notes that this court\u2019s precedent\ndid not involve a choice imposed by the government and\nmaintains that the district court\u2019s reliance on the Supreme\n\f                                6\nCourt\u2019s approval of the Hatch Act was inapposite to the issue\npresented.\n\n                                A.\n     The Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 8101 et seq., provides that the decision of the\nSecretary of Labor or her designee \u201cin allowing or denying a\npayment\u201d of federal workers\u2019 compensation benefits is \u201c(1)\nfinal and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all\nquestions of law and fact; and (2) not subject to review by\nanother official of the United States or by a court by mandamus\nor otherwise.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b)(1)\u2013(2). Consequently, as to\nCount one, Pueschel concedes on appeal that the prayer for\nrelief in her complaint is \u201cinartfully worded,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br.\n20, and urges Count one be read as \u201cnot . . . directed at any act\nby OWCP\u201d and \u201caimed solely at the FAA\u2019s conduct,\u201d id. at 14.\nSee also Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44\u201346; Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4. We agree\nCount one can be so read, and therefore our review is not barred\nby the Act.\n\n     Even so, the obstacle to Pueschel\u2019s reprisal claim, instead,\nis the significant gap in time between the FAA\u2019s 2015 letter\nnotifying OWCP of her ability to run for Congress, which\nPueschel alleges was retaliatory, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 45\u201346, and the\nEEO complaints she filed between 1980 and 2001, id. \u00b6\u00b6 10,\n21. Pueschel suggests this alternative ground should not be\nreached because the issue was not fully briefed in district court,\nbut the government presented this alternative ground in the\ndistrict court, and the issue has been fully briefed by the parties\non appeal. Our review of the sufficiency of a complaint under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is de novo. So \u201cwe\nmay independently assess\u201d that sufficiency. Kaemmerling v.\nLappin, 553 F.3d 669, 676 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\f                                7\n     Pueschel maintains that \u201c[a]s a former employee of the\nFAA, [she] is protected from actions by the FAA directed\nagainst her because of discrimination and reprisal claims she\nfiled against the [FAA].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 14. In Robinson v.\nShell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997), the Supreme Court\nrecognized a former employee\u2019s right to bring retaliation\nclaims, id. at 346. But Pueschel overlooks that in the absence\nof direct evidence of retaliation such claims are generally\nlimited to conduct occurring shortly after the employee\u2019s\nprotected activity. This court has viewed mere temporal\nproximity to support an inference of causation \u201conly where the\ntwo events are very close in time,\u201d Hamilton v. Geithner, 666\nF.3d 1344, 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Woodruff v. Peters,\n482 F.3d 521, 529 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). These cases were\nresolved on summary judgment, and not a Rule 12 dismissal,\nbut Pueschel cannot deny that there was a gap of almost fifteen\nyears between the FAA\u2019s 2015 letter about her congressional\nruns and her EEO complaints filed between 1980 and 2001.\nHere, the lack of temporal proximity prevents the court from\ndrawing a reasonable inference of causality when no additional\nfactual allegations support causation.\n\n     Although no bright line rule has been established, the\nSupreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he cases that accept\nmere temporal proximity between an employer\u2019s knowledge of\nprotected activity and an adverse employment action as\nsufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case\nuniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be \u2018very\nclose,\u2019\u201d citing approvingly cases where three- and four-month\nintervals were found insufficient to infer causality between the\nprotected activity and the adverse employment action. Clark\nCty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) (quoting\nO\u2019Neal v. Ferguson Constr. Co., 237 F.3d 1248, 1253 (10th\nCir. 2001)). The Court concluded that an action taken \u201c20\nmonths later suggests, by itself, no causality at all.\u201d Id. at 274.\n\f                                8\nThis court, too, has often analyzed temporal proximity in terms\nof months \u2014 not years. See, e.g., Harris v. D.C. Water &\nSewer Auth., 791 F.3d 65, 69 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (five months);\nHamilton, 666 F.3d at 1358 (three months); Mitchell v.\nBaldrige, 759 F.2d 80, 86\u201387 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (four months).\nIn Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1211 (D.C. Cir. 2006), upon\nconsidering whether the adverse action \u201ctook place shortly\nafter\u201d the protected activity, id. at 1220 (quoting Mitchell, 759\nF.2d at 86), the court concluded that that the plaintiff survived\nthe motion to dismiss because the alleged retaliation occurred\n\u201caround the time\u201d of his alleged protected activity and thus\nsupported a reasonable inference that the government acted\nwith a retaliatory motive, id.\n\n     Pueschel alleged that the FAA retaliated almost fifteen\nyears after her protected activity. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 46. Her\nretaliation claim rests solely on the fact that she was formerly\nemployed by the FAA and filed several EEO complaints\nbetween 1980 and 2001. Because these allegations, on their\nown, do not support a reasonable inference of causality,\nPueschel\u2019s complaint fails to raise \u201cmore than a sheer\npossibility that [the FAA] has acted unlawfully.\u201d Iqbal, 556\nU.S. at 678. Pueschel has shown no basis for the court to\nreverse the dismissal of Count one as we affirm on the alternate\nground of failure to state a claim.\n\n                                 B.\n     The Rehabilitation Act applies the substantive\ndiscrimination standards of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct to executive agencies, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791(f), 794(d), and\nit makes Title VII rights, remedies, and procedures available to\nfederal agency \u201cemployee[s] or applicant[s] for employment,\u201d\nid. \u00a7 794a(a)(1). Because Pueschel is neither an \u201cemployee\u201d\nnor an \u201capplicant\u201d within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act\nor Title VII, the district court ruled she failed to state a claim.\n\f                               9\nPueschel challenges the district court\u2019s reasoning underlying\nthe dismissal of Count two as assuming a material fact for\nwhich there is no support, namely a formal reapplication\nrequirement.\n\n     Pueschel maintains that as a former FAA employee she\nfulfilled any application requirement for reemployment when\nshe wrote to an FAA employee and requested a part-time\nassignment with the FAA Historian. See Compl. \u00b6 33\n(referencing her April 9, 2016, letter to Margaret Gilligan, FAA\nAssociate Administrator for Aviation Safety). The district\ncourt, in her view, incorrectly assumed that this letter was not\na sufficient application and that she was required to submit a\nformal application in order to be an \u201capplicant.\u201d Her letter to\nGilligan was incorporated by reference in her complaint and is\nproperly considered on a motion to dismiss. See EEOC v. St.\nFrancis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir.\n1997).\n\n     Even assuming that a former employee\u2019s request for\nreemployment does not require the formality of an application\nsubmitted by an individual with no prior employment history\nwith the agency, Pueschel\u2019s letter to Gilligan did not make\nPueschel an \u201capplicant\u201d for employment under the\ncircumstances. Pueschel, on her own initiative, wrote to an\nFAA employee with whom she was familiar; apparently\nGilligan had been managing her EEO complaints since the\n1980s, Appellant\u2019s Br. 7 n.4. Gilligan\u2019s reply by letter of April\n15, 2016, stated she \u201cwas unable to respond\u201d because this was\na matter for Human Resources. Compl. \u00b6 34. Although\nGilligan advised Pueschel that she needed to submit her letter\nto Human Resources, Pueschel does not allege that she ever\ndid. Neither does she allege that Gilligan had any connection\nto her requested position or to Human Resources more\ngenerally, or that Gilligan had any obligation to forward her\n\f                               10\nrequest to Human Resources. Pueschel also fails to allege that\nher letter obligated the FAA to offer suitable work pursuant to\nOWCP regulations. See, e.g., 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 10.505\u2013507.\nPueschel alleges only that she received no further response.\nCompl. \u00b6 34.\n\n     The district court, therefore, properly ruled that\n\u201c[s]ubmitting a letter to an employee who does not handle\nemployment-related requests does not make Pueschel an\n\u2018applicant\u2019 with respect to FAA.\u201d Pueschel, 357 F. Supp. 3d\nat 27. At minimum, Pueschel would need to send her letter to\nsomeone with the authority to grant her request or with an\nobligation to forward her request to the proper office or\nindividual. Otherwise, this type of letter \u201ccould be sent to any\none of hundreds or thousands of agency employees \u2014 or,\nworse, to unattended mailboxes or email accounts \u2014 and\nexpose an agency to litigation simply for failing to discover it.\u201d\nId. Because Pueschel never submitted her request in\naccordance with the FAA\u2019s division of responsibilities after\nreceiving explicit information on how to do so, Pueschel fails\nto show that the district court erred in dismissing Count two of\nher complaint.\n\n                              C.\n     After the FAA informed OWCP that Pueschel had\ndemonstrated an ability to run for elective office, disproving\nher doctor\u2019s contention that she was \u201cpermanently disabled\u201d\nand would be unable to work again in any capacity, Compl.\n\u00b6 30, OWCP reduced Pueschel\u2019s disability benefits, finding\nthat \u201cshe was now capable of working full time as a \u2018customer\nservice representative,\u2019\u201d id. \u00b6 31. Pueschel maintains that\nOWCP\u2019s determination violated the First Amendment because\nit relied \u201csolely on the fact that she was a candidate\u201d to\ndetermine that she was ineligible for certain disability benefits.\nOral Arg. Rec. 15:04\u201312 (Feb. 12, 2020).\n\f                              11\n\n     In Branch v. FCC, 824 F.2d 37 (D.C. Cir. 1987), this court\nrecognized that the \u201cright to seek political office . . . . is\nundeniable, though the Constitution and the Supreme Court\u2019s\ncases in the area do not pinpoint the precise grounds on which\nit rests,\u201d id. at 47. In Branch, a television news reporter\nmaintained that a federal statute \u201cextinguishe[d] his right to\nseek political office\u201d because it required broadcast media to\nprovide \u201cequal time\u201d to political opponents, and his station\nmanagement, relying on this statute, had advised him that if he\nwished to maintain his candidacy he must take an unpaid leave\nof absence during his campaign. Id. at 39, 47. The court held\nthat the statutory burden was \u201cjustifiable as \u2018both reasonable\nand necessary to achieve the important and legitimate\nobjectives of encouraging political discussion and preventing\nunfair and unequal use of the broadcast media.\u2019\u201d Id. at 49\n(quoting Paulsen v. FCC, 491 F.2d 887, 892 (9th Cir. 1974)).\nThe court further reasoned: \u201c[N]obody has ever thought that a\ncandidate has a right to run for office and at the same time to\navoid all personal sacrifice\u201d and \u201cmany people find it necessary\nto choose between their jobs and their candidacies.\u201d Id. at 48.\nFor support, the court cited the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7324(a)(2), which requires government employees to resign\nfrom work if they wish to run for certain political offices and\nwhich the Supreme Court upheld against constitutional\nchallenge in U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Ass\u2019n\nof Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 567 (1973).\n\n     Pueschel would distinguish Branch and Letter Carriers on\nthe ground that neither case involves the federal government\u2019s\nreduction of disability benefits. In her view this fact is\ndeterminative because both cases involved a constitutional\nchallenge to a federal statute and the justifications underlying\nthe federal statutes cited in these cases \u2014 prohibiting partisan\npolitical activity by federal employees or providing equal\n\f                               12\nmedia time to opposing candidates \u2014 are irrelevant to\nOWCP\u2019s decision here and Congress has not passed a statute\nrequiring OWCP to reduce disability payments to beneficiaries\nrunning for public office.\n\n     The issue is not whether Congress has prohibited political\ncandidates from receiving full workers\u2019 compensation benefits,\nbut whether the burden imposed by the federal statutes in\nBranch and Letter Carriers is analogous to the alleged burden\nimposed by OWCP\u2019s determination. Pueschel alleges that\nOWCP partially reduced her workers\u2019 compensation benefits\nbecause it had determined in view of her ability to run for office\nthat \u201cshe was now capable of working full time as a \u2018customer\nservice representative.\u2019\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30\u201331. That Pueschel may\nhave to choose between retaining full disability benefits and\nher candidacy \u201cdoes not differ in kind from the fact \u2018many\npeople find it necessary to choose between their jobs and their\ncandidacies.\u2019\u201d Pueschel, 357 F. Supp. 3d at 29\u201330 (quoting\nBranch, 824 F.2d at 48). Furthermore, her complaint contains\nno allegation that OWCP had animus toward her political\nactivity, either her decision to run for political office or her\npolitical views or running for office in general. Absent these\ntypes of circumstances, Pueschel\u2019s right to seek political office\nis \u201cnot implicated.\u201d See Branch, 824 F.2d at 48. Because her\nFirst Amendment contention is foreclosed by our precedent,\nshe has failed to show the district court erred in dismissing\nCount three of her complaint. To the extent Pueschel contends\nthat OWCP has uniformly interpreted FECA to hold that a\nbeneficiary\u2019s candidacy for office could not play any role in the\ndetermination of her disability or her benefits, her reliance on\nOWCP administrative cases on wage-earning capacity in view\nof later election to public office is misplaced. At issue here is\nwhether OWCP\u2019s determination that Pueschel demonstrated an\nability to perform work by running for public office violated\n\f                         13\nthe First Amendment \u2014 not whether her wage-earning\ncapacity was appropriately determined.\n\n   Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Pueschel\u2019s\ncomplaint.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued February 12, 2020              Decided April 14, 2020\n\n                        No. 18-5330\n\n                 DEBORAH KATZ PUESCHEL,\n                       APPELLANT\n\n                              v.\n\n ELAINE L.

She contends that the district court erred in\ndismissing Count two by imposing a non-existent formal\napplication requirement for federal reemployment, relying on\na forty-five-year-old, out-of-circuit district court opinion that\ndid not involve a disabled employee trying to return to her\nformer agency. The dismissal of Count three was error, she\ncontends, because the federal government\u2019s demand that she\nsurrender her benefits imposed an unacceptable burden on her\nability to run for office.

At issue here is\nwhether OWCP\u2019s determination that Pueschel demonstrated an\nability to perform work by running for public office violated\n\f                         13\nthe First Amendment \u2014 not whether her wage-earning\ncapacity was appropriately determined.\n\n   Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Pueschel\u2019s\ncomplaint.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/184066/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/419751/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186601/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145730/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118082/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/491630/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145875/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/186902/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/743063/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/316889/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/160666/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/450555/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2620700/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/108857/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/187263/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4525043/", "id": 4525043, "absolute_url": "/opinion/4744696/shabtai-shatsky-v-palestine-liberation-organization/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/4744696/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "date_created": "2020-04-14T15:00:43.491934Z", "date_modified": "2020-04-14T15:24:49.783157Z", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "e54f1e99a00d84f32e11dbd2d4170d5ed57fff36", "page_count": 35, "download_url": "https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/B32F906AE9A0B1F08525854A00510B32/$file/17-7168-1837979.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2020/04/14/shabtai_shatsky_v._palestine_liberation_organization.pdf", "plain_text": " United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued September 9, 2019             Decided April 14, 2020\n\n                       No. 17-7168\n\nSHABTAI SCOTT SHATSKY, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS PERSONAL\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF KEREN SHATSKY, ET AL.,\n                     APPELLANTS\n\n                             v.\n\n       PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL.,\n                       APPELLEES\n\n\n        Appeal from the United States District Court\n                for the District of Columbia\n                    (No. 1:02-cv-02280)\n\n\n    Tejinder Singh argued the cause for appellants.

See\nFamilies\u2019 Response to Palestinian Defendants\u2019 Statement of\nMaterial Facts at \u00b6\u00b6 1\u201313, Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org.,\nNo. 1:02-cv-02280-RJL (D.D.C.

In this case, the Families seek to hold the Palestinian\nAuthority and the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(collectively, \u201cthe Palestinian Defendants\u201d) liable for the attack\non the theory that they enabled the bombing through their\nprovision of significant support to the Popular Front.\n\n     As described in the complaint, the harms suffered by the\nFamilies as a result of the bombing are tragic and horrific. This\ncase, though, turns not on the merits of their claims for\nremediation, but on the narrow question of where those claims\nshould be litigated. We hold that the district court erred in\nrejecting the Palestinian Defendants\u2019 argument that the court\nlacked personal jurisdiction. We therefore vacate the district\ncourt\u2019s judgment and remand for it to dismiss the case without\nprejudice.\n\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n    On February 16, 2002, a suicide bomber attacked a\npizzeria in Karnei Shomron, a town in the West Bank.

J.A. 89. The United States government has\n\f                               4\ndesignated the Popular Front a foreign terrorist organization.\nSee 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189; see also Designation of Foreign Terrorist\nOrganizations, 62 Fed.

Reg.\n25,766, 25,766 (May 5, 2015) (maintaining the designation).\n\n     The Families allege that the Popular Front planned and\ncarried out the bombing. They contend that the Palestinian\nDefendants facilitated the bombing by providing financial\nsupport to the Popular Front. Specifically, they accuse the\nPalestinian Defendants of (i) paying the alleged mastermind,\nRa\u2019ed Nazal, a salary for a no-show job; (ii) covering some of\nthe Popular Front\u2019s necessary expenses, including rent for its\noffice in the nearby city Qalqilya, and (iii) providing what the\nFamilies call \u201cmartyr payments\u201d to Nazal\u2019s and Hafez\u2019s\nfamilies after their deaths. See Families\u2019 Br. 27\u201328.\n\n                               B\n\n                               1\n\n    Due to a number of procedural complexities, this case\nwended its way through district court for fifteen years. The\ncase started when the Families filed their complaint in\nNovember 2002 and served the Palestinian Defendants in July\n2003.\n\n    Two months later, the Syrian Defendants and the\nPalestinian Defendants jointly moved for a protective order to\nprevent the Families from moving forward with depositions\nbefore the defendants\u2019 \u201csovereign and governmental\nimmunity[] and other defenses\u201d could be litigated.\nDefendants\u2019 Motion for Protective Order at 1\u20132, Shatsky,\nNo. 1:02-cv-02280-RJL (D.D.C. Sept. 11. 2003), ECF No. 14.\n\f                               5\nThat same day, the Clerk of the Court entered a default against\nthe Palestinian Defendants under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 55(a) because they had not responded to the\ncomplaint by what the Families asserted was the deadline. By\nway of explanation, Rule 55(a) requires the Clerk to enter a\ndefault when a defendant \u201chas failed to plead or otherwise\ndefend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise[.]\u201d\nFED. R. CIV. P. 55(a). Once the Clerk does so, the plaintiff may\n\u201capply to the court for a default judgment\u201d under Rule 55(b).\nFED. R. CIV. P. 55(b)(2).\n\n    The Palestinian Defendants then moved to strike that\ndefault and requested additional time to respond to the\ncomplaint. While those motions were still pending, the\nPalestinian Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b), asserting among other\nthings sovereign and governmental immunity and lack of\npersonal jurisdiction. As for personal jurisdiction, the\nPalestinian Defendants argued that they lacked the minimum\ncontacts with the United States that the Due Process Clause\nrequires. They explained that their only contacts with the\nUnited States were the activities of Palestine\u2019s Mission to the\nUnited Nations and its ambassador in New York. The\nPalestinian Defendants argued that those diplomatic contacts\nwere \u201cgovernment contacts\u201d that could not provide a basis for\npersonal jurisdiction. J.A. 147\u2013148.\n\n    On June 23, 2004, the district court entered minute orders\ngranting the motions for a protective order and to strike the\nentry of default.\n\n    Eight months later, the district court denied the Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in a minute order that provided\nno reasoning. At a status hearing the next month, the\nPalestinian Defendants requested an explanation, but the\n\f                                 6\ndistrict court declined to provide one. The Palestinian\nDefendants then informed the court that they planned to rest\ntheir defense entirely on jurisdiction and were contemplating\nan interlocutory appeal.\n\n     The Palestinian Defendants, however, never took an\ninterlocutory appeal. After the Palestinian Defendants failed to\nfile an answer or otherwise participate in the litigation, the\nClerk of the Court entered a second default against them on\nApril 12, 2005.\n\n    The next month, the Families voluntarily dismissed their\nclaims against the Syrian Defendants without prejudice.1\n\n     On January 31, 2006, the Palestinian Defendants informed\nthe district court that they had new political leadership and\nsought a stay until May 1, 2006 to allow the new government\nto decide how to handle the litigation. The district court denied\nthe motion as moot in a May 30, 2006 minute order.\n\n     Almost a year later, the Families asked the court to enter a\ndefault judgment against the Palestinian Defendants under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b). In their brief opposing\nthe motion, the Palestinian Defendants reasserted their personal\njurisdiction argument: \u201cFor the reasons presented in their\nMotion to Dismiss and supporting memorandum, the\n[Palestinian Defendants] continue to contend that they have\ninsufficient contacts with the United States to warrant the\nCourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over them and reserve\nthat issue.\u201d J.A. 161 (citation omitted).\n\n\n    1\n       A plaintiff may \u201cdismiss an action without a court order by\nfiling * * * a notice of dismissal\u201d so long as the opposing party has\nnot yet \u201cserve[d] either an answer or a motion for summary\njudgment[.]\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\f                               7\n                               2\n\n     The Palestinian Defendants tried a new approach in\nDecember 2007. They moved to vacate the Clerk\u2019s entry of\ndefault, emphasizing that they were now \u201ccommitted to\nlitigating the case on the merits.\u201d J.A. 182 (formatting\nmodified). The Palestinian Defendants explained that, earlier\nin the litigation, they \u201cmight rightly have wondered why they\nwould be haled into U.S. courts to litigate claims\u201d that arose\nabroad \u201cagainst the backdrop of the Palestinian\u2013Israeli\nconflict.\u201d J.A. 183. But they told the court that they \u201cha[d]\ncome to appreciate that they need to address these cases head\non, rather than continuing to rely exclusively on jurisdictional\ndefenses.\u201d J.A. 183.\n\n     At the same time, the Palestinian Defendants filed an\nanswer that both responded to the merits of the complaint\u2019s\nallegations and, as relevant here, raised lack of personal\njurisdiction as an affirmative defense. The Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 brief in support of vacating the default \u201cconfined\ntheir discussion\u201d of the \u201cmeritorious defense\u201d requirement for\nvacatur \u201cto [the Palestinian Defendants\u2019] lack of\nresponsibility\u201d for the bombing. J.A. 205\u2013206. But the\nPalestinian Defendants also were explicit that, in focusing their\nargument on the merits, they did not \u201cwaiv[e] any of the\ndefenses raised in the verified answer[.]\u201d J.A. 205.\n\n     Three and a half years later, the district court granted the\nPalestinian Defendants\u2019 motion and vacated the default.\nShatsky v. Syrian Arab Republic, 795 F. Supp. 2d 79, 81\n(D.D.C. 2011). Although the court found the default willful\u2014\nin large part because the Palestinian Defendants\u2019 previous\ncounsel had represented that they \u201conly intended to litigate\njurisdiction and nothing more\u201d\u2014the court was \u201cnow convinced\nthat [the Palestinian Defendants are] truly committed to\n\f                               8\nlitigating this matter.\u201d Id. at 82\u201383. Because of that, the\ndistrict court concluded that the Palestinian Defendants\u2019\n\u201cwillfulness alone does not, on balance, preclude vacatur,\u201d and\nthat other considerations warranted \u201callow[ing] the parties to\nproceed on the merits.\u201d Id. at 83\u201385.\n\n    After nearly two years of discovery, the Palestinian\nDefendants moved for summary judgment on the merits in\nAugust 2013. They did not raise personal jurisdiction as an\nadditional ground for summary judgment.\n\n     While that motion was pending, the Supreme Court\ndecided Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014). That\ncase held that a court may exercise general jurisdiction over a\nnonresident corporation only if the corporation is \u201cessentially\nat home in the forum.\u201d Id. at 138\u2013139. Absent exceptional\ncircumstances, that standard is met only in the corporation\u2019s\n\u201cformal place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness[.]\u201d Id. at 139 n.19.\n\n     Based on Daimler, the Palestinian Defendants promptly\nmoved for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s earlier denial\nof their motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The\ndistrict court denied reconsideration solely on the ground that\nthe Palestinian Defendants had \u201crepeatedly manifested their\nconsent to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction through their conduct,\u201d and\nso had forfeited their personal jurisdiction objection. J.A. 300\u2013\n301. The district court stressed that, in seeking vacatur of the\ndefault, the Palestinian Defendants had \u201cinformed [the] Court\nof their \u2018seriousness\u2019 and the \u2018good faith\u2019 with which they\nintended to litigate their \u2018strong meritorious defenses.\u2019\u201d\nJ.A. 301 (quoting Memorandum in Support of Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 Motion to Vacate Clerk\u2019s Entry of Default at 5,\nJ.A. 176; and quoting id. at 40, J.A. 211). The district court\nadded that, although their answer \u201cpurportedly preserved the\n\f                                 9\npersonal jurisdiction defense,\u201d the Palestinian Defendants\u2019\nAugust 2013 summary judgment motion did not \u201cinclud[e] a\nchallenge to personal jurisdiction[.]\u201d J.A. 301. The district\ncourt subsequently denied reconsideration of that ruling.\n\n    In September 2016, the Palestinian Defendants again\npressed their personal jurisdiction defense, arguing in a\nsupplemental brief in support of summary judgment that the\ncourt should reconsider its forfeiture determination in light of\nWaldman v. Palestine Liberation Organization, 835 F.3d 317\n(2d Cir. 2016).\n\n     The district court subsequently granted summary\njudgment for the Palestinian Defendants. Shatsky v. Palestine\nLiberation Org., No. 1:02-cv-02280-RJL, 2017 WL 2666111,\nat *11 (D.D.C. June 20, 2017). The court first denied\nreconsideration of its finding of personal jurisdiction. Id. at\n*5\u20136. The court distinguished Waldman as turning on a change\nin Second Circuit law that made available in that circuit a new\nargument against personal jurisdiction. Id. at *5. The court\nheld that, by contrast, the argument pressed by the Palestinian\nDefendants had been available to them all along, and so was\nforfeitable. Id.\n\n     On the merits, the court held that the Palestinian\nDefendants were entitled to summary judgment on the Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims because no reasonable jury could find\nthat they had proximately caused the bombing. Shatsky, 2017\nWL 2666111, at *6\u201310.2\n\n\n\n    2\n      The district court also granted summary judgment on the\nFamilies\u2019 common law tort claims, reasoning that under District of\nColumbia law, the Palestinian Authority and the PLO were each\nunincorporated associations that could not be sued in tort. Shatsky,\n\f                               10\n    The Families timely moved for reconsideration under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), which the district court\ndenied. Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org., 292 F. Supp. 3d\n188, 192, 195 (D.D.C. 2017).\n\n     The Families timely filed a notice of appeal. FED. R. APP.\nP. 4(a)(1)(A), (4)(A)(iv). The Palestinian Defendants did not\nfile a cross-appeal.\n\n                               II\n\n     We first confront the question whether the district court\u2019s\ngrant of summary judgment to the Palestinian Defendants\nconstitutes a final, appealable judgment despite the Families\u2019\nearlier decision to voluntarily dismiss their claims against the\nSyrian Defendants without prejudice. Because the Families\nwere not attempting to circumvent the statutory limitation on\njurisdiction and because the district court remained in full\ncontrol over the litigation\u2019s progress to the dispositive entry of\nsummary judgment, we hold that the district court\u2019s ruling is\nan appealable final judgment.\n\n                                A\n\n     The district court exercised federal question jurisdiction\nover the Anti-Terrorism Act claims and supplemental\njurisdiction over the non-federal common law claims. See 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (federal question); id. \u00a7 1367(a) (supplemental).\n\n     Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we have jurisdiction to review\n\u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts. The district court\u2019s\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the Palestinian\nDefendants would certainly be final had they been the only\n\n2017 WL 2666111, at *10\u201311. The Families do not appeal that\nportion of the district court\u2019s decision.\n\f                                11\ndefendants all along. But the complaint also seeks relief from\nnine Syrian Defendants. In 2005, twelve years before the\nsummary judgment ruling in favor of the Palestinian\nDefendants, the Families voluntarily dismissed the claims in\ntheir complaint against the Syrian Defendants. The question,\nthen, is whether that voluntary dismissal rendered the district\ncourt\u2019s summary judgment order non-final. It did not.\n\n     A decision is final when it \u201cends the litigation on the merits\nand leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the\njudgment.\u201d Blue v. District of Columbia Pub. Sch., 764 F.3d\n11, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard,\n486 U.S. 517, 521\u2013522 (1988)). By contrast, a decision that\n\u201cresolves some, but not all, of the claims in a complaint * * *\nis generally non-final and non-appealable.\u201d Dukore v. District\nof Columbia, 799 F.3d 1137, 1140 (D.C. Cir. 2015). With a\nhandful of exceptions not relevant here, a party may appeal\nsuch a partial disposition only with the district court\u2019s\npermission, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\nSee Dukore, 799 F.3d at 1140.\n\n     In Blue, we held that, when a district court enters a partial\nfinal judgment as to some but not all parties, a would-be\nappellant cannot concoct finality by agreeing with the\nremaining defendants to dismiss the claims against them\nwithout prejudice, subject to an agreement that would allow\nrevival of those claims after the appeal. 764 F.3d at 14\u201315. As\na result, \u201cparty-initiated\u201d dismissals without prejudice are\n\u201cgenerally insufficient to render final and appealable a prior\norder disposing of only part of the case.\u201d Id. at 16\u201317. That\nprevents parties from \u201ctaking over the \u2018dispatcher\u2019 function\nthat [Rule 54(b)] vests in the trial judge to control the\ncircumstances and timing of the entry of final judgment.\u201d Blue,\n764 F.3d at 18 (quoting Robinson\u2013Reeder v. American Council\non Educ., 571 F.3d 1333, 1340 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). And\n\f                                12\nallowing parties to create their own superficial finality could\n\u201cgenerate overlapping lawsuits, piecemeal appeals, and\nsplintered and harassing litigation.\u201d Blue, 764 F.3d at 18.\n\n     Put simply, \u201c[p]arties cannot stipulate their way out of the\nfinal judgment rule or Rule 54(b)\u2019s strict limitations.\u201d Dukore,\n799 F.3d at 1141. It is the \u201cdistrict court, not the parties,\u201d that\nmust \u201ccontrol[] the terms of dismissal\u201d so as to prevent\n\u201cmanipulation of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction.\u201d Id.\n\n     The grant of summary judgment to the Palestinian\nDefendants in this case was a final, appealable judgment\nbecause the earlier dismissal of the Syrian Defendants was\nneither designed to nor had the effect when entered of turning\na partial judgment into an artificially final judgment for appeal.\nQuite the opposite, dismissal of the Syrian Defendants\noccurred twelve years before summary judgment issued. So\nthe voluntary dismissal plainly did not foreseeably operate to\nrender that long-into-the-future partial judgment final. Nor\nwas the voluntary dismissal meant to open the door to an\nappeal. Instead, its sole function was to allow for entry of a\ndefault judgment in favor of the Families. J.A. 158. Which the\nFamilies, of course, would not be appealing.\n\n    Also unlike Blue, the voluntary dismissal did not wrest\ncontrol of the litigation\u2019s finality out of the district court\u2019s\nhands. The Families filed two new lawsuits against the Syrian\nDefendants, alleging material support of terrorism under the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602 et seq.\nSee Shatsky v. Syrian Arab Republic, No. 1:06-cv-00724-RJL\n(D.D.C.); Shatsky v. Syrian Arab Republic, No. 1:08-cv-00496-\nRJL (D.D.C). Both cases were assigned to the same district\njudge who presided over this ligation against the Palestinian\nDefendants. Importantly, the district court has remained in\ncontrol of all three cases\u2019 management and progress, eventually\n\f                                 13\ndeciding to put the lawsuits against the Syrian Defendants on\nhold pending disposition of this case. J.A. 284\u2013285. So the\ndistrict court has had the full authority to keep the cases linked\nif it desired. Instead, the district court exercised its broad\ndiscretion to keep the cases separate, and to make the case\nagainst the Palestinian Defendants the lead one.\n\n     The district court\u2019s intent to conclusively resolve the\nlitigation is also a \u201csignificant factor in the [finality] analysis.\u201d\nAttias v. Carefirst, Inc., 865 F.3d 620, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\nHere, the district court signaled that its summary judgment\norder was final and appealable\u2014and need not await disposition\nof the Syrian Defendants\u2019 case\u2014by ordering that \u201cjudgment is\nentered for the defendants.\u201d J.A. 116. If more were needed,\nthe district court described the Families\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion to\nalter or amend the judgment as seeking \u201cpost-judgment\nrelief[.]\u201d Shatsky, 292 F. Supp. 3d at 192, 195.\n\n     What all of that means is that Blue\u2019s fundamental concern\nabout parties manufacturing superficial finality while hijacking\nthe district court\u2019s control over final resolution of the litigation\nis not a factor in this case. The voluntary dismissal of the\nSyrian Defendants neither was intended to nor had the effect of\ncreating an appealable final judgment. And importantly, the\ndistrict court \u201calone determined when the case was over and its\norder became final,\u201d and so \u201cfulfilled its function as\n\u2018gatekeeper for the court of appeals.\u2019\u201d Dukore, 799 F.3d at\n1142 (quoting Blue, 764 F.3d at 18).\n\n                                 B\n\n     The Palestinian Defendants contend otherwise, arguing\nthat this case and the claims against the Syrian Defendants are\n\u201ca \u2018single judicial unit\u2019 for purposes of appellate jurisdiction\u201d\nbecause of their \u201cunified origin and substantial factual and\n\f                               14\nlegal overlap[.]\u201d Palestinian Defendants\u2019 Br. 4 (quoting Sears,\nRoebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 438 (1956)).\n\n     That argument might work if the district court had\nconsolidated the cases and \u201ctreat[ed] them\u201d such that \u201cthey\n[became] one case for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d\nBlackman, 456 F.3d at 174 n.9 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But that is not the path the district court chose. It\nchose instead to allow the cases to \u201cretain[] their separate\nidentities,\u201d id., and to proceed on separate procedural paths.\nWhen that happens in consolidated cases, a judgment as to all\nof the claims and parties in one of the cases can be considered\nfinal under Section 1291 despite the consolidation. See id.\nCertainly if not all consolidated cases count as a single unit for\ndetermining appellate jurisdiction, then neither should cases\nthat the district court formally keeps separate.\n\n    Nor does the presence of Doe defendants named in the\ncomplaint pose an obstacle to finality. Those defendants were\nnever served, and there is no indication that the district court\n\u201cforesees further proceedings on unresolved claims\u201d against\nthem. See Kaplan v. Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of\nIran, 896 F.3d 501, 506\u2013507 (D.C. Cir. 2018).\n\n    The long and the short of it is that, \u201c[a]bsent appellate\nreversal, the federal action [before the district court] is\nconcluded with nothing left to be done.\u201d Dukore, 799 F.3d at\n1141\u20131142. The judgment is final for purposes of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1291, giving us appellate jurisdiction.\n\n                               III\n\n     Determining the finality of the district court\u2019s judgment\ndoes not end our jurisdictional inquiry. The Palestinian\nDefendants argue that the grant of summary judgment can be\naffirmed on the ground that the district court lacked personal\n\f                               15\njurisdiction over them. That question of personal jurisdiction\nmust be resolved \u201cbefore reaching the merits[.]\u201d Kaplan, 896\nF.3d at 511.\n\n     The Families responded to the Palestinian Defendants\u2019\npersonal jurisdiction argument on the merits, without making\nany argument that the issue was not properly before us in the\nabsence of a cross-appeal. A month later, the Families changed\ncourse, filing a letter under Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 28(j) arguing that the absence of a cross-appeal\ndeprives this court of jurisdiction to consider the Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 personal jurisdiction argument. The Palestinian\nDefendants respond that the cross-appeal requirement is not\njurisdictional, and that the Families forfeited their procedural\nobjection by failing to raise it in their reply brief.\n\n     After navigating through the parties\u2019 competing\nprocedural objections, we hold that the Palestinian Defendants\nproperly preserved their objection to personal jurisdiction in\ndistrict court, and that circuit precedent squarely forecloses the\ndistrict court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction.\n\n                                A\n\n                                1\n\n     Parties who win in the district court may advance\n\u201calternative bases for affirmance\u201d that are properly raised and\nsupported by the record without filing a cross-appeal, even if\nthe district court rejected the argument. Crocker v. Piedmont\nAviation, Inc., 49 F.3d 735, 741 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see also\nJennings v. Stephens, 135 S. Ct. 793, 798 (2015) (\u201cAn appellee\nwho does not take a cross-appeal may \u2018urge in support of a\ndecree any matter appearing in the record, although his\nargument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the\nlower court.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United States v. American Ry. Express\n\f                               16\nCo., 265 U.S. 425, 435 (1924)); Ark Initiative v. Tidwell, 816\nF.3d 119, 127 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\n     But parties seeking to press arguments that would change\nor modify the district court\u2019s judgment to their benefit must\ncross-appeal. See Jennings, 135 S. Ct. at 798; see also Singh v.\nGeorge Washington Univ. Sch. of Med. & Health Sciences, 508\nF.3d 1097, 1099\u20131100 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (noting that a party\n\u201cneed not have\u201d cross-appealed because \u201cit sought no change\nin the final judgment in its favor\u201d); cf. Northwest Airlines,\nInc. v. County of Kent, 510 U.S. 355, 364 (1994) (\u201cA cross-\npetition [for certiorari] is required * * * when the respondent\nseeks to alter the judgment below.\u201d).\n\n     When, as in this case, the district court rejects a\ndefendant\u2019s claim that the court lacks personal jurisdiction, but\nthen rules in the defendant\u2019s favor on the merits, the defendant\ngenerally must take a cross-appeal to preserve the personal\njurisdiction objection. See Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899\nF.2d 24, 32\u201333 (D.C. Cir. 1990). That is so for two reasons.\n\n     First, personal jurisdiction is a \u201cforum objection,\u201d and so\ncan be forfeited \u201cat any stage of a proceeding[,]\u201d including by\nfailing to challenge the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction\non appeal. Spann, 899 F.2d at 32\u201333.\n\n    Second, if we conclude that the district court lacked\npersonal jurisdiction, we must vacate\u2014not affirm\u2014its\njudgment on the merits. See Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortg.\nCorp., 137 S. Ct 553, 562 (2017) (\u201cA court must have the\npower to decide the claim before it (subject-matter jurisdiction)\nand power over the parties before it (personal jurisdiction)\nbefore it can resolve a case.\u201d); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 41(b)\n(providing that a dismissal \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d does not\n\u201coperate[] as an adjudication on the merits\u201d).\n\f                               17\n     In addition, vacatur tends to \u201cenlarg[e] [the prevailing\nparty\u2019s] rights\u201d or \u201clessen[] the rights of [its] adversary[,]\u201d\nJennings, 135 S. Ct. at 798, particularly when the defendant is\na repeat player. Cf. Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 701\u2013703\n(2011) (recognizing that a party who prevails on the bottom\nline may have enough of a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d to challenge an\nadverse ruling the court made along the way). Vacatur for lack\nof jurisdiction would also deprive any unfavorable aspects of\nthe district court\u2019s decision of preclusive effect. See California\nCommunities Against Toxics v. EPA, 928 F.3d 1041, 1051\u2013\n1052 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (claim and issue preclusion apply only\nwhen the prior case was before \u201ca court of competent\njurisdiction\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     This case illustrates the concern. The Palestinian\nDefendants have long argued that they cannot be haled into a\ncourt of the United States to answer the Families\u2019 allegations.\nGiven the choice between (i) a preclusive determination that\nsuch litigation cannot proceed at all, and (ii) a preclusive\ndetermination that they can be forced to answer in court but\nthat, as it happens, they are not liable in a particular case, the\nPalestinian Defendants have ample reason to prefer and are\nmore broadly benefited by the former. See Kasap v. Folger\nNolan Fleming & Douglas, Inc., 166 F.3d 1243, 1248 (D.C.\nCir. 1999) (noting that, \u201cunder principles of issue preclusion,\u201d\ndismissals for lack of jurisdiction have \u201cpreclusive effect on the\njurisdictional issue litigated\u201d).\n\n     Put another way, affirmance and vacatur both mean that\nthe Palestinian Defendants owe the Families nothing in this\ncase. But vacatur would have the added effect of wiping the\ndistrict court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction off the books,\nwhile also precluding any repeat of the litigation unless the\njurisdictional situation changes. So vacatur is a modification\n\f                                18\nof the judgment that would provide an added benefit to the\nPalestinian Defendants.\n\n     The Palestinian Defendants point to Gilmore v.\nPalestinian Interim Self-Government Authority, 843 F.3d 958\n(D.C. Cir. 2016), in which this court addressed a personal\njurisdiction argument as an alternative ground for affirmance\nwithout questioning that description or the lack of a cross-\nappeal, see id. at 963\u2013964. But there was no need to address\nthose issues in Gilmore because we rejected the personal\njurisdiction argument as forfeited. See id.\n\n     For those reasons, the Palestinian Defendants were\nrequired to file a cross-appeal to preserve their challenge to the\ndistrict court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction. But as it turns\nout, their failure to do so is not fatal.\n\n                                2\n\n     The cross-appeal rule is \u201cunwritten but longstanding[.]\u201d\nGreenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 244 (2008). Yet\nunlike an original notice of appeal, \u201ca cross-appeal is not a\njurisdictional requirement.\u201d Spann, 899 F.2d at 33. That said,\nwe will excuse compliance with the cross-appeal rule only in\n\u201cexceptional circumstances[.]\u201d Id. at 31\u201333 (excusing the\ndefendant\u2019s failure to file a cross-appeal where it \u201cplainly\nintended to preserve\u201d its argument, but was reasonably\nconfused about the timeliness of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal).\n\n      Considering all the circumstances of this case in light of\nthe purposes of the cross-appeal rule, we conclude that there\nare exceptional circumstances warranting our consideration of\nthe personal jurisdiction issue. The cross-appeal rule protects\ntwo distinct sets of interests: (i) the opposing party\u2019s interests\nin notice and an adequate opportunity to brief the issue, and\n(ii) the structural interests in a full adversarial presentation of\n\f                                  19\nissues designed to unsettle a district court ruling and the finality\nof judgments. See Greenlaw, 554 U.S. at 243\u2013244 (describing\nthe cross-appeal rule as \u201cboth informed by, and illustrative of,\nthe party presentation principle[,]\u201d meaning that courts \u201crely\non the parties to frame the issues for decision\u201d); id. at 252\n(noting that the rule serves \u201cthe interests of the parties and the\nlegal system in fair notice and finality\u201d).3 In this case, both\nfactors weigh in favor of entertaining the Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 personal jurisdiction argument.\n\n     First, the Families forfeited any objection based on lack of\nnotice or prejudice to their interests by addressing the personal\njurisdiction argument on the merits in their reply brief, without\nany procedural complaint. They did not raise the cross-appeal\nissue until a post-briefing Rule 28(j) letter, which \u201ccomes too\nlate.\u201d Worldwide Moving & Storage, Inc. v. District of\nColumbia, 445 F.3d 422, 427 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2006); see\nWilliams v. Romarm, SA, 756 F.3d 777, 787 (D.C. Cir. 2014)\n(\u201c[T]he 28(j) process should not be employed as a second\nopportunity to brief an issue not raised in the initial briefs.\u201d).\nNor have they ever claimed prejudice from the Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 timing.\n\n     Second, the structural interests served by the cross-appeal\nrule are only weakly implicated here. The rule serves the\ncourt\u2019s interest in a full adversarial presentation of those\narguments that seek to deprive the district court\u2019s judgment of\nfinality by affording the parties additional opportunities to\nmake their arguments about the issues relevant to the cross-\nappeal. See FED. R. APP. P. 28.1 (providing for higher word\n\n     3\n       See also El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U.S. 473,\n481\u2013482 (1999) (The rule \u201cis meant to protect institutional interests\nin the orderly functioning of the judicial system, by putting opposing\nparties and appellate courts on notice of the issues to be litigated and\nencouraging repose of those that are not.\u201d).\n\f                                 20\nlimits and a fourth brief in cross-appeal cases); compare FED.\nR. APP. P. 32(a)(7)(B) (ordinary briefing format), with FED. R.\nAPP. P. 28.1(c) & (e)(2) (cross-appeal briefing format).\n\n     The additional airing of the issues that the cross-appeal\nprocess enables would not have been helpful here. For starters,\nthe personal jurisdiction issue was fully litigated in the district\ncourt, both as to the court\u2019s finding of forfeiture and the\nunderlying merits. The Palestinian Defendants raised the issue\nin a motion to dismiss, two motions for reconsideration, and in\nsupplemental briefing on their summary judgment motion. The\nFamilies responded each time. And although the district court\nnever reduced its reasoning on the merits to writing, it twice\nexplained the forfeiture ruling.\n\n     The parties also adequately briefed the personal\njurisdiction issue on appeal, again addressing both forfeiture\nand the merits.\n\n     As for the ultimate merits, there was little for the parties to\nsay or for this court to resolve. The Families and the\nPalestinian Defendants agree that existing circuit precedent\ndirectly controls the result. See Palestinian Defendants\u2019\nBr. 19\u201320, 23\u201326; Families\u2019 Reply Br. 12 & n.2; see also\nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 56\u201357; Estate of Klieman ex rel. Kesner v.\nPalestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1123\u20131126 (D.C. Cir. 2019),\npetition for cert. filed, No. 19-741 (U.S. Dec. 5, 2019).\n\n     All that is really in dispute is the district court\u2019s forfeiture\nruling. That is the type of \u201cstraightforward legal question\u201d that\nsatisfies the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d requirement when,\nas here, \u201cboth parties have fully addressed the issue on appeal\u201d\nand in district court. Lesesne v. Doe, 712 F.3d 584, 588 (D.C.\nCir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f                                21\n     The interest in finality also has little force in this unique\ncontext, given the parties\u2019 full presentation of the issue before\nthe district court and that court\u2019s awareness of our decision in\nLivnat v. Palestinian Authority, which all agree, in the absence\nof forfeiture, dictates a finding of no personal jurisdiction in\nthis case. For those reasons, this case does not implicate\nconcerns about sandbagging the district court that would\nordinarily weigh against entertaining a belatedly raised\npersonal jurisdiction argument. See Peterson v. Highland\nMusic, Inc., 140 F.3d 1313, 1318 (9th Cir. 1998) (suggesting\nthat \u201cdeliberate, strategic behavior\u201d like \u201csandbagging\u201d could\njustify a finding that a defendant forfeited its objection to\npersonal jurisdiction). The most that a notice of cross-appeal\nwould have offered is that the Families would have learned\nslightly sooner that one additional component of the\njudgment\u2014beyond the 33 orders already identified in their\nnotice of appeal\u2014was in play.\n\n     In sum, the Families forfeited their interest in the cross-\nappeal rule; the structural interests that rule ordinarily protects\nare near their nadir here; and the parties both agree that the\npersonal jurisdiction question is controlled by binding circuit\nprecedent of which the district court was fully aware. For those\nreasons, exceptional circumstances excuse the Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 failure to cross-appeal the question of personal\njurisdiction.\n\n                                B\n\n     With the issue properly before us, we review for an abuse\nof discretion the district court\u2019s finding that the Palestinian\nDefendants forfeited their objection to personal jurisdiction.\nSee Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1120\u20131123. \u201cA district court abuses\nits discretion when it applies the wrong legal standard or relies\non clearly erroneous findings of fact.\u201d Amador County v.\n\f                               22\nUnited States Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 772 F.3d 901, 903 (D.C.\nCir. 2014). \u201cA district court by definition abuses its discretion\nwhen it makes an error of law.\u201d Koon v. United States, 518\nU.S. 81, 100 (1996). We conclude that the district court abused\nits discretion in holding that the Palestinian Defendants\nforfeited their objection to the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nin this case.\n\n                                1\n\n     While subject-matter jurisdiction is a mandatory\nprerequisite for a federal court to act, the requirement that the\ncourt have personal jurisdiction over a defendant is a personal\nright that a defendant can choose to assert or not. Insurance\nCorp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456\nU.S. 694, 702\u2013704 (1982). That means that a personal\njurisdiction defense is both forfeitable and waivable. Sickle v.\nTorres Advanced Enter. Sols., LLC, 884 F.3d 338, 344 (D.C.\nCir. 2018).\n\n    A defendant forfeits its objection to personal jurisdiction\nunless it raises the issue in a pre-answer Rule 12 motion or in\na responsive pleading. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(h)(1); see also\nGilmore, 843 F.3d at 964. It is undisputed that the Palestinian\nDefendants complied with that initial obligation by raising their\npersonal jurisdiction defense in their pre-answer, pre-default\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n     The question is whether the Palestinian Defendants\u2019\nconduct after the entry of default amounted to forfeiture. It did\nnot.\n\n     To be sure, properly raising an objection to personal\njurisdiction at the outset of the case did not immunize the\nPalestinian Defendants against later forfeiting that objection by\ntheir conduct. That is because objections to personal\n\f                               23\njurisdiction \u201ccan be waived at any stage of a proceeding.\u201d\nSpann, 899 F.2d at 32\u201333. But simply pleading the absence of\npersonal jurisdiction is not all that happened here. The\nPalestinian Defendants also raised personal jurisdiction in a\nmotion to dismiss at the outset of the case and litigated it fully\nbefore the district court, which considered and rejected the\npersonal jurisdiction challenge. And when the Palestinian\nDefendants asked for a written explanation of the ruling, the\ncourt denied that too. At that point, nothing in the law required\nthe Palestinian Defendants to continue beating a dead horse.\nInstead, they could turn to \u201cdefend[ing] on the merits in the\ndistrict court without losing [their] right to press on direct\nreview the jurisdictional objection, along with objections on\nthe merits.\u201d Practical Concepts, Inc. v. Republic of Bolivia,\n811 F.2d 1543, 1547 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\n     In other words, once the issue is litigated to resolution in\nthe district court, a defendant\u2019s pivot to defending on the merits\nby itself is an insufficient basis for inferring abandonment of a\npersonal jurisdiction challenge. Instead, the district court\nwould need to predicate a finding of forfeiture on specific\nactions later taken by the defendant that are inconsistent with\nthe good-faith preservation of the defense, such as intentional\nsandbagging or an express and unambiguous renunciation of\nthe claim. See Peterson, 140 F.3d at 1317\u20131319; Brownlow v.\nAman, 740 F.2d 1476, 1483 n.1 (10th Cir. 1984) (holding that\nmoving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction preserves\nthe issue for appeal).\n\n    In finding forfeiture, the district court trained its analysis\non the Palestinian Defendants\u2019 post-default litigation. The\ncourt emphasized, in particular, the Palestinian Defendants\u2019\nrepresentation in seeking vacatur of the default that they were\nnow committed to litigating the case on the merits. J.A. 301\n(\u201c[T]hese defendants, in asking the Court to vacate their\n\f                               24\nintentional default, informed this Court of their \u2018seriousness\u2019\nand the \u2018good faith\u2019 with which they intended to litigate their\n\u2018strong meritorious defenses.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Memorandum in\nSupport of Palestinian Defendants\u2019 Motion to Vacate Clerk\u2019s\nEntry of Default, supra, at 5, J.A. 176; and quoting id. at 40,\nJ.A. 211). Against that backdrop, the district court reasoned\nthat defendants who \u201chave participated in litigation for a\nlengthy period of time and have sought affirmative relief from\nthe [c]ourt\u201d have, in so doing, \u201cmanifested their consent to the\n[c]ourt\u2019s jurisdiction through their conduct,\u201d and have forfeited\ntheir personal jurisdiction defense. J.A. 301.\n\n     Applying that rule, the district court concluded that even\nthough the Palestinian Defendants included personal\njurisdiction as an affirmative defense in their answer, they\nabandoned that objection and consented to the court\u2019s\njurisdiction by first seeking vacatur of the default with a\npromise to defend on the merits, and then moving for summary\njudgment \u201cwithout including a challenge to personal\njurisdiction\u201d in the motion. J.A. 301.\n\n    The district court was correct that a defendant cannot\npreserve a personal jurisdiction defense by just raising it in an\nanswer, proceeding to engage in substantial litigation on the\nmerits without teeing up the personal jurisdiction issue in a\nmotion, and then resurrecting the defense only after the case\ntakes an unfavorable turn on the merits. It would, after all, be\n\u201cperverse\u201d to allow defendants to \u201cask[] the court to proceed\non the merits, and then, only if the court\u2019s decision is\nunfavorable, seek[] to re-assert jurisdictional defenses.\u201d\nBoulger v. Woods, 917 F.3d 471, 477\u2013478 (6th Cir. 2019).\n\n     But what happened procedurally in this case is materially\ndifferent. The Palestinian Defendants did more than just flag\npersonal jurisdiction as a defense in their answer. They\n\f                                25\nproperly filed a motion to dismiss on that basis, fully litigated\nit, and lost before the district court. The Palestinian Defendants\nthen followed up with a request that the district court explain\nthe basis for its minute-order rejection of their personal\njurisdiction defense. Once the district court declined, the\nPalestinian Defendants got the clear message that the court was\nfinished adjudicating that issue.\n\n     It was in that specific context that the Palestinian\nDefendants shifted at the default stage and \u201ccommitted to\nlitigating the case on the merits,\u201d \u201crather than continuing to rely\nexclusively on jurisdictional defenses.\u201d           J.A. 182\u2013183\n(emphasis added; formatting modified). Hewing to our\ndecision in Practical Concepts, the Palestinian Defendants\nchose not to stand on their jurisdictional objection alone and\ndefault, but instead to defend on the merits, preserving the\nalready-decided jurisdictional issue for appeal, see 811 F.2d at\n1547.\n\n     Even still, the Palestinian Defendants took additional steps\nto alert the district court and the Families that they maintained\ntheir personal jurisdiction objection.          The Palestinian\nDefendants included personal jurisdiction as an affirmative\ndefense in their answer, which was filed along with the motion\nto vacate the default. Answer at 2, Shatsky, No. 1:02-cv-\n02280-RJL (D.D.C. Dec. 21, 2007), ECF No. 77-10. And the\nmotion to vacate advised that, while now focused on addressing\nthe merits, the Palestinian Defendants were not \u201cwaiving any\nof the defenses raised in the verified answer.\u201d J.A. 205. In\nother words, the Palestinian Defendants embraced the agree-\nto-disagree approach authorized by Practical Concepts.\n\n     Underscoring their efforts to preserve their personal\njurisdiction defense, once the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nDaimler armed them with favorable intervening authority, the\n\f                                  26\nPalestinian Defendants renewed their personal jurisdiction\nargument. When they did not prevail in that round, they moved\nfor reconsideration or authorization of an interlocutory appeal\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).\n\n     True, the Palestinian Defendants did not raise personal\njurisdiction in their summary judgment motion. It would have\nbeen better and fairer to the district court and the Families if\nthey had. But the Palestinian Defendants did request\nreconsideration of the personal jurisdiction ruling in their\nsupplemental summary judgment briefing after a favorable\nSecond Circuit decision issued, and they had earlier renewed\ntheir objection following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nDaimler.\n\n     That pattern documents that the Palestinian Defendants\ntook sufficient steps to preserve their personal jurisdiction\ndefense. While changing their focus to the merits out of respect\nfor the apparent definitiveness of the district court\u2019s adverse\nruling, they preserved the argument in their answer and twice\nrevived the argument when new authority might have justified\nrevisiting an otherwise settled question.4\n\n   The district court read our decision in Democratic\nRepublic of Congo v. FG Hemisphere Associates, LLC, 508\n\n     4\n       See Aly v. Hanzada for Import & Export Co., 864 F.3d 844,\n847\u2013848 (8th Cir. 2017) (after losing motion to dismiss, defendant\npreserved personal jurisdiction objection by raising it in its answer,\neven though it was omitted from the defendant\u2019s summary judgment\nmotion); Peterson, 140 F.3d at 1317\u20131319 (defendants did not forfeit\ntheir personal jurisdiction defense by failing to raise it in a summary\njudgment motion, at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case at trial, or in a\npost-trial motion because the defendants had already moved to\ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, lost that motion, and filed\nan answer preserving the defense).\n\f                                27\nF.3d 1062 (D.C. Cir. 2007), as holding that personal\njurisdiction is forfeited \u201cwhere a defendant has engaged in\nextensive post-default litigation without suggesting an\ninfirmity in personal jurisdiction[.]\u201d J.A. 300 (quoting\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, 508 F.3d at 1064). That is true.\nBut that case involved a defendant\u2019s failure to raise a personal\njurisdiction objection at all until late in the litigation. As we\nexplained, \u201cdefendants should raise [personal jurisdiction]\nbefore the court\u2019s and parties\u2019 time is consumed in struggle\nover the substance of the suit[.]\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\n     In so holding, Democratic Republic of Congo simply\njoined a long line of precedent holding that defendants cannot\nraise personal jurisdiction for the very first time after the\nlitigation is well underway. See Manchester Knitted Fashions,\nInc. v. Amalgamated Cotton Garment & Allied Indus. Fund,\n967 F.2d 688, 691\u2013692 (1st Cir. 1992) (defendant litigated a\ntemporary restraining order for about three months before\ncontesting venue for the first time in its answer); Trustees of\nCentral Laborers\u2019 Welfare Fund v. Lowery, 924 F.2d 731, 732\n(7th Cir. 1991) (defendants first raised defective service after\nsix years of post-default judgment proceedings); Marcial Ucin,\nS.A. v. SS Galicia, 723 F.2d 994, 997 (1st Cir. 1983) (defendant\nappeared, attended thirteen depositions, and then raised its\npersonal jurisdiction defense for the first time in a motion to\ndismiss filed four years after its appearance).\n\n     At bottom, the district court misstepped when it analyzed\nforfeiture starting at the middle rather than the beginning of the\nlitigation. That led it to apply the wrong legal standard\u2014one\nthat applies to defendants who do not raise personal jurisdiction\nat all until after extensive litigation. Here, the Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 full litigation of the issue at the outset of the case,\npreservation of the defense in their answer, and efforts twice to\n\f                                 28\nseek post-default reconsideration of the district court\u2019s adverse\nruling sufficed to preserve the claim.\n\n                                 2\n\n    The Families\u2019 three arguments in support of forfeiture fail.\n\n     First, the Families argue that the Palestinian Defendants\u2019\npersonal jurisdiction defense was forfeited because the way\nthey litigated after the default gave the Families \u201ca reasonable\nexpectation that [they would] defend the suit on the merits,\u201d\nand they \u201ccause[d] the court to go to some effort that would be\nwasted if personal jurisdiction is subsequently found lacking.\u201d\nFamilies\u2019 Reply Br. 5 (quoting Hedeen Int\u2019l, LLC v. Zing Toys,\nInc., 811 F.3d 904, 906 (7th Cir. 2016)).\n\n      That argument repeats the district court\u2019s error: Courts\nthat apply the Families\u2019 test or a similar one do so to determine\nwhether a defendant waited too long to press \u201cthe issue by\nmotion[,]\u201d as opposed to merely pleading it as an affirmative\ndefense and otherwise standing silent. See King v. Taylor, 694\nF.3d 650, 660\u2013661 (6th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (defendant forfeited his service defense by including\nit in his answer, participating in the litigation for more than a\nyear, and only then raising it at the summary judgment stage);\nsee also Boulger, 917 F.3d at 477 (applying the \u201creasonable\nexpectation\u201d test where the defendant had pleaded personal\njurisdiction as an affirmative defense but had not raised it in a\nmotion); Hedeen, 811 F.3d at 906 (addressing the timeliness of\nan initial challenge to personal jurisdiction).5\n\n\n    5\n      See also H-D Michigan, LLC v. Hellenic Duty Free Shops S.A.,\n694 F.3d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 2012) (\u201c[A] party may appear and litigate\nboth a personal jurisdiction defense and the merits of a case without\nwaiving the personal jurisdiction defense[.]\u201d); Hamilton v. Atlas\n\f                                 29\n     Second, the Families argue for a categorical rule under\nwhich a defendant forfeits its personal jurisdiction defense\nwhenever it \u201cfiles a dispositive motion on the merits without\nmentioning its jurisdictional defense.\u201d Families\u2019 Reply Br. 6.\nBut none of the cases the Families cite for that rule involved\ndefendants who had already litigated and lost the personal\njurisdiction issue. See Boulger, 917 F.3d at 477 (no earlier\nmotion raising jurisdictional defense); CalMat Co. v. Oldcastle\nPrecast, Inc., No. 16-26 KG/WPL, 2016 WL 9776555, at *2\u2013\n3 (D.N.M. Oct. 5, 2016) (same); Casares v. Agri-Placements\nInt\u2019l, Inc., 12 F. Supp. 3d 956, 966 (S.D. Tex. 2014) (same).\nWe have found no such case either. Nor do the Families\nexplain why such a rigid rule of perpetual relitigation should\nbe imposed even after a personal jurisdiction defense has been\nfully litigated and rejected in district court.\n\n     Third, relying on Bouchet v. National Urban League, Inc.,\n730 F.2d 799 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the Families contend that the\nPalestinian Defendants were required to renew their motion to\ndismiss after the district court vacated the default because the\n\u201cmotion was denied by minute order, which did not create \u2018law\nof the case,\u2019\u201d Families\u2019 Reply Br. 10. Bouchet actually proves\nthe opposite. That case held that a minute order created law of\nthe case on the issue it \u201cnecessarily decided,\u201d but not on a \u201cnew\nissue\u201d that arose later. Id. at 806. So the problem was not that\nminute orders are unable to create law of the case, but that the\nlaw-of-the-case doctrine is triggered only when an issue is\n\u201cexpressly addressed\u201d or \u201cmust have been decided by\n\n\n\nTurner, Inc., 197 F.3d 58, 62\u201363 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding forfeiture\nwhere the defendant pleaded the defense, but then participated in\npretrial proceedings for four years without moving to dismiss for lack\nof personal jurisdiction); Continental Bank, N.A. v. Meyer, 10 F.3d\n1293, 1296\u20131297 (7th Cir. 1993) (similar).\n\f                                   30\nnecessary implication[.]\u201d          Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).6\n\n     Anyhow, it would make little sense to evaluate a\ndefendant\u2019s diligence in advancing its personal jurisdiction\ndefense based on whether the district court explains itself.\nAfter all, \u201cany order or other decision, however designated,\u201d\nthat does not resolve all claims against all parties and that the\ndistrict court does not make final under Rule 54(b) \u201cmay be\nrevised at any time before the entry of a [final] judgment[.]\u201d\nFED. R. CIV. P. 54(b) (emphasis added). So a minute order is\nopen to reconsideration on the same terms as a lengthy opinion\nreaching the same result.\n\n     For all of those reasons, we hold that the Palestinian\nDefendants properly preserved their objection to the court\u2019s\nexercise of personal jurisdiction for appellate review, and the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in holding otherwise.7\n\n                                   C\n\n     The easiest part of this case is the actual merits of the\nPalestinian Defendants\u2019 objection to personal jurisdiction. We\nreview de novo \u201cthe district court\u2019s assertion of personal\njurisdiction[.]\u201d In re Sealed Case, 932 F.3d 915, 922 (D.C. Cir.\n2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). And as the Families\n     6\n       Although minute orders bind the parties and can create law of\nthe case, their weight on appeal is necessarily diminished because we\nare deprived of any insight as to why the district court ruled as it did.\n     7\n       This case does not present, and so we do not decide, the\nquestion whether a district court\u2019s entry of a default judgment, see\nFED. R. CIV. P. 55(b)\u2014as opposed to the Clerk\u2019s entry of default as\noccurred here, see FED. R. CIV. P. 55(a)\u2014would require more\nvigorous efforts on the part of a defendant to preserve a personal\njurisdiction argument.\n\f                               31\nadmit, binding circuit precedent answers the question in the\nPalestinian Defendants\u2019 favor.\n\n     There are two forms of personal jurisdiction: \u201cgeneral or\nall-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or conduct-linked\njurisdiction.\u201d Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1119 (quoting Daimler,\n571 U.S. at 122). \u201cA court may assert general jurisdiction over\nforeign corporations to hear any and all claims against them\nwhen their affiliations with the forum are so continuous and\nsystematic as to render them essentially at home in the forum.\u201d\nId. at 1120 (quoting Daimler, 571 U.S. at 127) (formatting\nmodified). \u201c[A]bsent exceptional circumstances,\u201d that means\n\u201cgeneral jurisdiction will lie only where an entity is formally\nincorporated or maintains its principal place of business.\u201d Id.\n\n     Specific jurisdiction, by contrast, requires \u201ca relationship\namong \u2018the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u2019\u201d\nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1120 (quoting Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S.\n277, 291 (2014)). Put another way, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s suit-\nrelated conduct must create a substantial connection with the\nforum.\u201d Id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting Walden, 571 U.S. at\n284).\n\n                               1\n\n     The Palestinian Authority and the PLO are not subject to\ngeneral jurisdiction because neither one is \u201cat home\u201d in the\nDistrict of Columbia within the meaning of Daimler. See 571\nU.S. at 139. Livnat was explicit that, because the Palestinian\nAuthority\u2019s \u201cheadquarters, officials, and primary activities are\nall in the West Bank,\u201d it is \u201cnot subject to general jurisdiction\nin the United States.\u201d 851 F.3d at 56. In Klieman, we\nreaffirmed that holding as to the Palestinian Authority and\nextended it to the PLO. 923 F.3d at 1123.\n\f                                32\n    Klieman also forecloses any argument that either the\nPalestinian Authority or the PLO could be deemed to have\nconsented to jurisdiction, within the meaning of the Anti-\nTerrorism Clarification Act of 2018.8 The Anti-Terrorism\nClarification Act treated \u201ccertain conduct\u201d by defendants as\nconsent to general personal jurisdiction, Klieman, 923 F.3d at\n1127, such as receiving certain forms of foreign aid, or\nestablishing or maintaining an \u201coffice, headquarters, premises,\nor other facilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of\nthe United States\u201d while \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or\nsuspension\u201d of the Anti-Terrorism Act\u2019s prohibitions regarding\nthe PLO. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1) (2018) (citing 22 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 5202).\n\n     Klieman held that neither the Palestinian Authority nor the\nPLO satisfied any of the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act\u2019s\nfactual predicates for consent to jurisdiction. See 923 F.3d at\n1128\u20131130. Because the Families concede that Klieman\ncontrols and have not come forth with any evidence that the\nfacts pertaining to consent have changed in the interim, the\nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act does not provide a basis for\nexercising general personal jurisdiction over either the\nPalestinian Authority or the PLO.\n\n                                 2\n\n     Binding circuit precedent likewise forecloses the exercise\nof specific personal jurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority\nand the PLO. The Families argued in district court that specific\njurisdiction existed because (i) the Palestinian Authority and\nthe PLO provided material support for terrorism as part of a\n\n    8\n      Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4(a), 132 Stat. 3183, 3184 (codified at\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)), repealed by Promoting Security and Justice for\nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019, H.R. 1865, 116th Cong., div. J,\n\u00a7 903 (enacted Dec. 20, 2019).\n\f                                33\npublic relations campaign designed to influence the United\nStates\u2019 policy toward Israel, and (ii) it was foreseeable that the\nbombing would injure United States citizens because it took\nplace in a neighborhood that visitors and emigrants from the\nUnited States were known to frequent.\n\n     Livnat rejected that same public-relations theory because\nthe plaintiffs there \u201cfailed to link th[e] particular attack to the\nalleged plan to influence opinion and policy in the United\nStates.\u201d 851 F.3d at 56\u201357; see Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1124\n(\u201cLivnat\u2019s logic governs here.\u201d). The link missing in those\ncases is absent here too. The Families do not identify any\nevidence in the record connecting the Karnei Shomron\nbombing to the alleged public relations campaign.\n\n     Klieman similarly puts the kibosh on the jurisdictional\ntheory that the area was frequented by Americans. Klieman\nruled that evidence of \u201cintentional targeting\u201d of Americans or\nsome other form of \u201cintentional conduct by the defendant\u201d is\nneeded to \u201ccreate[] the necessary contacts with the forum.\u201d Id.\nat 1126 (quoting Walden, 571 U.S. at 286). The Families have\ncome forward with no such evidence.\n\n                                3\n\n    Livnat and Klieman would have been the end of the\npersonal jurisdiction story in this case but for an intervening\nAct of Congress. Three months after oral argument, Congress\nenacted the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of\nTerrorism Act of 2019, H.R. 1865, 116th Cong., div. J, \u00a7 903\n(enacted Dec. 20, 2019) (\u201cJustice for Victims Act\u201d).\n\n    As relevant here, the Justice for Victims Act provides that\nthe Palestinian Authority and the PLO specifically \u201cshall be\ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in any Anti-\nTerrorism Act suit if they make certain types of payments to\n\f                                 34\nterrorists or their families \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d after April 18,\n2020. H.R. 1865, 116th Cong., div. J, \u00a7 903(c)(1)(A) (to be\ncodified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)).\n\n     The Justice for Victims Act applies retroactively to \u201cany\ncase pending on or after August 30, 2016,\u201d H.R. 1865,\n\u00a7 903(d)(2), \u201cregardless of the date of the occurrence of the act\nof international terrorism\u201d at issue, id. \u00a7 903(c)(1)(A) (to be\ncodified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)).\n\n     The Families argue that, after April 18, 2020, the\nPalestinian Defendants might make the types of payments\ncovered by the Justice for Victims Act and, in so doing, trigger\nretroactive consent to personal jurisdiction. On that basis, they\nrequest that this court remand the case to the district court to\naddress the implications of this new statute in the first instance.\n\n    The Palestinian Defendants dismiss that suggestion as\nspeculative because they might never make covered payments.\n\n     The Palestinian Defendants are correct. Perhaps the\nJustice for Victims Act will at some point create personal\njurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority or the PLO. But\nneither one of them can possibly have made any statutorily\nrelevant payments before the jurisdictional trigger even takes\neffect. The mere prospect that they might do so in the future\ndoes not create personal jurisdiction now. Cf. Timbisha\nShoshone Tribe v. Salazar, 678 F.3d 935, 937\u2013939 (D.C. Cir.\n2012) (ordering dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because the\nplaintiffs lacked standing to sue on behalf of their Tribe,\ndespite pending litigation that might lead to their recognition\nas the Tribe\u2019s leadership).\n\n    Because the Palestinian Defendants are not now and were\nnot at the time they were served subject to the district court\u2019s\npersonal jurisdiction, this case must be dismissed without\n\f                               35\nprejudice. See Caribbean Broad. Sys., Ltd. v. Cable & Wireless\nP.L.C., 148 F.3d 1080, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (dismissals for\nlack of personal jurisdiction are without prejudice). That\ndismissal without prejudice would, of course, leave the\nFamilies free to refile if new facts establish personal\njurisdiction before the statute of limitations runs. See Dozier v.\nFord Motor Co., 702 F.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C.

They contend that the Palestinian\nDefendants facilitated the bombing by providing financial\nsupport to the Popular Front. Specifically, they accuse the\nPalestinian Defendants of (i) paying the alleged mastermind,\nRa\u2019ed Nazal, a salary for a no-show job; (ii) covering some of\nthe Popular Front\u2019s necessary expenses, including rent for its\noffice in the nearby city Qalqilya, and (iii) providing what the\nFamilies call \u201cmartyr payments\u201d to Nazal\u2019s and Hafez\u2019s\nfamilies after their deaths.

The\ncase started when the Families filed their complaint in\nNovember 2002 and served the Palestinian Defendants in July\n2003.\n\n    Two months later, the Syrian Defendants and the\nPalestinian Defendants jointly moved for a protective order to\nprevent the Families from moving forward with depositions\nbefore the defendants\u2019 \u201csovereign and governmental\nimmunity[] and other defenses\u201d could be litigated.\nDefendants\u2019 Motion for Protective Order at 1\u20132, Shatsky,\nNo. 1:02-cv-02280-RJL (D.D.C. Sept. 11. 2003), ECF No. 14.\n\f                               5\nThat same day, the Clerk of the Court entered a default against\nthe Palestinian Defendants under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 55(a) because they had not responded to the\ncomplaint by what the Families asserted was the deadline. By\nway of explanation, Rule 55(a) requires the Clerk to enter a\ndefault when a defendant \u201chas failed to plead or otherwise\ndefend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise[.]\u201d\nFED. R. CIV. P. 55(a). Once the Clerk does so, the plaintiff may\n\u201capply to the court for a default judgment\u201d under Rule 55(b).\nFED. R. CIV. P. 55(b)(2).\n\n    The Palestinian Defendants then moved to strike that\ndefault and requested additional time to respond to the\ncomplaint. While those motions were still pending, the\nPalestinian Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b), asserting among other\nthings sovereign and governmental immunity and lack of\npersonal jurisdiction. As for personal jurisdiction, the\nPalestinian Defendants argued that they lacked the minimum\ncontacts with the United States that the Due Process Clause\nrequires. They explained that their only contacts with the\nUnited States were the activities of Palestine\u2019s Mission to the\nUnited Nations and its ambassador in New York. The\nPalestinian Defendants argued that those diplomatic contacts\nwere \u201cgovernment contacts\u201d that could not provide a basis for\npersonal jurisdiction. J.A. 147\u2013148.\n\n    On June 23, 2004, the district court entered minute orders\ngranting the motions for a protective order and to strike the\nentry of default.\n\n    Eight months later, the district court denied the Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in a minute order that provided\nno reasoning. At a status hearing the next month, the\nPalestinian Defendants requested an explanation, but the\n\f                                 6\ndistrict court declined to provide one. The Palestinian\nDefendants then informed the court that they planned to rest\ntheir defense entirely on jurisdiction and were contemplating\nan interlocutory appeal.\n\n     The Palestinian Defendants, however, never took an\ninterlocutory appeal. After the Palestinian Defendants failed to\nfile an answer or otherwise participate in the litigation, the\nClerk of the Court entered a second default against them on\nApril 12, 2005.\n\n    The next month, the Families voluntarily dismissed their\nclaims against the Syrian Defendants without prejudice.1\n\n     On January 31, 2006, the Palestinian Defendants informed\nthe district court that they had new political leadership and\nsought a stay until May 1, 2006 to allow the new government\nto decide how to handle the litigation. The district court denied\nthe motion as moot in a May 30, 2006 minute order.\n\n     Almost a year later, the Families asked the court to enter a\ndefault judgment against the Palestinian Defendants under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b). In their brief opposing\nthe motion, the Palestinian Defendants reasserted their personal\njurisdiction argument: \u201cFor the reasons presented in their\nMotion to Dismiss and supporting memorandum, the\n[Palestinian Defendants] continue to contend that they have\ninsufficient contacts with the United States to warrant the\nCourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over them and reserve\nthat issue.\u201d J.A. 161 (citation omitted).\n\n\n    1\n       A plaintiff may \u201cdismiss an action without a court order by\nfiling * * * a notice of dismissal\u201d so long as the opposing party has\nnot yet \u201cserve[d] either an answer or a motion for summary\njudgment[.]\u201d FED.

They moved to vacate the Clerk\u2019s entry of\ndefault, emphasizing that they were now \u201ccommitted to\nlitigating the case on the merits.\u201d J.A. 182 (formatting\nmodified). The Palestinian Defendants explained that, earlier\nin the litigation, they \u201cmight rightly have wondered why they\nwould be haled into U.S. courts to litigate claims\u201d that arose\nabroad \u201cagainst the backdrop of the Palestinian\u2013Israeli\nconflict.\u201d J.A. 183. But they told the court that they \u201cha[d]\ncome to appreciate that they need to address these cases head\non, rather than continuing to rely exclusively on jurisdictional\ndefenses.\u201d J.A. 183.\n\n     At the same time, the Palestinian Defendants filed an\nanswer that both responded to the merits of the complaint\u2019s\nallegations and, as relevant here, raised lack of personal\njurisdiction as an affirmative defense. The Palestinian\nDefendants\u2019 brief in support of vacating the default \u201cconfined\ntheir discussion\u201d of the \u201cmeritorious defense\u201d requirement for\nvacatur \u201cto [the Palestinian Defendants\u2019] lack of\nresponsibility\u201d for the bombing.

The\ncourt emphasized, in particular, the Palestinian Defendants\u2019\nrepresentation in seeking vacatur of the default that they were\nnow committed to litigating the case on the merits. J.A. 301\n(\u201c[T]hese defendants, in asking the Court to vacate their\n\f                               24\nintentional default, informed this Court of their \u2018seriousness\u2019\nand the \u2018good faith\u2019 with which they intended to litigate their\n\u2018strong meritorious defenses.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Memorandum in\nSupport of Palestinian Defendants\u2019 Motion to Vacate Clerk\u2019s\nEntry of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Default,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">5</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, J.A. 176; and quoting</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span></span> at 40,\n</span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">J.A. 211). Against that backdrop, the district court reasoned\nthat defendants who \u201chave participated in litigation for a\nlengthy period of time and have sought affirmative relief from\nthe [c]ourt\u201d have, in so doing, \u201cmanifested their consent to the\n[c]ourt\u2019s jurisdiction through their conduct,\u201d and have forfeited\ntheir personal jurisdiction defense. J.A. 301.\n\n     Applying that rule, the district court concluded that even\nthough the Palestinian Defendants included personal\njurisdiction as an affirmative defense in their answer, they\nabandoned that objection and consented to the court\u2019s\njurisdiction by first seeking vacatur of the default with a\npromise to defend on the merits, and then moving for summary\njudgment \u201cwithout including a challenge to personal\njurisdiction\u201d in the motion. J.A. 301.\n\n    The district court was correct that a defendant cannot\npreserve a personal jurisdiction defense by just raising it in an\nanswer, proceeding to engage in substantial litigation on the\nmerits without teeing up the personal jurisdiction issue in a\nmotion, and then resurrecting the defense only after the case\ntakes an unfavorable turn on the merits. It would, after all, be\n\u201cperverse\u201d to allow defendants to \u201cask[] the court to proceed\non the merits, and then, only if the court\u2019s decision is\nunfavorable, seek[] to re-assert jurisdictional defenses.\u201d\nBoulger v.

The Palestinian Defendants did more than just flag\npersonal jurisdiction as a defense in their answer. They\n\f                                25\nproperly filed a motion to dismiss on that basis, fully litigated\nit, and lost before the district court. The Palestinian Defendants\nthen followed up with a request that the district court explain\nthe basis for its minute-order rejection of their personal\njurisdiction defense. Once the district court declined, the\nPalestinian Defendants got the clear message that the court was\nfinished adjudicating that issue.\n\n     It was in that specific context that the Palestinian\nDefendants shifted at the default stage and \u201ccommitted to\nlitigating the case on the merits,\u201d \u201crather than continuing to rely\nexclusively on jurisdictional defenses.\u201d           J.A. 182\u2013183\n(emphasis added; formatting modified). Hewing to our\ndecision in Practical Concepts, the Palestinian Defendants\nchose not to stand on their jurisdictional objection alone and\ndefault, but instead to defend on the merits, preserving the\nalready-decided jurisdictional issue for appeal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483527\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> <a href=\"/opinion/483527/practical-concepts-inc-v-republic-of-bolivia/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at\n<span class=\"page\">1547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     Even still, the Palestinian Defendants took additional steps\nto alert the district court and the Families that they maintained\ntheir personal jurisdiction objection.          The Palestinian\nDefendants included personal jurisdiction as an affirmative\ndefense in their answer, which was filed along with the motion\nto vacate the default. Answer at 2, Shatsky, No. 1:02-cv-\n02280-RJL (D.D.C. Dec. 21, 2007), ECF No. 77-10. And the\nmotion to vacate advised that, while now focused on addressing\nthe merits, the Palestinian Defendants were not \u201cwaiving any\nof the defenses raised in the verified answer.\u201d J.A. 205. In\nother words, the Palestinian Defendants embraced the agree-\nto-disagree approach authorized by Practical Concepts.\n\n     Underscoring their efforts to preserve their personal\njurisdiction defense, once the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nDaimler armed them with favorable intervening authority, the\n\f                                  26\nPalestinian Defendants renewed their personal jurisdiction\nargument. When they did not prevail in that round, they moved\nfor reconsideration or authorization of an interlocutory appeal\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).\n\n     True, the Palestinian Defendants did not raise personal\njurisdiction in their summary judgment motion. It would have\nbeen better and fairer to the district court and the Families if\nthey had. But the Palestinian Defendants did request\nreconsideration of the personal jurisdiction ruling in their\nsupplemental summary judgment briefing after a favorable\nSecond Circuit decision issued, and they had earlier renewed\ntheir objection following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nDaimler.\n\n     That pattern documents that the Palestinian Defendants\ntook sufficient steps to preserve their personal jurisdiction\ndefense. While changing their focus to the merits out of respect\nfor the apparent definitiveness of the district court\u2019s adverse\nruling, they preserved the argument in their answer and twice\nrevived the argument when new authority might have justified\nrevisiting an otherwise settled question.4\n\n   The district court read our decision in Democratic\nRepublic of Congo v.

Three months after oral argument, Congress\nenacted the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of\nTerrorism Act of 2019, H.R. 1865, 116th Cong., div. J, \u00a7 903\n(enacted Dec. 20, 2019) (\u201cJustice for Victims Act\u201d).\n\n    As relevant here, the Justice for Victims Act provides that\nthe Palestinian Authority and the PLO specifically \u201cshall be\ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in any Anti-\nTerrorism Act suit if they make certain types of payments to\n\f                                 34\nterrorists or their families \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d after April 18,\n2020.

On that basis, they\nrequest that this court remand the case to the district court to\naddress the implications of this new statute in the first instance.\n\n    The Palestinian Defendants dismiss that suggestion as\nspeculative because they might never make covered payments.\n\n     The Palestinian Defendants are correct. Perhaps the\nJustice for Victims Act will at some point create personal\njurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority or the PLO. But\nneither one of them can possibly have made any statutorily\nrelevant payments before the jurisdictional trigger even takes\neffect. The mere prospect that they might do so in the future\ndoes not create personal jurisdiction now. Cf. Timbisha\nShoshone Tribe v.

No. RM2017-1 (P.R.C. Jan. 3, 2019)\n(\u201cOrder\u201d), reprinted in Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) 515-712. The\ndisputed Order modifies Commission regulations that are\nmeant to \u201censure that all [of the Postal Service\u2019s] competitive\nproducts collectively cover what the Commission determines\nto be an appropriate share of the institutional costs of the Postal\nService.\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(a)(3). In making this \u201cappropriate\nshare\u201d determination under \u00a7 3633(a)(3), the Commission is\nobligated to \u201cconsider,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe degree to\nwhich any costs are uniquely or disproportionately associated\nwith any competitive products.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3633(b). However, the\nCommission concluded that \u201cthere are no costs uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products that\nare not already attributed to those products under the\nCommission\u2019s current cost attribution methodology\u201d under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(2). Order at 28, J.A. 547.\n\n     The problem is that \u00a7 3633(a)(2) only requires the\nCommission to \u201censure that each competitive product covers\nits costs attributable.\u201d The term costs attributable is narrowly\ndefined as \u201cthe direct and indirect postal costs attributable to [a\n\f                               3\nparticular competitive] product through reliably identified\ncausal relationships.\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3631(b). However, it is not\nat all clear that \u201cuniquely or disproportionately associated\u201d\ncosts described under \u00a7 3633(b) include only those costs that\nare attributable \u201cthrough reliably identified causal\nrelationships.\u201d And \u00a7 3633(b) makes it clear that \u201cthe\nCommission shall consider . . . the degree to which any costs\nare uniquely or disproportionately associated with any\ncompetitive products.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3633(b) (emphasis added). The\nCommission\u2019s Order fails to explain why these seemingly\ndistinct statutory phrases cover the same costs, and further\nelides the requirements of \u00a7 3633(a)(3) and (b) by suggesting\nthat, to the extent these statutory phrases overlap, the\nCommission need not consider costs under \u00a7 3633(b) if it\nalready accounted for them under \u00a7 3633(a)(2).\n\n     UPS argues that the Commission\u2019s position is contrary to\nlaw because \u201cthe Order fails to consider . . . costs \u2018uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with any competitive products,\u2019\nas the Act requires in section 3633(b).\u201d Br. for Petitioner at 3.\nUPS also contends that the Commission erred in simply\nassuming, without adequate explanation, that \u201cthere are no\ninstitutional costs uniquely or disproportionately associated\nwith competitive products.\u201d Id. We agree.\n\n     Two aspects of the Commission\u2019s Order require a remand.\nFirst, the Commission has not adequately explained how the\nstatutory phrases \u201cdirect and indirect postal costs attributable\nto [a particular competitive] product through reliably identified\ncausal relationships\u201d and \u201ccosts . . . uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with any competitive products\u201d\ncan coincide. It is far from clear that these phrases have the\nsame meaning. And the Commission has not demonstrated that,\nalthough they have distinct meanings, the phrases nonetheless\ncoincide in application. Second, in focusing on costs attributed\n\f                               4\nto competitive products under \u00a7 3633(a)(2), the Commission\nfailed to discharge its responsibility under \u00a7 3633(b) to\n\u201cconsider . . . the degree to which any costs are uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with any competitive products.\u201d\n39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(b) (emphasis added). The Commission must\nconsider any costs made relevant by \u00a7 3633(b). It does not\nmatter whether the Commission has arguably considered such\ncosts in implementing its responsibilities under \u00a7 3633(a)(2).\nThese two points are amplified in the opinion below.\n\n     The bottom line is that the Commission\u2019s Order is arbitrary\nand capricious because it is \u201clargely incomprehensible\u201d with\nrespect to the matters in issue. U.S. Postal Serv. v. PRC, 785\nF.3d 740, 753 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Therefore, we are constrained\nto remand the case for further consideration. On remand, the\nCommission must adhere to the commands of the statute and\naddress the costs specified in \u00a7 3633(b) in determining the\n\u201cappropriate share\u201d under \u00a7 3633(a)(3). Following\nreconsideration of this case, any Commission Order must be\ncoherent and transparent, and it must satisfy the requirements\nof reasoned and reasonable decision-making. Id. at 744, 753.\nThe present Order fails to meet these standards \u201cbecause it fails\nto articulate a comprehensible standard,\u201d id. at 753, regarding\nthe meaning and application of \u00a7 3633(a)(3) and (b).\n\n                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n   A. Statutory Background\n\n     The Postal Service offers both \u201cmarket dominant\u201d and\n\u201ccompetitive\u201d products. Market-dominant products, like first-\nclass mail, are \u201cthose over which the \u2018Postal Service exercises\nsufficient market power that it can effectively\u2019 raise prices or\ndecrease quality \u2018without risk of losing a significant level of\nbusiness to other firms offering similar products.\u2019\u201d UPS v.\n\f                               5\nPRC, 890 F.3d 1053, 1055 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting 39 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3642(b)(1)); see also 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621 (listing market-\ndominant products). Competitive products, on the other hand,\nlike priority mail or parcel post, are \u201cproducts over which the\nPostal Service faces meaningful market competition\u201d from\ncompanies like UPS. UPS v. PRC, 890 F.3d at 1056 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also 39 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3631 (listing competitive products).\n\n     In 2006, Congress enacted the Postal Accountability and\nEnhancement Act, Pub. L. No. 109-435, 120 Stat. 3198 (2006)\n(\u201cAccountability Act\u201d), to ensure (among other things) that the\nPostal Service offers its competitive products on fair terms. See\nS. REP. NO. 108-318, at 14-16 (2004). To that end, the\nAccountability Act requires the Commission to promulgate\nregulations that ensure that the Postal Service is not \u201cusing\nrevenues from market-dominant products subject to its\nmonopoly power to defray costs competitive products would\notherwise have to be priced to cover.\u201d UPS v. PRC, 890 F.3d\nat 1055.\n\n     Specifically, \u00a7 3633(a) requires the Commission to issue\nthree sets of regulations:\n\n    (a) In general.\u2014The Postal Regulatory Commission\n    shall, within 18 months after the date of enactment of\n    this section, promulgate (and may from time to time\n    thereafter revise) regulations to\u2014\n\n         (1) prohibit the subsidization of competitive\n             products by market-dominant products;\n\n         (2) ensure that each competitive product covers\n             its costs attributable; and\n\f                                6\n         (3) ensure that all competitive products\n             collectively cover what the Commission\n             determines to be an appropriate share of the\n             institutional costs of the Postal Service.\n\n39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(a)(1)-(3). As may be seen, the foregoing\nprovisions refer to \u201ccosts attributable\u201d and \u201cinstitutional costs.\u201d\nThese terms are important in our consideration of the issues\npresented in this case.\n\n      As explained in the introduction to this opinion, the\nAccountability Act defines the term \u201ccosts attributable\u201d as \u201cthe\ndirect and indirect postal costs attributable to [a particular\ncompetitive] product through reliably identified causal\nrelationships.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3631(b). The Commission, in turn,\ninterprets the term \u201cinstitutional costs\u201d to mean \u201cresidual costs\u201d\n\u2013 that is, the Postal Service\u2019s total costs minus its costs\nattributable under \u00a7 3633(a)(2). See UPS v. PRC, 890 F.3d at\n1055-56, 1061-63 (explaining the relationship between\n\u201cinstitutional costs\u201d and \u201ccosts attributable\u201d).\n\n     The Accountability Act calls for the Commission to\nperiodically review its \u201cappropriate share\u201d determination under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3). The statute also specifies that the Commission\n\u201cshall consider\u201d the following matters when it conducts that\nreview:\n\n    (b) Review of minimum contribution.\u2014Five years\n    after the date of enactment of this section, and every\n    5 years thereafter, the Postal Regulatory Commission\n    shall conduct a review to determine whether the\n    institutional costs contribution requirement under\n    subsection (a)(3) should be retained in its current\n    form, modified, or eliminated. In making its\n    determination, the Commission shall consider all\n\f                               7\n    relevant circumstances, including the prevailing\n    competitive conditions in the market, and the degree\n    to which any costs are uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with any competitive products.\n\n39 U.S.C \u00a7 3633(b).\n\n     In effect, then, the Accountability Act requires the\nCommission to establish a multi-part \u201cprice floor\u201d for its\ncompetitive products. See UPS v. PRC, 890 F.3d at 1055-56.\nFirst, the Commission must issue regulations to prevent\nmarket-dominant products from subsidizing competitive\nproducts. Second, the price of \u201ceach competitive product\u201d must\nbe set high enough to cover the \u201cdirect and indirect postal costs\nattributable to such product through reliably identified causal\nrelationships.\u201d Third, the Commission must also ensure that\n\u201call competitive products collectively\u201d cover what the\nCommission determines to be an \u201cappropriate share\u201d of the\nPostal Service\u2019s institutional (i.e., unattributed) costs. The\nCommission, in determining what share is appropriate, \u201cshall\nconsider,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe degree to which any costs\nare uniquely or disproportionately associated with any\ncompetitive products.\u201d\n\n   B. The Commission\u2019s             2016   Order     Addressing\n      \u00a7 3633(a)(2)\n\n    In 2016, the Commission issued an Order adopting a new\nmethod for calculating costs attributable under \u00a7 3633(a)(2).\nSee Order Concerning United Parcel Service, Inc.\u2019s Proposed\nChanges to Postal Service Costing Methodologies (UPS\nProposals One, Two, and Three), No. 3506, Dkt. No. RM2016-\n2 (P.R.C. Sept. 9, 2016) (updated Oct. 19, 2016) (\u201c2016\nOrder\u201d). UPS challenged this 2016 Order on various grounds.\nIn UPS v. PRC, 890 F.3d 1053 (D.C. Cir. 2018), we upheld the\n\f                                8\nCommission\u2019s cost-attribution method as \u201creasonable and\nreasonably explained.\u201d Id. at 1069. Because the court\u2019s 2018\ndecision thoroughly explains the Commission\u2019s cost-\nattribution method, the decision provides important context for\nthe questions at issue in this case.\n\n    First, the court\u2019s 2018 decision explains several concepts\nthat the Commission uses to sort out the Postal Service\u2019s costs.\nTo start, the decision explains that \u201cthe Commission\ndistinguishes (albeit necessarily imperfectly) between \u2018fixed\ncosts,\u2019 . . . which remain constant regardless of overall product\nvolume, and \u2018variable costs,\u2019 . . . which vary with the Service\u2019s\nproduction levels.\u201d Id. at 1056 (citing 2016 Order at 6).\nExamples of fixed costs include executive salaries and product-\nspecific fixed costs like advertising. See id. In addition, the\ndecision explains that the Commission distinguishes between\nvariable costs that are \u201cvolume-variable\u201d \u2013 i.e., which vary\ndirectly with the marginal cost of the cheapest relevant unit and\nthe total number of units, id. at 1057 (citing 2016 Order at 36\nn.56) \u2013 and variable costs that are not \u201cvolume-variable\u201d in this\nsense, which the Commission calls \u201cinframarginal costs,\u201d id. at\n1058 (citing 2016 Order at 35). The concept of inframarginal\ncosts is not entirely intuitive. The basic idea is that, thanks to\neconomies of scale, marginal costs tend to decrease with\nvolume, and the sum of the differences between the marginal\ncost of earlier, more expensive units and the marginal cost of\nthe last, cheapest unit is the inframarginal cost. See id. at 1057-\n58; 2016 Order at 35-36.\n\n    Second, the court\u2019s 2018 decision holds that the\nCommission\u2019s decision to define \u201cinstitutional costs\u201d as\n\u201cresidual costs\u201d \u2013 that is, as any costs not attributed to\ncompetitive products through reliably identified causal\nrelationships under \u00a7 3633(a)(2) \u2013 was based on a permissible\nreading of the Accountability Act. UPS v. PRC, 890 F.3d at\n\f                                9\n1061-63. An important upshot of the Commission\u2019s choice to\ntreat institutional costs as \u201cresidual\u201d is that the composition of\nthe Postal Service\u2019s institutional costs will (by definition)\ndepend on how attributed costs are calculated. For example, if\nthe Commission were to attribute to each competitive product\nits product-specific fixed costs and its volume-variable costs \u2013\nwhich is what the Commission did until 2016 \u2013 then the Postal\nService\u2019s institutional costs would include all its other fixed\ncosts and all of its inframarginal costs. See id. at 1056-58.\n\n     Third, the court\u2019s 2018 decision upholds the Commission\u2019s\nrevised method for attributing costs under \u00a7 3633(a)(2). See id.\nat 1066-69. In short, the Commission adopted a method that\nenables it to attribute product-specific fixed costs, volume-\nvariable costs, and some (but not all) inframarginal costs to\neach competitive product. See id. at 1060. The Commission is\nable to tie a portion of the Postal Service\u2019s inframarginal costs\nto specific competitive products through \u201creliably identified\ncausal relationships\u201d by calculating the \u201ccosts that would\ndisappear were the Postal Service to stop offering those\nproducts for sale.\u201d Id. at 1055. This \u201cincremental cost\u201d method\naccounts for not only a \u201cproduct\u2019s share of volume-variable\ncosts, but also the inframarginal costs that would be removed\nif the product were not to be provided.\u201d Id. at 1059 (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting 2016 Order App\u2019x A at 19).\nIn the Commission\u2019s view, \u201cbecause the portion of\ninframarginal costs included within a product\u2019s incremental\ncost has a causal relationship with that product, the\nAccountability Act requires the Postal Service to attribute it.\u201d\nId. at 1059-60 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n2016 Order at 55, 61). The court\u2019s 2018 decision finds the\nCommission\u2019s position reasonable and reasonably explained.\nId. at 1069.\n\f                               10\n     Fourth, the court\u2019s 2018 decision notes that the\nCommission\u2019s cautious cost-attribution method leaves some of\nthe Postal Service\u2019s inframarginal costs unattributed. See id. at\n1060 (\u201cAll other costs, including all remaining inframarginal\ncosts, remain classified as institutional.\u201d). Indeed, the decision\nconcludes that the Commission\u2019s caution was reasonable,\ngiven the Accountability Act\u2019s requirement that attributed\ncosts have \u201creliably identified causal relationships\u201d to\ncompetitive products. See id. at 1068. For example, the 2018\ndecision rejects the argument that the Commission\u2019s approach\nwas arbitrary and capricious for assuming that competitive\nproducts are responsible for only the lowest-cost units\nassociated with a given activity. The decision reasons that\n\u201c[a]ttributing more than this amount . . . necessitates\nguesswork, and the Commission sensibly concluded that such\nguesswork was inconsistent with its statutory obligation to base\nattribution on only \u2018reliably identified causal relationships.\u2019\u201d\nId. (quoting 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3631(b)).\n\n    It is clear, then, that the court\u2019s 2018 decision in UPS v.\nPRC upholding the Commission\u2019s cost-attribution method\nunder \u00a7 3633(a)(2) leaves open important questions that\nprovide context for understanding and assessing the\nCommission\u2019s \u00a7 3633(a)(3) determination in this case. These\nquestions include: Are some of the Postal Service\u2019s\ninstitutional costs \u2013 and especially its unattributed\ninframarginal costs \u2013 still related in some meaningful way to\ncompetitive products, even if those costs cannot be attributed\nunder \u00a7 3633(a)(2)? And if so \u2013 if, for instance, some of those\ninstitutional costs are \u201cuniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with competitive products,\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(b) \u2013\nmight they need to be accounted for when the Commission\nissues regulations under another provision of the\nAccountability Act?\n\f                                11\n    C. The Commission\u2019s Disputed Order in this Case\n\n    On January 3, 2019, the Commission issued the Order\nmodifying its \u201cappropriate share\u201d determination under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3) that is the subject of the dispute in this case. In the\npast, the Commission had determined that \u201call competitive\nproducts collectively\u201d must cover at least 5.5% of the Postal\nService\u2019s institutional costs. See Order at 4-5, J.A. 523-24\n(summarizing the Commission\u2019s 2007 and 2012 orders). In the\n2019 Order, however, the Commission decided that the\n\u201cappropriate share\u201d of the Postal Service\u2019s institutional costs to\nbe covered by \u201call competitive products collectively\u201d should\nbe set using a dynamic formula. In short, the Commission\u2019s\nformula relies on two primary variables: the \u201cCompetitive\nContribution Margin\u201d and the \u201cCompetitive Growth\nDifferential.\u201d These variables are meant to represent the Postal\nService\u2019s market power and market position. See id. at 19-28,\nJ.A. 538-47. The Commission intends to use the formula \u201cto\nannually update the appropriate share based on prevailing\ncompetitive conditions in the market and other relevant\ncircumstances.\u201d Id. at 19, J.A. 538.\n\n    For our purposes, however, the details of the Commission\u2019s\nformula-based approach are not critical. Instead, our focus in\nthis case is on whether the Commission, in making its\ndetermination, adequately discharged its obligation under\n\u00a7 3633(b) to \u201cconsider all relevant circumstances, including the\nprevailing competitive conditions in the market, and the degree\nto which any costs are uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with any competitive products.\u201d Therefore, this\nbackground section is similarly focused on the Commission\u2019s\n\u00a7 3633(b) analysis and in particular on the Commission\u2019s\n\u201cconsider[ation of] . . . the degree to which any costs are\nuniquely or disproportionately associated with any competitive\nproducts.\u201d\n\f                               12\n\n     In a section of its Order titled \u201cConnection to Section\n3633(b) Criteria,\u201d the Commission recited the factors that the\nAccountability Act says it \u201cshall consider,\u201d and then explained\nits position on costs \u201cuniquely or disproportionately associated\nwith\u201d competitive products:\n\n    The Commission has repeatedly found that there are\n    no costs uniquely or disproportionately associated\n    with competitive products that are not already\n    attributed to those products under the Commission\u2019s\n    current cost attribution methodology. As a result, the\n    formula-based approach does not separately account\n    for such costs.\n\nOrder at 28-29, J.A. 547-48 (citations omitted).\n\n      The Commission\u2019s conclusion draws on its analysis in\nearlier notices in the same docket. See Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking to Evaluate the Institutional Cost Contribution\nRequirement for Competitive Products, No. 4402, Dkt. No.\nRM2017-1 (P.R.C. Feb. 8, 2018) (\u201cInitial Notice\u201d); Revised\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, No. 4742, Dkt. No. RM2017-\n1 (P.R.C. Aug. 7, 2018) (\u201cRevised Notice\u201d). In its Initial\nNotice, for instance, the Commission offered an explanation of\nits thinking:\n\n        The Commission finds that there are no costs\n    uniquely or disproportionately associated with\n    competitive products that are not already attributed to\n    competitive products. Under the Commission\u2019s\n    methodology, any cost that is uniquely or\n    disproportionately associated with any competitive\n    product is identified as an attributable cost because it\n    exhibits a reliably identifiable causal relationship with\n\f                              13\n    a specific competitive product. With regard to costs\n    that are disproportionately associated with\n    competitive products, the Commission\u2019s cost\n    attribution methodology identifies relationships\n    between costs and cost drivers, which include mail\n    characteristics such as weight and shape (e.g., letters\n    or parcels). . . . In this way, the costs attributed to\n    products reflect any disproportionate association of\n    those costs with any specific products (including any\n    competitive products).\n\n        Under the Commission\u2019s methodology, the\n    Commission also classifies any cost that is uniquely\n    associated with any product (including any\n    competitive product) as attributable to that product.\n    These costs are often referred to as product-specific\n    costs. For example, advertisements for a specific\n    product and supplies for money orders are unique\n    costs attributed to specific products under the\n    Commission\u2019s methodology.\n\n         ....\n\n         For the reasons discussed above, the Commission\n    concludes that its costing methodology already\n    accounts for the \u201cthe degree to which any costs are\n    uniquely or disproportionately associated with any\n    competitive products.\u201d To the extent that any costs\n    can be attributed to specific competitive products,\n    they are already distributed under the Commission\u2019s\n    current costing methodology and are not included in\n    the institutional costs of the Postal Service.\n\nInitial Notice at 43-45, J.A. 147-49; see also Revised Notice at\n52-53, J.A. 304-05 (summarizing this same point).\n\f                                14\n\n    Later, in response to comments from UPS and others, the\nCommission provided a succinct summary of the position it\ntook in its Initial Notice. See Order at 138-162, J.A. 657-81.\n\n    In [the Initial Notice], the Commission found that\n    there are no costs uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with competitive products that are not\n    already attributed to those products. This is because\n    all costs that are uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with competitive products exhibit a\n    reliably identified causal relationship with a specific\n    competitive product or group of products and are\n    therefore attributed. The Commission described\n    \u201cunique\u201d costs as product-specific costs and\n    determined that any cost that is uniquely associated\n    with a competitive product is attributed to that product\n    through a reliably identified causal relationship. . . . In\n    addition, the Commission found that any cost\n    disproportionately associated with a competitive\n    product is attributed to that product through the cost\n    methodology\u2019s use of cost drivers. . . . In this way, the\n    costs attributed products reflect any disproportionate\n    association of those costs with specific products. As a\n    result, the Commission determined that both types of\n    costs are attributed to the competitive products that\n    cause them.\n\nOrder at 138-39, J.A. 657-58 (citing Initial Notice at 43-44).\n\n    Finally, in response to UPS\u2019s comment suggesting that the\nCommission\u2019s analysis mistakenly conflates the \u201cassociated\nwith\u201d standard and the \u201creliably identified causal relationships\u201d\nstandard, the Commission concluded that \u201cUPS overlooks key\nterms in section 3633(b), as well as the context of the statutory\n\f                               15\nscheme as a whole.\u201d Order at 143, J.A. 662. The Commission\nemphasized the \u201cdegree of flexibility . . . inherent in the\nappropriate share provisions of section 3633\u201d and the lack of\nany mechanical relationship between the Commission\u2019s\nconsideration of the statutory factors and the Commission\u2019s\nultimate determination. Id. at 144, J.A. 663. The Commission\ncontinued:\n\n         For the relevant factor at issue, \u201cthe degree to\n    which any costs are uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with any competitive products,\u201d UPS\n    focuses on only a portion of the statutory language\u2014\n    \u201cdisproportionately associated.\u201d However, in reading\n    the relevant factor in its entirety, the use of the words\n    \u201cdegree\u201d and \u201cany\u201d plainly contemplate that there\n    may be no uniquely or disproportionately associated\n    competitive product costs. Congress does not require\n    costs to be found; only for the Commission to\n    \u201cconsider\u201d whether \u201cany\u201d exist. Nothing in section\n    3633(b) prevents the Commission from concluding as\n    it has\u2014that all costs uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with competitive products are, in fact,\n    captured by the costing methodology it currently\n    employs pursuant to section 3633(a)(2).\n\nOrder at 144, J.A. 663.\n\n     In short, the Commission\u2019s position appears to be that the\nstatutory phrase \u201ccosts . . . uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with any competitive products\u201d is no broader than\nthe phrase \u201cdirect and indirect postal costs attributable to [a\nparticular competitive] product through reliably identified\ncausal relationships.\u201d And the Commission appears to base that\nconclusion on the assumption that costs are uniquely or\n\f                               16\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products only if\ncompetitive products can be reliably said to cause such costs.\n\n                         II. ANALYSIS\n\n   A. Standard of Review\n\n    \u201c\u2018Because the Congress expressly delegated to the\nCommission responsibility to implement [the Accountability\nAct], we review its interpretation\u2019 of that statute under the\nstandards enunciated in Chevron and its progeny.\u201d U.S. Postal\nServ. v. PRC, 785 F.3d 740, 750 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting U.S.\nPostal Serv. v. PRC, 640 F.3d 1263, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).\n\n    Under Chevron\u2019s First Step, if \u201cCongress has directly\n    spoken to the precise question at issue . . ., that is the\n    end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency,\n    must give effect to the unambiguously expressed\n    intent of Congress.\u201d If the statute is ambiguous,\n    Chevron\u2019s Second Step then requires us to consider\n    whether the Commission has acted pursuant to\n    delegated authority and, if so, whether its\n    interpretation of the statute is \u201cpermissible.\u201d\n\nU.S. Postal Serv. v. PRC, 785 F.3d at 750 (quoting Chevron\nU.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-\n43 (1984)). \u201cEven if the statute is ambiguous and does not\nforeclose the Commission\u2019s interpretation, however, the\nCommission\u2019s exercise of its authority must be \u2018reasonable and\nreasonably explained\u2019 in order to survive arbitrary and\ncapricious review under the Administrative Procedure Act.\nMfrs. Ry. Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 676 F.3d 1094, 1096\n(D.C. Cir. 2012).\u201d Id.; see also 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663 (incorporating\nAPA review under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706).\n\f                               17\n     In deciding whether the Commission\u2019s Order is arbitrary\nand capricious, we are \u201creluctan[t] to interfere with [the\nCommission\u2019s] reasoned judgments about technical questions\nwithin its area of expertise.\u201d UPS v. PRC, 890 F.3d 1053, 1066\n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\nAll. of Nonprofit Mailers v. PRC, 790 F.3d 186, 197 (D.C. Cir.\n2015)). At the same time, the Commission must adequately\n\u201cconsider\u201d all the factors that the Accountability Act makes\nrelevant, see Lindeen v. SEC, 825 F.3d 646, 657 (D.C. Cir.\n2016), and the Commission\u2019s decision-making must be\ncomprehensible, see U.S. Postal Serv. v. PRC, 785 F.3d 740,\n753 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Glob. Tel*Link v. FCC, 866 F.3d 397,\n413 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n\n   B. The Commission\u2019s Disputed Interpretation and\n      Application of \u00a7 3633(a)(3)\n\n    The dispositive question before the court in this case is\nwhether the Commission, in reviewing its appropriate share\ndetermination, adequately discharged its statutory obligation to\n\u201cconsider\u201d the \u201cdegree to which any costs are uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with any competitive products.\u201d\nWe hold that the Commission failed to do this and, therefore,\nwe are constrained to remand the case.\n\n     We do not mean to render any decision on what the\nappropriate share determination under \u00a7 3633(a)(3) should be.\nThat is for the Commission to determine in the first instance.\nAt this point, however, the Commission\u2019s interpretation and\napplication of \u00a7 3633(a)(3) and (b) are incomprehensible and,\nthus, unreasonable. No deference is due to the Commission\u2019s\ncurrent position because the disputed Order fails to apply the\nrelevant terms of the statute, and it offers no reasoned basis for\nthis failure.\n\f                              18\n     As detailed above, the Commission\u2019s position appears to\nbe that the term \u201ccosts . . . uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with any competitive products\u201d in \u00a7 3633(b) is no\nbroader than \u2013 and indeed may coincide with \u2013 the term \u201cdirect\nand indirect postal costs attributable to [a particular\ncompetitive] product through reliably identified causal\nrelationships,\u201d which defines \u201ccosts attributable\u201d in\n\u00a7 3633(a)(2). To reach that conclusion, the Commission\nassumed that \u201call costs that are uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with competitive products exhibit a reliably\nidentified causal relationship with a specific competitive\nproduct or group of products and are therefore attributed.\u201d\nOrder at 138, J.A. 657. The Commission thus reasons that none\nof the Postal Service\u2019s institutional costs \u2013 including,\napparently, its \u201cremaining inframarginal costs,\u201d UPS v. PRC,\n890 F.3d at 1060 \u2013 are uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with its competitive products in the sense intended\nin \u00a7 3633(b). This leads the Commission to conclude that there\nare no costs for it to \u201cconsider\u201d under \u00a7 3633(b). See, e.g.,\nOrder at 28-29, J.A. 547-48. The Commission\u2019s analysis defies\nreasoned decision-making.\n\n     As noted at the outset of this opinion, there are two\nsignificant problems with the Commission\u2019s position. First, the\nCommission has not adequately explained how the statutory\nphrases \u201cdirect and indirect postal costs attributable to [a\nparticular competitive] product through reliably identified\ncausal relationships,\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3631(b), and \u201ccosts . . .\nuniquely or disproportionately associated with any competitive\nproducts,\u201d id. \u00a7 3633(b), can effectively coincide. Second, in\nfocusing narrowly on costs attributed to competitive products\nunder \u00a7 3633(a)(2), the Commission failed to discharge its\nresponsibility under \u00a7 3633(b) to \u201cconsider . . . the degree to\nwhich any costs are uniquely or disproportionately associated\n\f                                19\nwith any competitive products.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3633(b) (emphasis\nadded). We elaborate on these points in turn.\n\n    1. The Commission\u2019s Interpretation of Costs \u201cUniquely\n       or Disproportionately Associated with Competitive\n       Products\u201d Under \u00a7 3633(b)\n\n      The Commission\u2019s current analysis of the relationship\nbetween costs \u201cattributed through reliably identified causal\nrelationships\u201d and costs \u201cuniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with\u201d is incomprehensible. In the passages from the\nCommission\u2019s Order reprinted above, the Commission\nassumes that the Postal Service\u2019s costs can be \u201cuniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with\u201d competitive products only\nif there is a reliably identified causal relationship between those\ncosts and competitive products. See Initial Notice at 43-44, J.A.\n147-48; Order at 138-39, 657-58. In its brief to this court and\nat oral argument, however, the Commission\u2019s counsel suggests\nthat the Commission gave the phrase \u201cuniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with\u201d a distinct interpretation,\nand only then proceeded to conclude that there are no costs in\nthat independent category that are not already attributed to\ncompetitive products under \u00a7 3633(a)(2). See Br. for\nRespondent at 29-32; Tr. of Oral Argument at 54-55. It is an\nunderstatement to say that one is hard-pressed to understand\nwhat the Commission means to say regarding the meaning of\n\u00a7 3633(b).\n\n     At this point, we cannot credit either one of the foregoing\ninterpretations of the Accountability Act. To start, the\nCommission cannot simply assume that the \u201cuniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with\u201d standard is subsumed by\nthe \u201creliably identified causal relationships\u201d standard. That\nwould impermissibly conflate the language of \u00a7 3633(a)(2) \u2013\nwhich incorporates the definition of \u201ccosts attributed\u201d from\n\f                                  20\n\u00a7 3631(b) \u2013 with the evidently distinct language of \u00a7 3633(b).\nSee BP Energy Co. v. FERC, 828 F.3d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir.\n2016) (\u201cEven under the most deferential standard, an agency\ncannot read statutory provisions out of existence but must\ninterpret statutes \u2018so that effect is given to all its provisions . . .\n[and] no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or\ninsignificant.\u2019\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Corley v.\nUnited States, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009))). Instead, the\nCommission must explain why these two statutory phrases\nhave the same practical reach despite the use of different\nlanguage.\n\n     As noted above, the Commission attempted to offer such\nan explanation in its brief to this court. The Commission\nbelatedly argues that it did not \u201cequate[]\u201d the two statutory\nphrases \u201cas an interpretative matter.\u201d Br. for Respondent at 34.\nRather, the Commission now contends that it gave independent\nmeaning to the statutory terms \u201cuniquely . . . associated with\u201d\nand \u201cdisproportionately associated with,\u201d using the ordinary\ntools of statutory interpretation. See id. at 29-34; Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 54-55. Then, according to counsel, the\nCommission concluded that \u201call \u2018uniquely associated\u2019 costs\nand all \u2018disproportionately associated\u2019 costs satisfy the\nCommission\u2019s independent definition of the \u2018costs attributable\u2019\nto a competitive product.\u201d Br. for Respondent at 31. This line\nof argument is hard to discern in what the Commission actually\nsaid, and it is somewhat hard to fathom on its own terms. But\nif that is the Commission's view, it must spell it out.\n\n    In any event, as things stand now, \u201cwe simply cannot\ncomprehend the [Commission\u2019s] reasoning\u201d about the meaning\nand application of \u00a7 3633(b). Glob. Tel*Link v. FCC, 866 F.3d\n397, 413 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Therefore, the Commission\u2019s Order\nis neither reasoned nor reasonable. \u201cAt its core, the\nCommission\u2019s Order is arbitrary and capricious because it fails\n\f                               21\nto articulate a comprehensible standard . . . .\u201d U.S. Postal Serv.\nv. PRC, 785 F.3d 740, 753 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \u201c[W]e owe no\ndeference to an agency determination that is \u2018largely\nincomprehensible.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Coburn v. McHugh, 679 F.3d\n924, 926 (D.C. Cir. 2012)). The bottom line is that the\nCommission has not adequately explained why the statutory\nphrases at issue here have similar meanings, nor has it\ndemonstrated that these statutory categories, even if distinct in\nmeaning, nevertheless coincide in application. Therefore, the\nCommission\u2019s application of \u00a7 3633(a)(3) and (b) was\narbitrary and capricious and must be remanded.\n\n    2. The Commission\u2019s Consideration of \u201cAny\u201d Such Costs\n       Under \u00a7 3633(b)\n\n      A second problem with the disputed Order is that, in\nfocusing its analysis on costs attributed to competitive products\nunder 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(a)(2), the Commission failed to\n\u201cconsider . . . the degree to which any costs are uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with any competitive products\u201d\nas required by 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(b). As the plain meaning of\nthat provision suggests, the Accountability Act clearly requires\nthe Commission to consider any costs uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products at the\ntime it reviews its appropriate share determination under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3). This includes, but is not limited to, any costs\nfitting that description that the Commission may have already\nconsidered when it promulgated regulations under \u00a7 3633(a)(1)\nor \u00a7 3633(a)(2).\n\n     The record in this case indicates that the Commission did\nnot follow this statutory mandate. Instead, the Commission,\nrelying on its inadequately explained interpretation of the\nAccountability Act, focused narrowly on the costs it had\nconsidered \u2013 and attributed \u2013 in promulgating regulations under\n\f                               22\n\u00a7 3633(a)(2). At oral argument, counsel for the Commission\nsuggested that by piecing together the Commission\u2019s responses\nto various comments, we could find that the Commission did\nindeed consider a broader class of costs. Tr. of Oral Argument\nat 75; see also Br. for Respondent at 35-38. Even assuming that\nis right, however, the Commission\u2019s Order does not make it\nclear or comprehensible, and we cannot fill in the blanks in the\nCommission\u2019s reasoning. The simple point here is that the\nCommission erred in concluding that it had discharged its\nresponsibility to consider any costs uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products by\nvirtue of the fact that it had already considered these costs when\nsetting the price floor under \u00a7 3633(a)(2).\n\n     An agency Order that is at odds with the requirements of\nthe applicable statute cannot survive judicial review. See, e.g.,\nMichigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2706 (2015). \u201cAn agency\u2019s\nfailure to consider and address during rulemaking \u2018an\nimportant aspect of the problem\u2019 renders its decision arbitrary\nand capricious. A \u2018statutorily mandated factor, by definition, is\nan important aspect of any issue before an administrative\nagency . . . .\u2019\u201d Mozilla Corp. v. FCC, 940 F.3d 1, 60 (D.C. Cir.\n2019) (per curiam) (first quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); then\nquoting Pub. Citizen v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 374\nF.3d 1209, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). On the record before us, the\nCommission\u2019s treatment of \u00a7 3633(b) cannot survive judicial\nreview. Therefore, we are constrained to remand the Order to\nthe Commission for further consideration.\n\n    On remand, the Commission must consider all costs\nuniquely or disproportionately associated with competitive\nproducts in setting the appropriate share, even if it has already\naccounted for those costs under \u00a7 3633(a)(1) and (a)(2).\n\f                              23\n     Furthermore, the Commission should fully address the\nissue left open in the court\u2019s 2018 decision in UPS v. PRC. The\ncourt in that decision recognized that, because the costs\nattributed test under \u00a7 3633(a)(2) is conservative, there may be\ninstitutional costs that are \u201cuniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with competitive products,\u201d even though they\ncannot be said to stand in \u201creliably identified causal\nrelationships\u201d with them. The Commission\u2019s Order in this case\ndoes not address this.\n\n     In addition, the Commission must explain the relevance (if\nany) of costs it may have considered in implementing\n\u00a7 3633(a)(1). At oral argument, counsel for the Commission\nsuggested that the Commission might not have to further\nconsider costs uniquely or disproportionately associated with\ncompetitive products under \u00a7 3633(b) because it had already\nconsidered them pursuant to \u00a7 3633(a)(1). Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 43-44, 48, 54-55. However, this possibility is\noffered as nothing more than a fleeting suggestion in the\nCommission\u2019s Order and its brief to the court. Compare Order\nat 144, J.A. 663, and Br. for Respondent at 19 (focusing only\non \u00a7 3633(a)(2)), with Order at 160 n.294, J.A. 679 n.294, and\nBr. for Respondent at 36 (mentioning the Commission\u2019s test\nunder \u00a7 3633(a)(1)). If this point is somehow critical to the\nCommission\u2019s analysis, the Commission must make that clear\nin the first instance. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80,\n94-95 (1943).\n\n     We do not mean for these examples to exhaust the issues\nthat the Commission must address on remand, only to illustrate\nsome of what a fuller \u201cconsider[ation]\u201d of the relevant costs\nwill involve.\n\n                             ***\n\f                               24\n    In sum, the Commission must address the issues\nhighlighted above before we can say whether its formula-based\napproach to determining the appropriate share under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3) is permissible and reasonable. On remand, the\nCommission might decide to revise its judgment regarding the\n\u201cappropriate share\u201d under \u00a7 3633(a)(3). Indeed, at oral\nargument, counsel for the Commission conceded that the\n\u201cfloor\u201d established under \u00a7 3633(a)(3) might need to be\nadjusted if the Commission found any costs uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products. Tr. of\nOral Argument at 49-50. It is also possible, however, that the\nCommission might decide against revising its bottom-line\njudgment, given the other factors the Commission must\nconsider under \u00a7 3633(b) and the latitude that the text affords\nthe Commission in making a final determination.\n\n     We take no position on this matter. It is not for this court\nto say that the Commission must account for costs in any\nspecific way under \u00a7 3633(b) or that the Commission must\nmake any particular \u201cappropriate share\u201d determination under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3). Rather, the judgment of the court is that, on\nremand, the Commission must consider all the costs referenced\nunder \u00a7 3633(b), as the Accountability Act clearly commands.\nAnd any decision that the Commission reaches regarding the\nmeaning and application of \u00a7 3633(b) in connection with the\n\u201cappropriate share\u201d determination under \u00a7 3633(a)(3) must be\nconsistent with the terms of the statute, must be\ncomprehensible, and must otherwise satisfy the requirements\nof reasoned decision-making.\n\n                       III.

The concept of inframarginal\ncosts is not entirely intuitive.

These\nquestions include: Are some of the Postal Service\u2019s\ninstitutional costs \u2013 and especially its unattributed\ninframarginal costs \u2013 still related in some meaningful way to\ncompetitive products, even if those costs cannot be attributed\nunder \u00a7 3633(a)(2)?

The Commission\u2019s Disputed Order in this Case\n\n    On January 3, 2019, the Commission issued the Order\nmodifying its \u201cappropriate share\u201d determination under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3) that is the subject of the dispute in this case. In the\npast, the Commission had determined that \u201call competitive\nproducts collectively\u201d must cover at least 5.5% of the Postal\nService\u2019s institutional costs. See Order at 4-5, J.A. 523-24\n(summarizing the Commission\u2019s 2007 and 2012 orders). In the\n2019 Order, however, the Commission decided that the\n\u201cappropriate share\u201d of the Postal Service\u2019s institutional costs to\nbe covered by \u201call competitive products collectively\u201d should\nbe set using a dynamic formula. In short, the Commission\u2019s\nformula relies on two primary variables: the \u201cCompetitive\nContribution Margin\u201d and the \u201cCompetitive Growth\nDifferential.\u201d These variables are meant to represent the Postal\nService\u2019s market power and market position. See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 19-28,\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">J.A. 538-47.

Instead, our focus in\nthis case is on whether the Commission, in making its\ndetermination, adequately discharged its obligation under\n\u00a7 3633(b) to \u201cconsider all relevant circumstances, including the\nprevailing competitive conditions in the market, and the degree\nto which any costs are uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with any competitive products.\u201d Therefore, this\nbackground section is similarly focused on the Commission\u2019s\n\u00a7 3633(b) analysis and in particular on the Commission\u2019s\n\u201cconsider[ation of] . . . the degree to which any costs are\nuniquely or disproportionately associated with any competitive\nproducts.\u201d\n\f                               12\n\n     In a section of its Order titled \u201cConnection to Section\n3633(b) Criteria,\u201d the Commission recited the factors that the\nAccountability Act says it \u201cshall consider,\u201d and then explained\nits position on costs \u201cuniquely or disproportionately associated\nwith\u201d competitive products:\n\n    The Commission has repeatedly found that there are\n    no costs uniquely or disproportionately associated\n    with competitive products that are not already\n    attributed to those products under the Commission\u2019s\n    current cost attribution methodology. As a result, the\n    formula-based approach does not separately account\n    for such costs.\n\nOrder at 28-29, J.A. 547-48 (citations omitted).\n\n      The Commission\u2019s conclusion draws on its analysis in\nearlier notices in the same docket. See Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking to Evaluate the Institutional Cost Contribution\nRequirement for Competitive Products, No. 4402, Dkt. No.\nRM2017-1 (P.R.C. Feb. 8, 2018) (\u201cInitial Notice\u201d); Revised\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, No. 4742, Dkt. No. RM2017-\n1 (P.R.C. Aug. 7, 2018) (\u201cRevised Notice\u201d). In its Initial\nNotice, for instance, the Commission offered an explanation of\nits thinking:\n\n        The Commission finds that there are no costs\n    uniquely or disproportionately associated with\n    competitive products that are not already attributed to\n    competitive products. Under the Commission\u2019s\n    methodology, any cost that is uniquely or\n    disproportionately associated with any competitive\n    product is identified as an attributable cost because it\n    exhibits a reliably identifiable causal relationship with\n\f                              13\n    a specific competitive product. With regard to costs\n    that are disproportionately associated with\n    competitive products, the Commission\u2019s cost\n    attribution methodology identifies relationships\n    between costs and cost drivers, which include mail\n    characteristics such as weight and shape (e.g., letters\n    or parcels). . . . In this way, the costs attributed to\n    products reflect any disproportionate association of\n    those costs with any specific products (including any\n    competitive products).\n\n        Under the Commission\u2019s methodology, the\n    Commission also classifies any cost that is uniquely\n    associated with any product (including any\n    competitive product) as attributable to that product.\n    These costs are often referred to as product-specific\n    costs. For example, advertisements for a specific\n    product and supplies for money orders are unique\n    costs attributed to specific products under the\n    Commission\u2019s methodology.\n\n         ....\n\n         For the reasons discussed above, the Commission\n    concludes that its costing methodology already\n    accounts for the \u201cthe degree to which any costs are\n    uniquely or disproportionately associated with any\n    competitive products.\u201d To the extent that any costs\n    can be attributed to specific competitive products,\n    they are already distributed under the Commission\u2019s\n    current costing methodology and are not included in\n    the institutional costs of the Postal Service.\n\nInitial Notice at 43-45, J.A. 147-49; see also Revised Notice at\n52-53, J.A. 304-05 (summarizing this same point).\n\f                                14\n\n    Later, in response to comments from UPS and others, the\nCommission provided a succinct summary of the position it\ntook in its Initial Notice. See Order at 138-162, J.A. 657-81.\n\n    In [the Initial Notice], the Commission found that\n    there are no costs uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with competitive products that are not\n    already attributed to those products. This is because\n    all costs that are uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with competitive products exhibit a\n    reliably identified causal relationship with a specific\n    competitive product or group of products and are\n    therefore attributed. The Commission described\n    \u201cunique\u201d costs as product-specific costs and\n    determined that any cost that is uniquely associated\n    with a competitive product is attributed to that product\n    through a reliably identified causal relationship. . . . In\n    addition, the Commission found that any cost\n    disproportionately associated with a competitive\n    product is attributed to that product through the cost\n    methodology\u2019s use of cost drivers. . . . In this way, the\n    costs attributed products reflect any disproportionate\n    association of those costs with specific products. As a\n    result, the Commission determined that both types of\n    costs are attributed to the competitive products that\n    cause them.\n\nOrder at 138-39, J.A. 657-58 (citing Initial Notice at 43-44).\n\n    Finally, in response to UPS\u2019s comment suggesting that the\nCommission\u2019s analysis mistakenly conflates the \u201cassociated\nwith\u201d standard and the \u201creliably identified causal relationships\u201d\nstandard, the Commission concluded that \u201cUPS overlooks key\nterms in section 3633(b), as well as the context of the statutory\n\f                               15\nscheme as a whole.\u201d Order at 143, J.A. 662. The Commission\nemphasized the \u201cdegree of flexibility . . . inherent in the\nappropriate share provisions of section 3633\u201d and the lack of\nany mechanical relationship between the Commission\u2019s\nconsideration of the statutory factors and the Commission\u2019s\nultimate determination.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 144, </span><pre class=\"inline\">J.A. 663. The Commission\ncontinued:\n\n         For the relevant factor at issue, \u201cthe degree to\n    which any costs are uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with any competitive products,\u201d UPS\n    focuses on only a portion of the statutory language\u2014\n    \u201cdisproportionately associated.\u201d However, in reading\n    the relevant factor in its entirety, the use of the words\n    \u201cdegree\u201d and \u201cany\u201d plainly contemplate that there\n    may be no uniquely or disproportionately associated\n    competitive product costs. Congress does not require\n    costs to be found; only for the Commission to\n    \u201cconsider\u201d whether \u201cany\u201d exist. Nothing in section\n    3633(b) prevents the Commission from concluding as\n    it has\u2014that all costs uniquely or disproportionately\n    associated with competitive products are, in fact,\n    captured by the costing methodology it currently\n    employs pursuant to section 3633(a)(2).\n\nOrder at 144, J.A. 663.\n\n     In short, the Commission\u2019s position appears to be that the\nstatutory phrase \u201ccosts . . . uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with any competitive products\u201d is no broader than\nthe phrase \u201cdirect and indirect postal costs attributable to [a\nparticular competitive] product through reliably identified\ncausal relationships.\u201d And the Commission appears to base that\nconclusion on the assumption that costs are uniquely or\n\f                               16\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products only if\ncompetitive products can be reliably said to cause such costs.\n\n                         II.

The Commission\u2019s Disputed Interpretation and\n      Application of \u00a7 3633(a)(3)\n\n    The dispositive question before the court in this case is\nwhether the Commission, in reviewing its appropriate share\ndetermination, adequately discharged its statutory obligation to\n\u201cconsider\u201d the \u201cdegree to which any costs are uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with any competitive products.\u201d\nWe hold that the Commission failed to do this and, therefore,\nwe are constrained to remand the case.\n\n     We do not mean to render any decision on what the\nappropriate share determination under \u00a7 3633(a)(3) should be.\nThat is for the Commission to determine in the first instance.\nAt this point, however, the Commission\u2019s interpretation and\napplication of \u00a7 3633(a)(3) and (b) are incomprehensible and,\nthus, unreasonable. No deference is due to the Commission\u2019s\ncurrent position because the disputed Order fails to apply the\nrelevant terms of the statute, and it offers no reasoned basis for\nthis failure.\n\f                              18\n     As detailed above, the Commission\u2019s position appears to\nbe that the term \u201ccosts . . . uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with any competitive products\u201d in \u00a7 3633(b) is no\nbroader than \u2013 and indeed may coincide with \u2013 the term \u201cdirect\nand indirect postal costs attributable to [a particular\ncompetitive] product through reliably identified causal\nrelationships,\u201d which defines \u201ccosts attributable\u201d in\n\u00a7 3633(a)(2). To reach that conclusion, the Commission\nassumed that \u201call costs that are uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with competitive products exhibit a reliably\nidentified causal relationship with a specific competitive\nproduct or group of products and are therefore attributed.\u201d\nOrder at 138, J.A. 657. The Commission thus reasons that none\nof the Postal Service\u2019s institutional costs \u2013 including,\napparently, its \u201cremaining inframarginal costs,\u201d UPS v. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">PRC,</span>\n<span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1060</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">\u2013 are uniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with its competitive products in the sense intended\nin \u00a7 3633(b). This leads the Commission to conclude that there\nare no costs for it to \u201cconsider\u201d under \u00a7 3633(b). See, e.g.,\nOrder at 28-29, J.A. 547-48. The Commission\u2019s analysis defies\nreasoned decision-making.\n\n     As noted at the outset of this opinion, there are two\nsignificant problems with the Commission\u2019s position. First, the\nCommission has not adequately explained how the statutory\nphrases \u201cdirect and indirect postal costs attributable to [a\nparticular competitive] product through reliably identified\ncausal relationships,\u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3631(b), and \u201ccosts . . .\nuniquely or disproportionately associated with any competitive\nproducts,\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \u00a7 3633(b), </span><pre class=\"inline\">can effectively coincide. Second, in\nfocusing narrowly on costs attributed to competitive products\nunder \u00a7 3633(a)(2), the Commission failed to discharge its\nresponsibility under \u00a7 3633(b) to \u201cconsider . . . the degree to\nwhich any costs are uniquely or disproportionately associated\n\f                                19\nwith any competitive products.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span> \u00a7 3633(b) </span><pre class=\"inline\"></span><pre class=\"inline\">(emphasis\nadded). We elaborate on these points in turn.\n\n    1. The Commission\u2019s Interpretation of Costs \u201cUniquely\n       or Disproportionately Associated with Competitive\n       Products\u201d Under \u00a7 3633(b)\n\n      The Commission\u2019s current analysis of the relationship\nbetween costs \u201cattributed through reliably identified causal\nrelationships\u201d and costs \u201cuniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with\u201d is incomprehensible. In the passages from the\nCommission\u2019s Order reprinted above, the Commission\nassumes that the Postal Service\u2019s costs can be \u201cuniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with\u201d competitive products only\nif there is a reliably identified causal relationship between those\ncosts and competitive products. See Initial Notice at 43-44, J.A.\n147-48; Order at 138-39, 657-58. In its brief to this court and\nat oral argument, however, the Commission\u2019s counsel suggests\nthat the Commission gave the phrase \u201cuniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with\u201d a distinct interpretation,\nand only then proceeded to conclude that there are no costs in\nthat independent category that are not already attributed to\ncompetitive products under \u00a7 3633(a)(2). See Br. for\nRespondent at 29-32; Tr. of Oral Argument at 54-55. It is an\nunderstatement to say that one is hard-pressed to understand\nwhat the Commission means to say regarding the meaning of\n\u00a7 3633(b).\n\n     At this point, we cannot credit either one of the foregoing\ninterpretations of the Accountability Act. To start, the\nCommission cannot simply assume that the \u201cuniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with\u201d standard is subsumed by\nthe \u201creliably identified causal relationships\u201d standard. That\nwould impermissibly conflate the language of \u00a7 3633(a)(2) \u2013\nwhich incorporates the definition of \u201ccosts attributed\u201d from\n\f                                  20\n\u00a7 3631(b) \u2013 with the evidently distinct language of \u00a7 3633(b).\nSee BP Energy Co. v.

The bottom line is that the\nCommission has not adequately explained why the statutory\nphrases at issue here have similar meanings, nor has it\ndemonstrated that these statutory categories, even if distinct in\nmeaning, nevertheless coincide in application. Therefore, the\nCommission\u2019s application of \u00a7 3633(a)(3) and (b) was\narbitrary and capricious and must be remanded.\n\n    2. The Commission\u2019s Consideration of \u201cAny\u201d Such Costs\n       Under \u00a7 3633(b)\n\n      A second problem with the disputed Order is that, in\nfocusing its analysis on costs attributed to competitive products\nunder 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(a)(2), the Commission failed to\n\u201cconsider . . . the degree to which any costs are uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with any competitive products\u201d\nas required by 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633(b). As the plain meaning of\nthat provision suggests, the Accountability Act clearly requires\nthe Commission to consider any costs uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products at the\ntime it reviews its appropriate share determination under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3). This includes, but is not limited to, any costs\nfitting that description that the Commission may have already\nconsidered when it promulgated regulations under \u00a7 3633(a)(1)\nor \u00a7 3633(a)(2).\n\n     The record in this case indicates that the Commission did\nnot follow this statutory mandate. Instead, the Commission,\nrelying on its inadequately explained interpretation of the\nAccountability Act, focused narrowly on the costs it had\nconsidered \u2013 and attributed \u2013 in promulgating regulations under\n\f                               22\n\u00a7 3633(a)(2). At oral argument, counsel for the Commission\nsuggested that by piecing together the Commission\u2019s responses\nto various comments, we could find that the Commission did\nindeed consider a broader class of costs. Tr. of Oral Argument\nat 75; see also Br. for Respondent at 35-38. Even assuming that\nis right, however, the Commission\u2019s Order does not make it\nclear or comprehensible, and we cannot fill in the blanks in the\nCommission\u2019s reasoning. The simple point here is that the\nCommission erred in concluding that it had discharged its\nresponsibility to consider any costs uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products by\nvirtue of the fact that it had already considered these costs when\nsetting the price floor under \u00a7 3633(a)(2).\n\n     An agency Order that is at odds with the requirements of\nthe applicable statute cannot survive judicial review. See, e.g.,\nMichigan v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959748\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959748/michigan-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Cir. 2004)). On the record before us, the\nCommission\u2019s treatment of \u00a7 3633(b) cannot survive judicial\nreview. Therefore, we are constrained to remand the Order to\nthe Commission for further consideration.\n\n    On remand, the Commission must consider all costs\nuniquely or disproportionately associated with competitive\nproducts in setting the appropriate share, even if it has already\naccounted for those costs under \u00a7 3633(a)(1) and (a)(2).\n\f                              23\n     Furthermore, the Commission should fully address the\nissue left open in the court\u2019s 2018 decision in UPS v. PRC. The\ncourt in that decision recognized that, because the costs\nattributed test under \u00a7 3633(a)(2) is conservative, there may be\ninstitutional costs that are \u201cuniquely or disproportionately\nassociated with competitive products,\u201d even though they\ncannot be said to stand in \u201creliably identified causal\nrelationships\u201d with them. The Commission\u2019s Order in this case\ndoes not address this.\n\n     In addition, the Commission must explain the relevance (if\nany) of costs it may have considered in implementing\n\u00a7 3633(a)(1). At oral argument, counsel for the Commission\nsuggested that the Commission might not have to further\nconsider costs uniquely or disproportionately associated with\ncompetitive products under \u00a7 3633(b) because it had already\nconsidered them pursuant to \u00a7 3633(a)(1). Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 43-44, 48, 54-55. However, this possibility is\noffered as nothing more than a fleeting suggestion in the\nCommission\u2019s Order and its brief to the court. Compare Order\nat 144, J.A. 663, and Br. for Respondent at 19 (focusing only\non \u00a7 3633(a)(2)), with Order at 160 n.294, J.A. 679 n.294, and\nBr. for Respondent at 36 (mentioning the Commission\u2019s test\nunder \u00a7 3633(a)(1)). If this point is somehow critical to the\nCommission\u2019s analysis, the Commission must make that clear\nin the first instance. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n94-95 (1943).\n\n     We do not mean for these examples to exhaust the issues\nthat the Commission must address on remand, only to illustrate\nsome of what a fuller \u201cconsider[ation]\u201d of the relevant costs\nwill involve.\n\n                             ***\n\f                               24\n    In sum, the Commission must address the issues\nhighlighted above before we can say whether its formula-based\napproach to determining the appropriate share under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3) is permissible and reasonable. On remand, the\nCommission might decide to revise its judgment regarding the\n\u201cappropriate share\u201d under \u00a7 3633(a)(3). Indeed, at oral\nargument, counsel for the Commission conceded that the\n\u201cfloor\u201d established under \u00a7 3633(a)(3) might need to be\nadjusted if the Commission found any costs uniquely or\ndisproportionately associated with competitive products. Tr. of\nOral Argument at 49-50. It is also possible, however, that the\nCommission might decide against revising its bottom-line\njudgment, given the other factors the Commission must\nconsider under \u00a7 3633(b) and the latitude that the text affords\nthe Commission in making a final determination.\n\n     We take no position on this matter. It is not for this court\nto say that the Commission must account for costs in any\nspecific way under \u00a7 3633(b) or that the Commission must\nmake any particular \u201cappropriate share\u201d determination under\n\u00a7 3633(a)(3). Rather, the judgment of the court is that, on\nremand, the Commission must consider all the costs referenced\nunder \u00a7 3633(b), as the Accountability Act clearly commands.\nAnd any decision that the Commission reaches regarding the\nmeaning and application of \u00a7 3633(b) in connection with the\n\u201cappropriate share\u201d determination under \u00a7 3633(a)(3) must be\nconsistent with the terms of the statute, must be\ncomprehensible, and must otherwise satisfy the requirements\nof reasoned decision-making.\n\n                       III.

At his trial,\nan FBI forensic expert testified that hairs found on the victim\nwere microscopically identical to Butler\u2019s hair.           The\ngovernment recently acknowledged, though, that hair evidence\nof the kind introduced against Butler was false and exceeded\nthe limits of science, and that the prosecution knew or should\nhave known as much at the time of his trial.\n\n     Butler brought a motion to set aside his conviction and\nvacate his sentence based on the government\u2019s admission that\nit had used false evidence against him. We examine a single\nquestion: whether the false hair evidence presented by the\ngovernment was material. The district court found the\nevidence immaterial. In our view, however, there is a\nreasonable likelihood that the false hair evidence introduced\nagainst Butler could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. We thus\nreverse the judgment of the district court.\n\n                              I.\n\n                              A.\n\n     For decades, the FBI Laboratory employed a form of\nforensic analysis dubbed \u201chair microscopy.\u201d Hair microscopy\ncalled for forensic examiners to conduct side-by-side,\nmicroscopic comparisons of hair samples in an effort to\nascertain whether hairs from a crime scene matched hairs from\n\f                               3\na suspect. The government used ostensible matches at trial as\nscientific evidence linking defendants to crimes.\n\n     There was, however, a significant problem with that field\nof analysis: science had not validated its foundational\npremises. Existing studies failed to support a trained\nexaminer\u2019s ability to identify a \u201cmatch\u201d based on any objective\nsystem of visual hair comparison or to validly estimate the\nfrequency of hair characteristics (and therefore of matches) in\nthe general population.\n\n      Although those limitations were long known to the\ngovernment, prosecutors continued to rely on hair evidence at\ntrial. By 2009, however, multiple developments spurred the\ngovernment to reassess its position on the evidentiary\nreliability of hair microscopy. First, the National Academy of\nSciences published a groundbreaking report critical of the\npractice. The report confirmed that \u201c[n]o scientifically\naccepted statistics exist about the frequency with which\nparticular characteristics of hair are distributed in the\npopulation,\u201d and noted the absence of any uniform standards\nfor identifying how many characteristics must be shared\nbetween two hairs before they can be called a \u201cmatch.\u201d Nat\u2019l\nResearch Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the\nUnited States: A Path Forward 160 (2009). Additionally, DNA\ntesting exonerated several men who had been convicted using\nhair evidence, some of whom had been imprisoned for decades.\n\n    Those events prompted the federal government to\nundertake its largest postconviction review in history.\nWorking in tandem with defendants\u2019 rights groups, the\ngovernment audited thousands of convictions from the pre-\n2000 period to identify cases in which the government made\nuse of false hair evidence. This is one of the identified cases.\n\f                                4\n                               B.\n\n     On September 30, 1970, appellant Butler was arrested for\nthe murder of Jesse Mears. The previous day, police had\ndiscovered Mears\u2019s body in an apartment building Mears\nmanaged in Northeast Washington D.C. The victim was found\nin a vacant apartment\u2019s bathroom with toilet paper and a\nstocking stuffed in his mouth, both \u201csoggy\u201d wet with a clear\nliquid. Trial Tr. 36, July 8, 1971, S.A. 8. His hands were\nbound, a telephone cord was wrapped around his neck, and his\nkeys were missing. The police found a soda bottle near his\nbody filled with water, a paint pan in the kitchen sink, and a\nbelt split into two pieces in the kitchen. The cause of death was\ndetermined to be \u201casphyxiation secondary to garroting.\u201d Trial\nTr. 38, July 8, 1971, S.A. 10.\n\n     The prosecution\u2019s lead witnesses were James Hill and\nPhyllis Gail Robinson. On direct examination, Hill testified\nthat he had known Butler for several years, and had called\nButler at around 3:00 or 3:30PM on the day of the murder.\nWhen Butler came to the phone \u201che sounded like he was out of\nbreath.\u201d Trial Tr. 66, July 8, 1971, A.A. 181. Hill said that he\nasked where Butler had been, and Butler, according to Hill,\nvolunteered that \u201che had just killed the rent man\u201d\u2014i.e., Jesse\nMears. Id. at 67, A.A. 182. Butler said that the \u201crent man\u201d had\n\u201ccaught [Butler] selling narcotics to two boys,\u201d and that, in an\nensuing struggle, Butler attempted to strangle Mears with a belt\nbut used a telephone cord after the belt broke. Id. Hill testified\nthat Butler then said he had poured water down the victim\u2019s\nthroat \u201cto make sure that he was dead.\u201d Id.\n\n     Hill further testified that Butler came to Hill\u2019s house later\nthat day, around 4:00PM. Robinson, who was then dating Hill,\njoined them at the house sometime later. According to Hill\u2019s\ntestimony, Hill asked Butler whether Hill could share the story\n\f                                5\nwith Robinson. Butler agreed, and Hill told Robinson that\nButler had just killed a man. Butler then recounted some of the\ndetails of the crime to Robinson.\n\n     Hill related that, the following day, police officers came to\nhis house, asked if he knew anything about a pair of keys, and\nsearched under his mattress. Later, at the police station, Hill\ngave a statement to police officers describing the previous\nday\u2019s events. Hill testified that Robinson was also at the\nstation but was separated from Hill. He said that he did not\noverhear the officers say anything to Robinson and that he had\nnot been threatened by the officers.\n\n     Robinson\u2019s testimony about the day of the murder tracked\nHill\u2019s in material respects. She admitted that, initially, she had\ntold the police that her knowledge of the murder came from\nHill rather than Butler. But after a police officer informed her\nthat her statement was inconsistent with Hill\u2019s in that regard,\nshe revised the story and said that Butler had told her.\nRobinson testified that her original statement had been a lie\nfueled by fear because, in her words, she \u201chad never been in no\ntrouble.\u201d Trial Tr. 263, July 9, 1971, S.A. 176.\n\n     To rebut the government\u2019s evidence, the defense attacked\nthe couple\u2019s credibility. Both witnesses prevaricated about\ntheir drug use in their trial testimony. Hill originally denied\nhaving a specific reason for calling Butler the day of the murder\nand claimed that the two of them had discussed nothing other\nthan the murder. But later, Hill admitted he had called Butler\nto obtain narcotics and had used heroin with Butler before\nRobinson arrived.\n\n     Hill was also unable to deliver a consistent narrative about\nhis drug use after the murder. At one point, he testified that he\nhad stopped using heroin seven or eight months before the trial.\nBut at another point, he claimed he had stopped using narcotics\n\f                                6\nabout one year before the trial. When the defense noted that a\none-year period would have been before the September\nmurder\u2014and thus before a day on which Hill had already\nadmitted to using heroin\u2014he nonetheless insisted that it had\nbeen \u201cabout a year,\u201d before ultimately conceding it could have\nbeen \u201cless than a year.\u201d Trial Tr. 112\u2013113, July 8, 1971, A.A.\n227\u2013228.\n\n     Additionally, Hill testified that Robinson had snorted\nheroin the day of the murder while the three were together at\nthe house. But he also stated that Robinson only used heroin\non weekends. When the defense noted that the day of the\nmurder was a Tuesday, he revised his earlier testimony and said\nthat he did not remember whether she had snorted heroin that\nday. Hill also admitted that he may have given inconsistent\nstatements to defense lawyers about what he had overheard at\nthe police station and whether officers had threatened him with\ncriminal liability.\n\n     For her part, Robinson, like Hill, gave contradictory\ntestimony about her drug use. At first, she testified that she\nonly took heroin on weekends. But she was forced to renege\nand acknowledge she had taken heroin on the Tuesday of the\nmurder. And like Hill, Robinson had given inconsistent\nstatements on a question in dispute at trial: who (Hill or Butler)\nhad told her about the murder.\n\n     The government responded by introducing an array of\ncorroborating evidence. Several witnesses testified to having\nseen Butler on the day of the crime near the apartment building.\nA witness testified to seeing Butler and the victim working\nside-by-side on a car together around 1:00PM in front of the\nbuilding. An acquaintance of Butler\u2019s testified that he had seen\nButler walking toward the area of the building between 2:00\nand 3:00PM. And several witnesses testified that they found\n\f                               7\nthe victim\u2019s stolen key ring after it was thrown from the roof of\na building near Butler\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\n     Of the sixteen fingerprint impressions recovered from the\ncrime scene, none belonged to Butler. But the government\npresented two other kinds of forensic evidence at trial. First, a\ngovernment expert testified that paint found on the victim\u2019s\nclothing, on the soda bottle at the crime scene, and on the\ndefendant\u2019s pants, all could have come from the same source\nbased on their type, texture, and color, and were likely wet\nwhen applied.\n\n     Second, and of particular relevance, the forensic expert\ntestified in detail about hair samples found on the victim\u2019s\nclothing, including his jacket, shirt, and pants. The expert\ndescribed a \u201cdirect microscopic comparison test\u201d he had\nconducted, comparing the hairs from the victim\u2019s clothing to\nsample hairs from Butler. Trial Tr. 527, July 13, 1971, S.A.\n349. The expert explained he had considered sixteen features\nof the hair, describing some of the features as \u201cvery important\u201d\nor \u201cvery distinct\u201d identifying characteristics. Id. at 529, S.A.\n351. The two sets of hairs, according to the expert, \u201cmatch[ed]\nin all microscopic characteristics,\u201d and were thus\n\u201cmicroscopically the same or alike.\u201d Id. at 528\u201330, S.A. 350\u2013\n52. Later, the prosecutor asked whether the expert was saying\nthat the hairs from the victim\u2019s clothing were \u201conly similar\u201d to\nButler\u2019s. Id. at 535, S.A. 357. The expert responded, \u201cNo, I\nam not. When you imply that something is similar, you are\nimplying that it is also different in some respects. My report\nand my testimony is that these hairs are the same. They are\nalike in all identifiable microscopic characteristics.\u201d Id.\n\n    The expert gave somewhat varying testimony about the\nsignificance of that finding. At one point, he noted that \u201chairs\ndo not contain enough identifying characteristics to be\n\f                               8\npositively identified as originating from a certain head of a\ncertain individual to the exclusion of all other individuals in\nthis race group.\u201d Id. at 530, S.A. 352. But he then stated that\nthe hairs he had examined \u201care the same or alike in all the\nmicroscopic characteristics that were available to [him].\u201d Id.\nAnd when asked, \u201chow likely or unlikely is it for two hairs to\nbe microscopically alike, yet come from different people?,\u201d\ninstead of answering that he did not know (the scientifically\nsound answer), the expert said that, in the approximately\n10,000 examinations he had conducted, \u201cthere have been four\nor five times when the hair of the suspect and the hair of the\nvictim was so nearly alike . . . that I was unable to come to a\nconclusion as to where these hairs originated. It would be very\nseldom.\u201d Id. at 531, S.A. 353.\n\n     On redirect, the expert reiterated that testimony. He was\nasked, \u201c[i]s it your testimony that in 10,000 examinations only\nfour or five times the victims and the defendants have been . . .\nso alike you were unable to distinguish?\u201d Id. at 535, S.A. 357.\nHe answered in the affirmative: \u201cApproximately 10,000.\u201d Id.\nBut on re-cross, when defense counsel asked, \u201cwe don\u2019t know\nhow many other people have the same microscopic\ncharacteristics of their hair follicles as the one that you\nidentified as Mr. Butler\u2019s hair from the clothing of Mr.\nMears?,\u201d he answered, \u201cYes, that is correct. I have no idea\nwhether anyone would have the same microscopic\ncharacteristics.\u201d Id. at 536, S.A. 358.\n\n    In summation, the prosecutor said the following to the jury\nabout the significance of the expert\u2019s hair testimony:\n\n       He said when he compared the hairs that were\n       found on the victim\u2019s clothing with the\n       defendant\u2019s hairs that were taken by [the\n       detective] from him at the infirmary, when he\n\f                              9\n       compared those two, what were they? They\n       were the same in every microscopic detail, the\n       same.\n\n        I said, how often . . . does it happen? You\n       can\u2019t be positive, yes, but how often does it\n       happen that two people\u2019s hair, two different\n       people, are so similar and so alike that you\n       would be unable to tell? Out of 10,000\n       examinations, he said he recalls it happening\n       approximately four times.\n\nId. at 731\u201332, S.A. 495\u201396.\n\n     Later, in his rebuttal summation, the prosecutor reminded\nthe jury:\n\n       You have the FBI report saying that this man\u2019s\n       hair compared with the hairs found on the body\n       of the dead man. They are the same in every\n       microscopic characteristic\u2014every one. You\n       heard the sixteen possible combinations, lack\n       thereof, etc. Every one matched.\n\nId. at 783, S.A. 535.\n\n     On July 15, 1971, the jury convicted Butler of felony\nmurder, first degree murder, and robbery. Butler appealed his\nconviction to this court, arguing, among other things, that the\ntrial judge had erred in declining to order physical and\npsychiatric examinations of Hill and Robinson. See United\nStates v. Butler, 481 F.2d 531, 532 (D.C. Cir. 1973). We\nrejected Butler\u2019s arguments and affirmed his conviction. See\nid. at 537.\n\f                               10\n                               C.\n\n     In 2015, more than four decades after Butler\u2019s convictions,\nthe government reviewed his case as part of the overall\nexamination of cases involving the use of discredited hair\nmicroscopy analysis. The government \u201cdetermined that the\nmicroscopic hair comparison analysis testimony or laboratory\nreport presented in this case included statements that exceeded\nthe limits of science . . . and were, therefore, invalid.\u201d Letter\nfrom Norman Wong, Special Counsel for the Department of\nJustice to Vincent H. Cohen Jr., Acting United States Attorney\nfor the District of Columbia 2 (Sept. 11, 2015) (Wong Letter),\nA.A. 68.\n\n     The government identified two types of errors in the\nexpert\u2019s testimony against Butler. First, \u201c[t]he examiner stated\nor implied that the evidentiary hair could be associated with a\nspecific individual to the exclusion of all others.\u201d Id. at 71.\nSecond, \u201c[t]he examiner assigned to the positive association a\nstatistical weight or probability or provided a likelihood that\nthe questioned hair originated from a particular source, or an\nopinion as to the likelihood or rareness of the positive\nassociation that could lead the jury to believe that valid\nstatistical weight can be assigned to a microscopic hair\nassociation.\u201d Id. Both statements were flawed in that they\n\u201cexceed[ed] the limits of science.\u201d Id.\n\n     The government advised that, if Butler were to seek post-\nconviction relief \u201cbased on the Department[] [of Justice\u2019s]\ndisclosure that microscopic hair comparison laboratory reports\nor testimony used in this case contained statements that\nexceeded the limits of science,\u201d the government then would\nwaive any reliance on the statute of limitations or any\nprocedural-default defense \u201cin order to permit the resolution of\nlegal claims arising from the erroneous presentation of\n\f                              11\nmicroscopic hair examination laboratory reports or testimony.\u201d\nId. at 68. The government, though, took \u201cno position regarding\nthe materiality of the error in this case.\u201d Id.\n\n     In September 2016, Butler moved to vacate his sentence\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that the false hair\ntestimony violated his rights under the Due Process Clause.\nThe district court denied the motion, holding that the hair\nevidence was not material and that its use at trial thus did not\nviolate the Constitution. United States v. Butler, 278 F. Supp.\n3d 461 (D.D.C. 2017). Butler now appeals.\n\n                              II.\n\n     The scope of our review is confined. The government\nconcedes that the hair microscopy evidence presented against\nButler was false and exceeded the limits of science. The\ngovernment also acknowledges that the prosecution knew or\nshould have known of hair microscopy evidence\u2019s\ninadequacies at the time of trial. And the government waives\nstatute-of-limitations and procedural-default defenses. In light\nof the government\u2019s concessions and waivers, the sole question\nfor us is whether the prosecution\u2019s use of the false hair\ntestimony against Butler was material. If so, his constitutional\nrights were infringed.\n\n     In a line of cases beginning with Napue v. Illinois, 360\nU.S. 264 (1959), the Supreme Court has consistently\nrecognized that the government\u2019s knowing presentation of\nfalse evidence against a criminal defendant is \u201cincompatible\nwith \u2018rudimentary demands of justice.\u2019\u201d Giglio v. United\nStates, 405 U.S. 150, 153 (1972) (quoting Mooney v. Holohan,\n294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935)). Yet not every knowing use of false\nevidence by the government against a defendant necessarily\nrises to the level of constitutional error. Rather, the\nintroduction of false evidence unconstitutionally denies a\n\f                               12\ndefendant a fair trial if the evidence counts as material. E.g.,\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 104\u2013108 (1976).\n\n     As we recently explained, \u201cthe government\u2019s introduction\nof false testimony is material if the evidence \u2018could in any\nreasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u2019\u201d\nUnited States v. Ausby, 916 F.3d 1089, 1092 (D.C. Cir. 2019)\n(per curiam) (quoting Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154) (ellipses\nomitted); see Napue, 360 U.S. at 271. That \u201c\u2018reasonable\nlikelihood\u2019 standard does not require the defendant to show\n\u2018that he more likely than not would have been acquitted\u2019 absent\nthe false statements. Rather, the defendant need show only that\nthe false testimony \u2018undermines confidence\u2019 in the verdict.\nThus, even if the false testimony \u2018may not have affected the\njury\u2019s verdict,\u2019 it is material if the evidence reasonably could\nhave affected the verdict.\u201d Ausby, 916 F.3d. at 1093 (quoting\nWearry v. Cain, 136 S. Ct. 1002, 1006 & n.6 (2016) (per\ncuriam)) (formatting modified).\n\n     So understood, the \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d test \u201cis quite\neasily satisfied.\u201d Id. at 1093 (quoting United States v.\nWilliams, 233 F.3d 592, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2000)). The standard\nis \u201cstrict\u201d against the government, \u201cnot just because [the cases]\ninvolve prosecutorial misconduct, but more importantly\nbecause they involve a corruption of the truth-seeking function\nof the trial process.\u201d Agurs, 427 U.S. at 104. Indeed, we have\ndescribed the reasonable-likelihood standard as establishing \u201ca\nveritable hair trigger for setting aside the conviction,\u201d United\nStates v. Gale, 314 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2003), and as\n\u201cmandat[ing] a virtual automatic reversal of a criminal\nconviction,\u201d Williams, 233 F.3d at 594 (quoting United States\nv. Stofsky, 527 F.2d 237, 243 (2d Cir. 1975)).\n\n     In Ausby, we recently applied the reasonable-likelihood\ntest in closely parallel circumstances. There, as here, the\n\f                                13\ngovernment had introduced false hair microscopy evidence\nagainst the defendant at trial. And there, as here, the sole issue\nwe confronted was whether the evidence was material. The\ndistrict court, as in this case, had concluded that the evidence\nwas immaterial, but we reversed. Explaining that the \u201cfalse\nhair-comparison testimony\u201d presented against Ausby \u201cwas\nneither the sole piece of evidence on which the prosecution\nhung its case nor redundant or irrelevant,\u201d we determined that\nthe \u201ctestimony falls on the material side of the spectrum.\u201d\nAusby, 916 F.3d at 1094\u201395. We reach the same conclusion\nhere, applying the same \u201cquite easily satisfied\u201d materiality\nstandard. Id. at 1093.\n\n     The cornerstone of the government\u2019s case against Butler\nwas the testimony of Hill and (to a lesser degree) Robinson.\nHill, though, repeatedly offered false testimony about his drug\nuse, falsities that were revealed or corrected upon further\nexamination.       And the defense introduced credible\nimpeachment evidence demonstrating Hill\u2019s prior inconsistent\nstatement about the circumstances of his police statement.\nRobinson was also an admitted drug user and similarly testified\nfalsely about her heroin use on the day of the murder. And she\nadmitted to making a prior inconsistent statement on the source\nof her knowledge of the crime. In the absence of corroborating\nevidence, then, a reasonable juror could have doubted their\ncredibility and thus discounted their testimony.\n\n     We in fact said as much forty-seven years ago when we\ninitially reviewed Butler\u2019s conviction. In addressing (and\nultimately rejecting) a claim that the trial court should have\nordered examinations of Hill and Robinson for purposes of\nassisting the jury in weighing their credibility, we said that their\ntestimony \u201cpresent[ed] a particular danger of unreliability.\u201d\nButler, 481 F.2d at 534. We explained that their testimony\nabout their drug use \u201cshould have sufficed to put the jury on\n\f                                14\nnotice that, to the extent the witnesses\u2019 testimony was\nuncorroborated, it should be weighed with caution.\u201d Id. at 535.\nAnd \u201c[t]he danger of unreliability,\u201d we observed, \u201cis\nsubstantially increased by a factor present in this case . . .\n: \u2018The addict-turned-informer (or prosecution witness) may\nhave a special and very powerful motive to fabricate a case for\nhis own benefit,\u2019\u201d i.e., the threat of criminal prosecution. Id. at\n534 (quoting United States v. Kinnard, 465 F.2d 566, 574 (D.C.\nCir. 1972)) (formatting modified).              Defense counsel\naccordingly \u201curged the jury to conclude that Hill and Robinson\n\u2018lied . . . on the stand.\u2019\u201d Butler, 278 F. Supp. 3d at 473 (quoting\ntrial transcript).\n\n     Notwithstanding our significant concerns about Hill\u2019s and\nRobinson\u2019s reliability, we held that the trial court\u2019s failure to\norder their examinations fell short of an abuse of discretion,\nchiefly because \u201cof the substantial corroborative evidence\nintroduced by the government.\u201d Butler, 481 F.2d at 535. The\nprosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury echoed our\nestimation of the corroborating evidence\u2019s centrality. He\nstressed to the jury that \u201c[w]e don\u2019t ask you to only believe\nJames Hill. We only ask you to do what is reasonable, to test\nhis story and to test Gail Robinson\u2019s story . . . . Test those with\nthe other evidence and what have you? You start to realize that\nthose stories are true. It rings true. Each little bit of evidence\nstarts to add up.\u201d Trial Tr. 779, July 14, 1971, S.A. 531.\n\n     Addressing what he evidently sensed to be a core\nvulnerability in the government\u2019s case\u2014Hill\u2019s drug use and the\nconcomitant \u201cdanger of [his] unreliability\u201d as a witness, 481\nF.2d at 534\u2014the prosecutor said to the jury: \u201cthe fact that\nJames Hill was a narcotic addict at the time . . . does that mean\nthat in and of itself he didn\u2019t hear what the defendant told him?\nEverything that he has said has been corroborated by\ncircumstantial evidence and scientific evidence. Ladies and\n\f                               15\ngentlemen, test the testimony once again . . . . What does it\nshow? Corroboration, corroboration, corroboration.\u201d Trial Tr.\n781, July 14, 1971, S.A. 533.\n\n      Among the corroborating evidence that the prosecution\nand our court deemed critical, the false hair testimony was\nespecially weighty. Apart from Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s\ntestimony, the government\u2019s principal corroborating evidence\npointing to Butler\u2019s culpability consisted of: (i) forensic\nevidence indicating that paint chips found on Butler, the victim,\nand at the crime scene could have come from the same source;\n(ii) testimony from eyewitnesses who saw Butler in the vicinity\nof the crime scene near the estimated time of the crime; (iii) the\ndiscovery of the victim\u2019s keys in an area Butler frequented; and\n(iv) the false testimony that Butler\u2019s hair microscopically\nmatched hair found on the victim. See Butler, 481 F.2d at 533.\n\n     With regard to the first of those categories of corroborating\nevidence, an expert\u2019s forensic paint analysis suggested that\npaint chips found on Butler, on the victim, and on objects found\nat the crime scene could have all originated from the same\nsource. Yet the government\u2019s own witnesses also testified that\nthe paint was likely wet when applied to the clothing and that\nButler had been in the apartment days before at the time the\napartment was painted. Jurors therefore could have concluded\nthat the spot of paint had been applied to Butler\u2019s clothing days\nbefore the murder\u2014indeed, that may have been the most\nplausible explanation based on the government\u2019s evidence.\n\n     The government also offered evidence suggesting that\nButler had been seen going to and from the area of the murder\nat times roughly corresponding with the estimated time of the\ncrime. The evidence at trial, however, suggested that Butler\nfrequented the neighborhood. For example, the government\u2019s\nwitnesses testified that he had been inside the apartment where\n\f                                16\nthe murder took place days earlier and had also helped the\nvictim fix a car just outside the apartment on the day of the\ncrime. In light of Butler\u2019s regular, licit visits to the area, a\nreasonable juror could have construed his presence there in the\nrough timeframe of the offense, standing alone, to offer modest\ncorroboration for Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s testimony.\n\n     As for the victim\u2019s keys, a set of keys carried by the victim\nwas found on the rooftop of a house located on a block where\nButler\u2019s girlfriend lived and Butler often stayed. But no one\ntestified to having seen Butler with the keys, there was\ntestimony that some of the keys were already missing by the\ntime of the murder, the keys were found on the rooftop almost\ntwo weeks after Butler had been arrested for the murder, and\nthe rooftop, while on the same block as Butler\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s\nresidence, was also within two blocks of the murder scene. As\na result, while the keys could have been deposited on the\nrooftop by Butler, they also could have been put there by\nsomeone else who committed the crime. After all, it was not a\nsecret that the police had been searching for the keys: Hill at\nleast knew of the police\u2019s interest in finding the keys based on\nhis testimony that the officers had searched his residence for\nthem.\n\n     By comparison, the hair microscopy evidence offered\npowerful corroboration for Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s testimony\npointing to Butler as the perpetrator. The defense\u2019s sole\nexplanation for the presence of hair matching Butler\u2019s on the\nvictim\u2019s clothing, apart from noting questions about the\nprobability of a hair match in the first place, was to suggest that\nButler\u2019s hair had been transferred to the victim when the two\nof them worked on a car together earlier in the day of the\nmurder. But the government had a compelling response:\n\u201cDoes common sense tell you that when two men are just\nstanding next to one another the hair will get on the coat, the\n\f                                17\nshirt and on the pants?\u201d the prosecutor asked in summation.\n\u201cCommon sense will tell you,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat hair from a\nperson gets on another person\u2019s clothing if the person were\nstanding over him or sitting on him strangling him. What is\nmore reasonable?\u201d Trial Tr. 777\u201378, July 14, 1971, S.A. 529\u2013\n30.\n\n     The government now seeks to cast doubt on the force of\nthe hair microscopy evidence presented at trial.                The\ngovernment notes the expert\u2019s testimony at one point that \u201chair\nanalysis does not permit a positive identification of a hair as\n\u2018originating from a certain head.\u2019\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 50\u201351 (quoting\nTrial Tr. 530\u201332, July 13, 1971, S.A. 352\u2013354). But the\ngovernment itself, after reviewing the trial transcript,\ndetermined that the \u201cexaminer stated or implied that the\nevidentiary hair could be associated with a specific individual\nto the exclusion of all others,\u201d a \u201ctype of testimony\u201d that is false\nand \u201cexceeds the limits of the science.\u201d Wong Letter 5, A.A.\n71 (emphasis added). The government cannot in one breath\nconcede the hair testimony\u2019s falsity and in the next breath urge\nthat the hair testimony was accurate after all.\n\n     At any rate, in Ausby, the expert\u2019s testimony similarly\nincluded a statement that \u201cmicroscopic hair comparisons do not\nconstitute a basis of positive personal identification\u201d; and he\nthus allowed that the hairs not only could have \u201coriginated from\nthe head of Mr. Ausby\u201d but also could have come \u201cfrom some\nother person whose head hairs or pubic hairs are\nmicroscopically identical.\u201d 916 F.3d at 1091 (formatting\nmodified). We then acknowledged that the expert \u201chad\nconceded that microscopic hair comparison analysis cannot\nproduce a positive identification.\u201d Id. But we still determined\nthat the admittedly false hair testimony presented against\nAusby, taken as a whole, was material. So too here.\n\f                               18\n     Even if the expert\u2019s testimony against Butler did at times\ninclude an acknowledgement that hair microscopy could not\nproduce a positive identification, at other points, the expert or\nprosecutor indicated that it could. That is presumably why the\ngovernment has now determined that the expert falsely \u201cstated\nor implied that the evidentiary hair could be associated with a\nspecific individual to the exclusion of all others.\u201d Wong Letter\n5, A.A. 71; see also id. at 7, A.A. 73. The expert recounted the\nsixteen characteristics of the hair he had analyzed. Describing\ntwo of those characteristics in more detail, the expert referred\nto them as a \u201cvery important identifying feature\u201d and an\n\u201cimportant identifying characteristic.\u201d Trial Tr. 529\u201330, July\n13, 1971, S.A. 351\u201352 (emphasis added). And when the\nprosecutor asked whether the expert was \u201csaying that the hairs\nthat were found of the defendant\u2019s on the clothes of the victim\nare only similar,\u201d the expert doubled down: \u201cNo, I am not.\nWhen you imply that something is similar, you are implying\nthat it is also different in some respects. My report and my\ntestimony is that these hairs are the same.\u201d Id. at 535, S.A. 357.\n\n     Notably, the framing of the prosecutor\u2019s question itself\nassumed that the hairs found \u201con the clothes of the victims\u201d\nwere \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\u201d hairs, and the expert\u2019s answer\nreinforced to the jury that the \u201chairs are the same.\u201d Indeed,\neven defense counsel bought into that assumption about the\nexpert\u2019s testimony when he asked the expert a question\nconcerning the \u201chair from the clothing of\u201d the victim that the\nexpert had \u201cidentified as Mr. Butler\u2019s.\u201d Id. at 536, S.A. 358.\n\n    The government points to a response that the expert\nelsewhere gave when asked, \u201chow likely or unlikely is it for\ntwo hairs to be microscopically alike, yet come from different\npeople?\u201d Id. at 531, S.A. 353. The expert answered, \u201c[i]t\nwould be very seldom\u201d; but as a preface to that conclusion, he\nsomewhat confusingly referenced the number of times he had\n\f                                19\nbeen unable to differentiate a victim\u2019s hair from the defendant\u2019s\n(four or five times out of roughly 10,000 examinations). Id.\nEven if the expert\u2019s reference to a victim\u2019s hair might have\nseemed off-base, a confused juror might well have focused on\nhis ultimate response of \u201cvery seldom.\u201d Id. That may be why\nthe government pointed to this exact exchange as one in which\nthe expert had invalidly \u201cassigned to the positive\nassociation\u201d\u2014i.e., the association of the hair \u201cwith a specific\nindividual\u201d\u2014\u201ca statistical weight or probability or provided a\nlikelihood that the questioned hair originated from a particular\nsource, or an opinion as to the likelihood or rareness of the\npositive association that could lead the jury to believe that valid\nstatistical weight can be assigned to a microscopic hair\nassociation.\u201d Wong Letter 5, A.A. 71.\n\n     In his closing argument to the jury, moreover, the\nprosecutor used the figures referenced by the expert, but in a\nmanner indicating that they directly responded to the question\nthat had been posed to the expert:\n\n    Agent Scholberg of the FBI . . . when he compared\n    the hairs that were found on the victim\u2019s clothing\n    with the defendant\u2019s hairs . . . [t]hey were the same\n    in every microscopic detail, the same. I said, How\n    often, Agent Scholberg, does it happen? You can\u2019t\n    be positive, yes, but how often does it happen that\n    two people\u2019s hair, two different people, are so\n    similar and so alike that you would be unable to\n    tell? Out of 10,000 examinations, he said he recalls\n    it happening approximately four times.\n\nTrial Tr. 731\u201332, July 14, 1971, S.A. 495\u201396 (emphasis\nadded). A juror hearing that argument by the prosecutor could\nhave readily inferred that, according to the expert, it would be\nexceedingly unlikely for two hairs deemed to be\n\f                              20\nmicroscopically identical to have come from different people.\nThat is precisely the kind of conclusion that science did not\n(and does not) support. In Ausby, we relied on the prosecutor\u2019s\nclosing argument as supporting our conclusion that the\npresentation of false hair evidence in that case was material.\n916 F.3d at 1095. We do likewise here.\n\n      The government finally contends that Hill\u2019s and\nRobinson\u2019s accurate recounting of various details found at the\ncrime scene\u2014such as the presence of a torn belt, a sock in the\nvictim\u2019s mouth, and a bottle with water\u2014lends corroboration\nto their accounts that Butler had committed the crime and told\nthem about it. That may be so, but the defense also presented\nevidence suggesting: (i) the police initially suspected that it\nwas Hill himself who possessed the victim\u2019s keys (and Hill\nknew as much); (ii) Hill had spoken with individuals who\nrelayed what someone who visited the crime scene had seen;\n(iii) Hill was not credible on the issue of whether he had been\nthreatened with criminal liability; and (iv) Robinson was not\ncredible on the source of her knowledge of the crime. The\ndefense argued to the jury that other witnesses who had seen\n(or been told about) the crime scene could have related details\nabout the scene to Hill and Robinson before they spoke with\nthe police. See Butler, 278 F. Supp. 3d at 467\u201368, 471, 473.\nThe defense also suggested to the jury that the police\nthemselves may have told Hill and Robinson about those\ndetails. Id. at 483 n.12.\n\n     Even if the last suggestion lacked \u201cconcrete support,\u201d id.,\na reasonable juror could have surmised that Hill and Robinson\nhad a motive to misstate the source of their information. And\nthe government, not Butler, bore the burden to demonstrate\nbeyond a reasonable doubt who had informed Hill and\nRobinson about the details of the crime scene. In the absence\nof the potentially confirming role played by the false hair\n\f                                21\nevidence, a reasonable juror could have found that the\ngovernment fell short of meeting its heavy burden on that\nscore, even without the defense advancing a compelling\nalternative theory.\n\n     Our dissenting colleague, though, would conclude that the\nfalse hair microscopy evidence introduced against Butler could\nnot have affected the jury, even under the \u201cquite easily\nsatisfied\u201d standard of materiality that governs when the\nprosecution presents false testimony. Ausby, 916 F.3d at 1093\n(quoting Williams, 233 F.3d at 594). As our colleague sees it,\nour conclusion in applying that standard here is out of step with\nother decisions. To the contrary, our conclusion is fully in step\nwith precedent, as best illustrated by our most germane and\nrecent decision, Ausby. There, we reached the same result,\nunder the same standard, in the same circumstances (also a\nmurder trial in which the prosecution had introduced false hair\nmicroscopy testimony). Our colleague emphasizes what he\nviews to be (i) the relatively insignificant role played by the\nfalse hair evidence in this case, and (ii) the strength of the other\nevidence implicating Butler. In both of those respects,\nhowever, this case is of a piece with Ausby.\n\n     First, in arguing that the false hair testimony played only a\nminor role in Butler\u2019s trial, our colleague submits that: the\ntestimony designated as false comprised only \u201ctwelve lines of\ntext during a four-day prosecution\u201d; a number of other lines of\ntestimony were deemed to qualify as curative, \u201climiting\nlanguage,\u201d including testimony specifically stating that the hair\nevidence was \u201cnot a positive identification\u201d; the prosecutor\nmade only limited reference to the hair evidence in his closing\narguments; and defense counsel explained the limitations of\nhair-microscopy evidence in his own closing argument.\nDissenting Op. 11, 16\u201321.\n\f                                22\n     All of that, however, was also true in Ausby, yet we\n(unanimously) found the false hair evidence to be material and\nthus vacated Ausby\u2019s conviction. In particular, in Ausby: the\ntestimony designated as false comprised virtually the same\nnumber of lines of transcript text (fifteen) in a four-day trial,\nAusby App. 74; a number of other lines of testimony were\ndeemed to qualify as curative, \u201climiting language,\u201d id.,\nincluding testimony specifically stating that hair microscopy\nevidence does \u201cnot constitute a basis of positive personal\nidentification,\u201d Ausby, 916 F.3d at 1091; the \u201cprosecution only\nbriefly discussed the hair evidence in its opening and closing\narguments,\u201d United States v. Ausby, 275 F. Supp. 3d 7, 30\n(D.D.C. 2017); and defense counsel explained and emphasized\nthe limitations of that evidence in his closing argument, id. at\n21; see Ausby, 916 F.3d at 1091. In that light, the allegedly\nlimited role played by the false hair testimony in this case\naffords no ground for reaching a different result than in Ausby.\n\n     Nor does the strength of the other evidence of guilt. Our\ndissenting colleague observes in that regard that: the\nprosecution in Butler\u2019s trial presented the testimony of twenty-\nthree witnesses over four days; the jury returned its verdict of\nguilt in one day; the district court, in finding the false hair\nevidence immaterial, \u201cpainstakingly reviewed\u201d the evidence\nand arguments presented the jury for some twelve pages of its\npublished opinion; and that court viewed the non-hair evidence\nof guilt to be \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Dissenting Op. 1\u20133, 5\u20136.\n\n     Again, though, all of that could equally be said about\nAusby. There, too, the prosecution presented the testimony of\ntwenty-three witnesses over four days, Ausby, 275 F. Supp. 3d\nat 10; the jury returned its verdict in just an hour and a half, id.\nat 22; the district court reviewed the evidence and arguments\npresented to the jury for some thirteen pages of its published\nopinion, id. at 9\u201323; and that court (coincidentally, the same\n\f                               23\njudge who wrote the equally thorough and considered decision\nwe review here) viewed the non-hair evidence to be\n\u201coverwhelming,\u201d id. at 32. Our court still found a reasonable\nlikelihood that the false hair evidence could have affected the\njury\u2019s judgment. And we follow that same course here.\n\n     In arguing that the hair evidence could not have affected\nthe jury\u2019s verdict, our colleague emphasizes the testimony of\nHill and Robinson. As explained, though, a reasonable juror\ncould have doubted their veracity, such that the hair evidence\ncould have played a confirming role. See pp. 13\u201314, 20\u201321,\nsupra. At any rate, in Ausby, too, the centerpiece of the\nprosecution\u2019s case was non-hair evidence connecting Ausby to\nthe crime. See Ausby, 275 F. Supp. 3d at 20, 31\u201332.\n\n     Of particular note, Ausby was known to carry highly\ndistinctive bottles of perfumed oils, and one such bottle was\nfound on the floor of the victim\u2019s bedroom next to her body\nand three bottles were found on the ground immediately\noutside, just below an open bedroom window. Id. at 11\u201313.\nThe defense thus did not dispute that Ausby, although a\nstranger to the victim, had been inside her apartment, or that he\nhad exited it through the window. Nor did Ausby dispute the\nprosecutor\u2019s account that the perpetrator had escaped through\nthe window after the victim\u2019s boyfriend knocked on her door.\nId. at 11. Nor, finally, did Ausby dispute that the victim had\nbeen away from her apartment for two weeks and returned only\non the day of her murder. Id. Ausby\u2019s defense was that, even\nif he had been in the bedroom and had exited it through the\nwindow, and even if the perpetrator had also fled through the\nwindow, Ausby and the perpetrator still could be different\npeople, with Ausby having been in the apartment in a several-\nday period before the day of the crime (and having also exited\nthrough the window even though the victim would not have\n\f                                24\nbeen home then, leaving his perfume vials behind). See id. at\n21.\n\n     The prosecutor, after reviewing the evidence about the\nperfume vials in his closing argument, said to the jury that he\ncould rest his case \u201cright there\u201d and could be \u201cboring\u201d the jury\n\u201cwith anything further.\u201d Id. at 20 (quoting trial transcript). But\neven if that evidence may have strongly connected Ausby to\nthe crime in the eyes of the jury, see id. at 31, the hair evidence\npurportedly putting Ausby\u2019s hair on the victim\u2019s body, see id.\nat 15, could have removed any conceivable question about\nwhether he was at the scene on the relevant day, rather than a\nprevious day. For that reason, we found a reasonable\nlikelihood that the false hair testimony could have affected the\njury\u2019s judgment. See Ausby, 916 F.3d at 1095.\n\n     Guided by our decision there, we reach the same\nconclusion here. In Ausby, the prosecution chiefly relied on\nphysical evidence connecting Ausby to the murder; and here,\nthe prosecution chiefly relied on Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s\ntestimony connecting Butler to the murder. In both cases, the\njury might well have convicted the defendants based on that\nevidence, regardless of the false hair microscopy testimony\nintroduced against them. But Butler need not show that the\njury could not (or would not) have convicted him without the\nfalse hair evidence. Recall that a defendant against whom the\nprosecution introduces false testimony need not show that the\njury more likely than not would have acquitted him without that\nevidence. See id. at 1092\u201393. Rather, \u201ceven if the false\ntestimony may not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, it is material\nif the evidence reasonably could have affected the verdict.\u201d Id.\nat 1093 (internal quotation marks omitted). Hence our\nconsistent description of the standard as \u201cquite easily\nsatisfied.\u201d Id. (quoting Williams, 233 F.3d at 594).\n\f                              25\n    We found it satisfied in Ausby, and we do likewise here.\nAnd we thus conclude that the government\u2019s presentation\nagainst Butler of evidence that it knew (or should have known)\nwas false denied him a fair trial.\n\n                     *    *   *    *   *\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the\ndistrict court and remand with instructions to grant Butler\u2019s\nmotion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\n\n                                                  So ordered.\n\f     KATSAS, Circuit Judge, dissenting: My colleagues set\naside a half-century-old murder conviction based on a few\nscraps of misleading testimony that were briefly given and\nimmediately corrected. In so doing, they recast Napue v.\nIllinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959), which permits relief only if there\nis a reasonable likelihood that false testimony caused a\nconviction, into a hairline trigger for setting aside convictions.\nAnd they downplay untainted evidence that overwhelmingly\nestablishes the defendant\u2019s guilt. For both reasons, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n    On September 29, 1970, Jesse Mears was strangled to\ndeath at age 75. Mears\u2019s body was found in the bathroom of a\nvacant third-floor apartment in a building that he managed. His\nhands were tied behind his back, and a telephone cord was\nwrapped tightly around his neck. He had been gagged with a\nstocking and a wad of toilet paper shoved into his mouth.\nDennis Butler, then 19 years old, was arrested the next day and\ncharged with first-degree murder, felony murder, and robbery.\n\n     Every court to review the evidence against Butler has\ndescribed it as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d United States v. Butler, 481\nF.2d 531, 535 (D.C. Cir. 1973); United States v. Butler, 278 F.\nSupp. 3d 461, 483 (D.D.C. 2017). Eyewitnesses placed Butler\nwith Mears around the time of the murder. Matching paint\nstains were found on their respective clothing. Mears\u2019s keys\nwere recovered near Butler\u2019s home. And, most damningly,\nButler confessed to the murder to two friends, James Hill and\nPhyllis Robinson, whose testimony recounting the confessions\nwas \u201ccomprehensive and believable and, more importantly,\nsupported by overwhelming extrinsic corroboration.\u201d Butler,\n278 F. Supp. 3d at 474 (cleaned up).\n\f                               2\n     According to Hill and Robinson, Mears intruded on Butler\nselling drugs to two boys in the bathroom of a vacant\napartment. Butler confessed to Hill that he \u201ctied the old man\nup,\u201d gagged him with a stocking, strangled him with a belt\n(until the belt broke) and then with a telephone cord, \u201cpoured\nsome water down his throat to make sure that he was dead,\u201d\nand absconded with his keys. Supplemental Appendix (S.A.)\n22\u201323. Butler confessed to Robinson that \u201che was choking the\nman with a belt and the belt broke and then he started choking\nhim with the telephone cord.\u201d Id. at 150\u201351. The crime scene\nclosely corroborated these accounts. The gag inside Mears\u2019s\nmouth was \u201csoggy\u201d\u2014wetter than saliva could explain. Id. at\n8. Mears\u2019s corpse lacked a belt, keys, or wallet. And in the\nkitchen, police discovered a half-open cabinet drawer that\ncontained a man\u2019s leather belt split into two pieces and left on\ntop of various other items.\n\n     Over the course of four days, the prosecution presented\nlive testimony from twenty-one witnesses and stipulated\ntestimony from two more. Hill and Robinson testified at length\nabout Butler\u2019s confessions to each of them. Three witnesses\nplaced Butler near the apartment around the time of the murder.\nFive witnesses\u2014a medical examiner, a detective, two police\nofficers, and one neighbor\u2014described the crime scene. Five\nwitnesses testified about the recovery of Mears\u2019s keys, and one\ntestified about leaving wet paint in the vacant apartment three\ndays before the murder. Five expert witnesses testified about\nthe keys, the crime scene, the water poured down Mears\u2019s\nthroat, the paint found on the clothes of Mears and Butler, the\ntorn belt, and hair taken from Mears\u2019s clothing and from Butler.\n\n     FBI Special Agent Myron Scholberg briefly testified for\nthe prosecution, for less than 16 pages of an 800-page trial\ntranscript. Scholberg began by explaining that the belt had\nbeen torn rather than cut. Scholberg then explained his\n\f                                3\nmicroscopic examination of the hair found on Mears\u2019s clothing\nand of hair samples taken from Butler. Scholberg opined that\nthe hair on Mears\u2019s clothing \u201ccould have come from\u201d Butler,\nthough he affirmatively disclaimed any \u201cpositive\nidentification.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Appendix (A.A.) 84. Scholberg\nfurther opined that it was virtually impossible for \u201cthe hair of\nthe suspect and the hair of the victim\u201d to be indistinguishable.\nId. at 85. On cross-examination, Scholberg acknowledged that\nhe had \u201cno statistics\u201d about how many people had hair\nindistinguishable from the hair on Mears\u2019s clothing. Id. at 86.\nOn re-cross, in response to a further question from defense\ncounsel about \u201chow many other people have the same\nmicroscopic characteristics of their hair follicles as the one that\nyou identified as Mr. Butler\u2019s hair from the clothing of Mr.\nMears,\u201d Scholberg reiterated: \u201cI have no idea whether anyone\nwould have the same microscopic characteristics.\u201d Id. at 90.\n\n     The defense presented five witnesses to undercut the\ncredibility of Hill and Robinson and to show that neighbors\ndiscussed Mears\u2019s killing in the hours after the murder. The\njury returned a guilty verdict in one day, and the district court\nsentenced Butler to twenty years to life in prison.\n\n     On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction and\nsentence. We rejected Butler\u2019s contention that the district court\nhad abused its discretion in failing to order Hill and Robinson\nto be tested for drug use. Both were \u201cadmitted heroin users,\u201d\nand we recognized that this undercut the credibility of their\ntestimony. 481 F.2d at 534. But, we continued, \u201c[t]he\nchallenged witnesses\u2019 testimony, while ambiguous at times,\ndid present a comprehensive and believable narrative. More\nimportantly, that narrative was supported by overwhelming\nextrinsic corroboration, giving substantial independent\nassurance of its reliability.\u201d Id. at 535.\n\f                                4\n     In 1978, Butler escaped from prison and remained a\nfugitive until 2006, when he was caught, convicted of escape,\nand returned to prison.\n\n                                B\n\n     In recent years, concerns arose about the use of hair\nevidence in criminal trials, which was common before the\ndevelopment of DNA testing. In response, the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with\nthe Innocence Project and the National Association of Criminal\nDefense Lawyers, began studying the appropriate uses of such\nevidence. In 2012, DOJ issued a statement titled \u201cMicroscopic\nHair Comparison Analysis.\u201d A.A. 101. In it, DOJ and the\nprivate organizations agreed that some uses of hair evidence\nare entirely appropriate. Specifically, \u201c[t]he scientific analysis\nof hair evidence permits a well-trained examiner to offer an\nopinion that a known individual can either be included or\nexcluded as a possible source of a questioned hair collected at\na crime scene.\u201d Id. But because \u201cthe size of the pool of people\nwho could be included as a possible source of a specific hair is\nunknown,\u201d a statement \u201cthat applies probabilities to a\nparticular inclusion of someone as a source of a hair of\nunknown origin cannot be scientifically supported.\u201d Id. The\nstatement identifies three instances in which testimony\n\u201cexceeds the limits of science\u201d: if the examiner states that\n\u201cevidentiary hair could be associated with a specific individual\nto the exclusion of all others\u201d (dubbed Error Type 1), assigns\n\u201ca statistical weight or probability\u201d to such an association\n(Error Type 2), or cites \u201cthe number of samples from different\nindividuals that could not be distinguished from one another as\na predictive value to bolster the conclusion that a hair belongs\nto a specific individual\u201d (Error Type 3). Id.\n\f                                 5\n     In 2015, the FBI concluded that Scholberg had committed\ntwo of these errors. First, it asserted that nine lines of testimony\nfrom the direct examination, in which Scholberg discussed the\nprobability that hair from Butler and Mears would be\nindistinguishable, reflected Error Type 2. A.A. 73 (citing Trial\nTr. 531, lines 8\u201316, reproduced at A.A. 85). Second, the FBI\nasserted that three lines of testimony from the re-cross, in\nwhich Scholberg disclaimed any knowledge of the probability\nthat hair from different people would have the same\nmicroscopic characteristics, reflected Error Type 1. Id. (citing\nTrial Tr. 536, lines 9\u201311, reproduced at A.A. 90). At the same\ntime, the FBI noted that Scholberg repeatedly had included\n\u201cLimiting Language\u201d in his testimony. Id. The FBI notified\nthe Innocence Project and the NACDL of its conclusions, and\nthose groups noted their agreement. DOJ then notified Butler\u2019s\ncounsel and waived in advance any limitations or procedural-\ndefault defenses that might otherwise apply to claims for post-\nconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The notice expressly\ntook \u201cno position regarding the materiality of the error in this\ncase.\u201d A.A. 68.\n\n     Not surprisingly, Butler moved to vacate his conviction\nunder section 2255. He contended that Scholberg\u2019s testimony\nconstituted a knowing use of false evidence to convict him, and\nthus violated due process. The government did not dispute that\nsome of Scholberg\u2019s testimony was false or misleading. Nor\ndid it dispute that the government knew, or should have known,\nthat some of the testimony was misleading. But, the\ngovernment argued, any misleading evidence was not material.\n\n    The district court denied relief on that basis. For twelve\npages, the court painstakingly reviewed the evidence and\narguments presented at Butler\u2019s trial. 278 F. Supp. 3d at 463\u2013\n74. The court concluded that Scholberg\u2019s testimony was\ncarefully hedged, id. at 482; that the testimony of Hill and\n\f                               6\nRobinson \u201cremained supported by \u2018overwhelming extrinsic\ncorroboration\u2019\u201d even without the hair evidence, id. at 483\n(quoting Butler, 481 F.2d at 535); and that the government\u2019s\nentire case, \u201cwhen viewed as a whole, and even without the hair\ntestimony,\u201d established Butler\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable\ndoubt,\u201d id. at 484.\n\n                               II\n\n     Under Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959), the\ngovernment \u201cmay not knowingly use false evidence, including\nfalse testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction.\u201d Id. at 269.\nMoreover, \u201c[t]he same result obtains when the State, although\nnot soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected.\u201d Id.\nBut use or allowance of false testimony does not invariably\nrequire a new trial. To the contrary, it does so only if the\ndefendant proves materiality\u2014i.e., a \u201creasonable likelihood\nthat the false testimony could have affected\u201d the verdict.\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103 (1976); see Giglio v.\nUnited States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972); Napue, 360 U.S. at\n271. We have applied this settled materiality requirement in\n\u201cdecades of cases\u201d under Napue. United States v. Ausby, 916\nF.3d 1089, 1092 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam). And we have\nstressed that \u201ceven if the prosecution either sponsored or failed\nto correct false testimony, the grant of a new trial is not\nautomatic.\u201d United States v. Vega, 826 F.3d 514, 529 (D.C.\nCir. 2016) (per curiam).\n\n     Supreme Court precedent makes this clear. The Court has\nfound false testimony to be material in only four cases. Each\ntime, it stressed the critical importance of the testimony to the\ngovernment\u2019s overall case. In Alcorta v. Texas, 355 U.S. 28\n(1957) (per curiam), the \u201conly eye witness\u201d to a murder gave\nperjured testimony that he was not having an affair with the\nvictim, which was \u201cseriously prejudicial\u201d to the defendant\u2019s\n\f                               7\ncontention that he had killed his wife only in \u201csudden passion,\u201d\nupon discovering the affair. See id. at 29\u201332. In Napue, the\n\u201cprincipal state witness\u201d falsely denied that the government\nhad \u201cpromised him consideration\u201d to testify, and the conviction\nrested \u201clargely\u201d on his \u201cextremely important\u201d eyewitness\naccount. See 360 U.S. at 265\u201366. In Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S.\n1 (1967), a government chemist made a \u201cconsistent and\nrepeated misrepresentation\u201d that paint on the defendant\u2019s\nshorts was blood, and this formed a \u201cvital component\u201d of the\ngovernment\u2019s case. See id. at 3, 6. In Giglio v. United States,\n405 U.S. 150 (1972), the government\u2019s case \u201cdepended almost\nentirely\u201d on one \u201ckey witness,\u201d who falsely denied that the\ngovernment had promised not to prosecute him in return for his\ntestimony. See id. at 151, 154\u201355.\n\n     In contrast, the Court has denied relief for false testimony\neven on critical issues, as long as the remaining evidence is\nsufficiently strong. In Kaiser v. New York, 394 U.S. 280\n(1969), the prosecution falsely presented two recorded phone\nconversations as confessions. That misrepresentation struck at\nthe heart of its case, which \u201crested principally on the content\u201d\nof the conversations. Id. at 280. Nonetheless, the record as a\nwhole \u201cclearly and beyond any reasonable doubt implicated the\ndefendant,\u201d People v. Kaiser, 233 N.E.2d 818, 821 (N.Y.\n1967), and the jury, which \u201cknew the circumstances under\nwhich the incriminating statements had been made,\u201d could\nitself evaluate the misrepresentation in context. See 394 U.S.\nat 281 n.5. Likewise, in Giles v. Maryland, 386 U.S. 66 (1967),\nfive justices rejected two Napue claims for lack of materiality.\nGiles involved rape convictions resting on testimony from the\nvictim and her date on the night at issue. A plurality would\nhave ordered further consideration of whether the government\nhad knowingly elicited from them false testimony about one of\nthe defendants and about whether the victim had engaged in\nsexual activity with her date, who was not one of the\n\f                                8\ndefendants. See id. at 74\u201376 (opinion of Brennan, J.).\nAlthough the Court remanded on other grounds, a majority held\nthat neither Napue claim was material: the first involved a\ndispute fully aired out at trial, and the second involved at most\nan \u201cinconclusive intimation\u201d of the victim\u2019s promiscuity,\nwhich could \u201cscarcely have sufficed to change the trial\u2019s\noutcome.\u201d Id. at 111\u201312 (Harlan, J., dissenting); see id. at 82\u2013\n83 (White, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\n      This Court too has confirmed that Napue\u2019s materiality\nrequirement has bite. So far as I can tell, we have found the\nrequirement satisfied only twice in the six decades since Napue\nwas decided. In United States v. Iverson, 637 F.2d 799 (D.C.\nCir. 1980), we reversed a conviction where the government had\nfailed to correct perjury by a \u201ckey witness\u201d who falsely testified\nthat she \u201chad nothing to gain from testifying for the\ngovernment.\u201d Id. at 801.1 And in Ausby, we set aside a\nconviction resting in part on expert testimony falsely stating\nthat hair from the crime scene could be \u201cpositively\u201d identified\nas the defendant\u2019s. 916 F.3d at 1091\u201392. We described this\ntestimony as \u201cthe primary evidence that directly contradicted\u201d\nthe position of the defense, which could \u201cplausibly explain[]\u201d\nall the government\u2019s remaining evidence. Id. at 1095.\n\n     Over the same period, we rejected at least six Napue\nclaims for lack of materiality. In four cases, the disputed\ntestimony was insignificant relative to the prosecution\u2019s overall\ncase. See United States v. Sitzmann, 893 F.3d 811, 828\u201329\n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (\u201csingle reference during a five-\nweek trial \u2026 was unlikely to have influenced the verdict,\nespecially in light of the abundant evidence at trial\u201d (cleaned\n\n1\n   On rehearing, we remanded the case for further factfinding on\nwhether the defense knew that this testimony was false. United\nStates v. Iverson, 648 F.2d 737 (D.C. Cir. 1981).\n\f                                9\nup)); Vega, 826 F.3d at 531 (false testimony was \u201cjust gilding\nthe lily\u201d); United States v. Burch, 156 F.3d 1315, 1328\u201329\n(D.C. Cir. 1998); United States v. Anderson, 509 F.2d 312,\n326\u201327 & n.110 (D.C. Cir. 1974). In a fifth case, \u201cthe [false]\ntestimony was corrected, and [the defendant] failed to\ndemonstrate that the misleading content of the initial testimony\ncould nevertheless have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d\nUnited States v. Straker, 800 F.3d 570, 604 (D.C. Cir. 2015)\n(per curiam). In a sixth, the false testimony was immaterial\nbecause the defense received the critical evidence \u201cin time to\nmake effective use of it.\u201d United States v. Paxson, 861 F.2d\n730, 737\u201338 (D.C. Cir. 1988).\n\n     Butler attempts to equate Napue\u2019s materiality requirement\nwith the harmless-error rule of Chapman v. California, 386\nU.S. 18 (1967), under which the government, to preserve a\nconviction despite constitutional error, must show no\n\u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the error influenced the jury. See\nid. at 23. But \u201creasonable possibility\u201d is different from\n\u201creasonable likelihood,\u201d and a burden on the government is\ndifferent from one on the defendant. We thus decisively\nrejected Butler\u2019s position in Ausby. There, we explained that\n\u201cthe harmless-error standard of Chapman,\u201d which applies only\nafter a constitutional violation has been established, is\nsubstantively and conceptually different from the materiality\nrequirement of Napue, which is an essential element of\nestablishing a due-process violation in the first place. See 916\nF.3d at 1092\u201394.\n\n     For their part, my colleagues embrace Chapman in\nsubstance, though not by name. Piecing together scattered\ndicta from two cases, they morph Napue\u2019s materiality\nrequirement into \u201ca veritable hair trigger for setting aside the\nconviction,\u201d ante, at 12 (quoting United States v. Gale, 314\nF.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2003)), which is \u201cquite easily satisfied\u201d and\n\f                                  10\nwould require \u201ca virtual automatic reversal\u201d whenever the\ngovernment has offered false testimony, id. (quoting United\nStates v. Williams, 233 F.3d 592, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citation\nomitted)). But Gale and Williams cannot bear that weight.\nNeither case set aside any conviction, on Napue grounds or\notherwise. In Gale, this Court rejected a Napue claim because\nthe disputed testimony was not false. See 314 F.3d at 3. We\nreferenced the supposed \u201chair trigger\u201d only after doing so, and\nonly to make the undisputed point that Napue\u2019s materiality\nrequirement is less demanding than the materiality requirement\nfor establishing a due-process violation under Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), based on the government\u2019s\nfailure to disclose exculpatory evidence without fault. See 314\nF.3d at 4. Williams is even further afield. It involved perjury\ndiscovered only after trial. There was no constitutional issue\nat all, but only the question of whether the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d\nrequired a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n33. See 233 F.3d at 593. Finally, and most importantly, the\ndicta quoted by my colleagues do not fairly describe the six\ndecades of case law applying Napue\u2019s materiality requirement\nwith some rigor. We should therefore reject the gloss on Napue\nsuggested by Gale and Williams, just as Ausby rejected prior\ndicta mistakenly equating Napue to Chapman. See 916 F.3d at\n1094.2\n\n\n2\n   The government failed to argue that the harmless-error rule of\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993), should govern Napue\nclaims raised under section 2255. In Brecht, the Supreme Court held\nthat, on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, courts generally\nshould deny relief unless the constitutional error \u201chad substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d 507\nU.S. at 637 (quotation marks omitted). Some courts of appeals have\nheld that Brecht applies to Napue claims, see, e.g., United States v.\nClay, 720 F.3d 1021, 1025\u201327 (8th Cir. 2013), and most courts of\nappeals have held that Brecht applies to collateral review under\n\f                                 11\n                                 III\n\n     In this case, there is no reasonable likelihood that\nScholberg\u2019s disputed hair testimony could have affected the\nverdict. For one thing, even setting aside that testimony, the\nevidence of Butler\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. For another, the\ntwo scraps of disputed testimony\u2014covering twelve lines of\ntext during a four-day prosecution\u2014were at worst narrowly\nmisleading and quickly cleared up by various ensuing\nclarifications. In the context of the government\u2019s overall case,\nthe disputed statements were wholly immaterial.\n\n                                 A\n\n     As the district court explained, the testimony of Hill and\nRobinson, who recounted detailed confessions made by Butler\non the day of the murder, formed \u201cthe linchpin of the\ngovernment\u2019s case.\u201d Butler, 278 F. Supp. 3d at 483. On direct\nreview, this Court explained that their testimony \u201cpresent[ed] a\ncomprehensive and believable narrative\u201d that \u201cwas supported\nby overwhelming extrinsic corroboration, giving substantial\nindependent assurance of its reliability.\u201d Butler, 481 F.2d at\n535. Likewise, as the district court explained, even \u201cabsent the\nhair evidence, the testimony of these two witnesses remained\nsupported by \u2018overwhelming extrinsic corroboration.\u2019\u201d Butler,\n278 F. Supp. 3d at 483 (quoting Butler, 481 F.2d at 535).\n\n     Butler was friends with, and supplied heroin to, Hill and\nRobinson. When police separately interviewed Hill and\nRobinson one day after the murder, both gave consistent\nstatements reporting confessions that Butler had made to them\n\nsection 2255, see United States v. Smith, 723 F.3d 510, 517 (4th Cir.\n2013) (collecting cases). In this circuit, both questions remain open\nfor consideration in a case where the government raises the issue.\n\f                              12\nwithin one to three hours of the crime. Hill and Robinson then\nrepeated their accounts as the star witnesses at Butler\u2019s trial.\n\n     Hill provided the fullest narrative. He testified that he\ncalled Butler between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m. on the day of the\nmurder, looking for heroin. Over the telephone, Butler told\nHill that he had just left the home of Ellen Johnson\u2014the sister\nof Butler\u2019s girlfriend\u2014where \u201che had just killed the rent man\u201d\nfor her building. S.A. 22. Johnson lived in the building where\nMears\u2019s body was found. According to Hill, Butler \u201ctold me\nthat the old man caught him selling narcotics to two boys, and\nthe old man knocked it over and came over and flushed it.\u201d Id.\nHill added that Butler \u201ctold me he tied the old man up and put\na stocking or something in his mouth, and was choking him\nwith a belt, and the belt broke and he started choking him with\na telephone cord.\u201d Id. Finally, \u201che poured some water down\nhis throat to make sure that he was dead.\u201d Id. Later, around\n4:00 p.m., Butler went to Hill\u2019s home and divulged more\ndetails, including how he had taken \u201csome keys to the\napartment or \u2026 to the man\u2019s car.\u201d Id. at 23. Butler also\nrevealed that the killing took place in the bathroom of an\n\u201c[u]pstairs apartment.\u201d Id. at 28.\n\n     Robinson\u2019s testimony reinforced Hill\u2019s. She arrived at\nHill\u2019s house around 4:30 p.m. on the day of the murder, where\nshe found Hill and Butler using heroin. Hill told Robinson that\n\u201cDennis just killed a man.\u201d S.A. 150. Butler then \u201ccut in\u201d to\nexplain that he \u201chad to do something,\u201d and that \u201che was\nchoking the man with a belt and the belt broke and then he\nstarted choking him with the telephone cord.\u201d Id. at 150\u201351.\nAccording to Robinson, Hill added that Butler had killed Mears\nbecause \u201cthe man caught Dennis selling narcotics in the\nbathroom to two boys.\u201d Id. at 152.\n\f                               13\n    My colleagues note fair grounds for questioning the\ncredibility of Hill and Robinson: both used heroin, both gave\nconflicting testimony about the extent of their drug use, and\nRobinson gave the police inconsistent statements about which\ndetails of the murder she learned directly from Butler and\nwhich she learned indirectly through Hill. Ante, at 13.\nNonetheless, both knew and separately reported key details of\nthe murder that they could have learned only from the\nmurderer. Hill and Robinson each knew that the killer had\nchoked Mears with a belt until it broke. Additionally, Hill\nknew that the killer had poured water down Mears\u2019s throat.\nAnd, of course, the crime scene itself established beyond any\nreasonable doubt that they truthfully reported these details.\n\n     My colleagues speculate that Hill and Robinson might\nhave learned these details from Ellen Johnson and then\nmanufactured a story to frame Butler. Ante, at 20\u201321. That is\na virtual impossibility. Johnson, a sister of Butler\u2019s girlfriend,\nlived in a second-floor apartment in the building where Mears\nwas killed. She testified that, when another neighbor told her\nof Mears\u2019s death, she went upstairs to the vacant apartment,\nentered it, \u201cjust stood there and looked at [the body] and came\nback out.\u201d S.A. 212. During this brief visit to the crime scene,\nJohnson noticed that Mears \u201chad something white stuffed in his\nmouth and a cord around his neck and his hands were tied\nbehind his back.\u201d Id. But Johnson did not go into the\nbathroom, bedroom, or kitchen of the apartment, and she did\nnot \u201clook in anything, in any of the cabinets or any of the tables\nor anything in the kitchen.\u201d Id. at 219\u201320. Thus, it is highly\nunlikely that she would have noticed (but failed to mention in\nher testimony) that the stocking protruding from Mears\u2019s\nmouth was wetter than spit would explain and then would have\ninferred that the murderer must have poured water down his\nthroat. Likewise, it is virtually impossible that she would have\nlooked in the kitchen drawer (from her position outside the\n\f                               14\nbathroom), noticed the torn belt among other random items,\nand inferred that it must have been a failed murder weapon used\nbefore the telephone cord finished the job. Johnson\u2014who had\nno motive to shade her testimony adversely to Butler\u2014further\ntestified that she did not convey to Hill the details of what she\nsaw at the crime scene. Id. at 215. My colleagues cite other\nevidence suggesting that Johnson conveyed those details to her\nsister Lillian Harring, who in turn conveyed them to Mary\nDean (another sister, who was also Butler\u2019s girlfriend), who in\nturn conveyed them to Hill. Id. at 450\u201352. Even if those\nvarious communications occurred in the hours after the murder,\nJohnson still cannot be the source of Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s\nknowledge that the murderer tore a belt trying to strangle\nMears, or Hill\u2019s knowledge that the murderer then poured\nwater down Mears\u2019s throat to make sure that he was dead. The\nonly rational account of this evidence is the obvious one:\nButler confessed to Hill and Robinson, just as they testified.\n\n     Other evidence linked Butler to the crime. Many\neyewitnesses placed him near the building around the time of\nthe murder, and one even saw Butler and Mears working\ntogether on a car around 12:30 to 1:00 p.m. In addition, two\nweeks after the murder, Mears\u2019s keys were found on a rooftop\nthree doors down from the home where Butler lived with his\ngirlfriend, almost half a mile away from where Mears was\nmurdered. Furthermore, when Butler was arrested in the early\nmorning of September 30, the day after the murder, his pants\nhad a spot of aqua-colored paint. Three days before the murder,\nWilson Dean, the brother of Butler\u2019s girlfriend, was painting\nthe apartment where the murder took place. Dean testified that\nhe left in the apartment a pan of paint, a roller, and an open\npaint bucket with some cans and soda bottles inside it. When\npolice inspected the crime scene, they found the pan, roller, and\nbucket. They also found aqua-colored paint stains on Mears\u2019s\ncoat and on a Pepsi bottle containing water and lying inside his\n\f                               15\ncoat. An expert for the government testified that the paint on\nButler\u2019s pants, the paint on Mears\u2019s coat, and the paint on the\nPepsi bottle all were similar or identical \u201cin color, texture, and\ntype of paint.\u201d S.A. 342.\n\n     My colleagues seek to discount all this corroborating\nevidence piece by piece. Butler\u2019s presence at the apartment\nbuilding, they say, could have been a coincidence. The keys,\nthey say, could have been taken and thrown away by anyone.\nAnd the paint, they say, might have stained Butler\u2019s pants days\nearlier. Ante, at 15\u201316. True enough, but the individual pieces\nof evidence are more powerful than my colleagues\nacknowledge. To reiterate, Butler was seen together with\nMears right outside the apartment building, within a few hours\nof the time of death, and Mears\u2019s keys were recovered three\ndoors down from where Butler lived, almost half a mile away\nfrom the murder scene. As for the paint, Wilson Dean did\ntestify that Butler \u201ccame up\u201d to the vacant apartment as Dean\nwas painting on the Saturday before the murder, though he\n\u201cdidn\u2019t stay too long.\u201d S.A. 241. But it is far less likely that\nsuch a brief visit would cause paint-stained pants than would\nthe murderer\u2019s struggle to tie up and gag the victim, grab a soda\nbottle from an open paint bucket, fill it with water, and pour the\nwater down the victim\u2019s throat. Moreover, the paint left in the\napartment by Dean must have still been wet on the day of the\nmurder; the expert testified that the paint was \u201capplied while\nwet\u201d to the clothes of both Mears and Butler, id. at 342, and\nthere is no evidence suggesting that Mears might have been\ndabbed while Dean painted on the prior Saturday.\nFurthermore, Dean\u2019s testimony is incriminating in another\nrespect. It establishes that Butler, who himself used and sold\nheroin, would have known that the third-floor apartment was\nvacant\u2014and thus an ideal spot from which to make the sales.\nFinally, whatever the probative force of any one piece of\nevidence considered in isolation, \u201cindividual pieces of\n\f                              16\nevidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in\ncumulation prove it.\u201d Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171,\n179 (1987). Here, these various pieces of evidence, together\nwith the confessions reported by Hill and Robinson, make the\ncase against Butler overwhelming.\n\n                               B\n\n     Compared to all this evidence, the disputed hair testimony\nplayed only a minor role at trial. Much of Scholberg\u2019s\ntestimony was appropriate\u2014and made the case against Butler\neven stronger. According to the FBI, Scholberg \u201cexceeded the\nlimits of science\u201d in only two asserted overstatements made in\ntwelve lines of testimony. A.A. 67\u201373. But these fleeting\nscraps were at worst confusing or ambiguous, and any marginal\nprejudice that they may have caused was immediately cured by\ncorrective and cautionary statements from the prosecution,\nfrom defense counsel, and from Scholberg himself\u2014including\nin twenty-five lines of testimony that the FBI itself recognized\nas appropriate \u201cLimiting Language.\u201d Id. at 73.\n\n     In his direct testimony, Scholberg began by explaining the\nbasics of microscopic hair analysis, through which samples of\nhair can be classified as similar or dissimilar in some sixteen\ndifferent respects. After explaining that the hair taken from\nMears\u2019s clothing and the hair samples taken from Butler were\nsimilar in all those respects, Scholberg offered the measured\nand appropriate conclusion that the hair from Mears\u2019s clothing\n\u201ccould have come from the head of the defendant.\u201d A.A. 84.\nScholberg then elaborated on why he had hedged his\nconclusion:\n\n    Now, I say could have because hairs do not contain\n    enough identifying characteristics to be positively\n    identified as originating from a certain head of a\n    certain individual to the exclusion of all other\n\f                               17\n    individuals in this race group. This is not a positive\n    identification. My testimony is they are the same or\n    alike in all the microscopic characteristics that were\n    available to me.\n\nId. (emphasis added). Measured against the DOJ guidelines on\nappropriate and inappropriate uses of hair evidence, this\ntestimony was permissible\u2014indeed, it was exemplary.\n\n     The first snippet deemed by the FBI to be false involved\neight lines of testimony immediately after this passage, at the\nend of the direct examination. After Scholberg explained his\ninability to make a positive identification, the prosecutor asked\nhim \u201chow likely or how unlikely is it for two hairs to be\nmicroscopically alike, yet come from different people?\u201d A.A.\n85. A direct response could have amounted to Error Type 2,\nhad it offered any \u201cprobability\u201d that the hair found on Mears\u2019s\nclothing belonged to Butler. Id. at 101. But Scholberg\u2019s\nanswer was nonresponsive. He stated that, in his roughly\n10,000 examinations, there were only \u201cfour or five times when\nthe hair of the suspect and the hair of the victim was so nearly\nalike \u2026 that I was unable to come to a conclusion as to where\nthese hairs originated.\u201d Id. at 85 (emphases added). This\nsuggested a very low probability that the hair of Mears and\nButler would be indistinguishable. But as defense counsel\nstressed in closing argument, Mears and Butler were different\nraces, their hair looked entirely different, and nobody had\nargued to the contrary. In other words, far from overstating the\nlikelihood that the hair found on Mears\u2019s clothing belonged to\nButler, Scholberg\u2019s nonresponsive answer tended to rule out\nthat the hair belonged to Mears\u2014a possibility not at issue in\nthe case. In context, any overstatement in Scholberg\u2019s direct\ntestimony was immaterial.\n\f                                18\n     In any event, immediately after this garbled exchange, the\ndefense cleared up any confusion and thus cured any prejudice.\nAt the beginning of the cross-examination, defense counsel\nshifted attention away from the question whether \u201cthe hair of\nthe defendant and the hair of the victim\u201d were alike. A.A. 85.\nCounsel then elicited further testimony stressing Scholberg\u2019s\nlimited ability to connect the crime-scene hair to Butler:\n\n    Q: But, your testimony is that you cannot say\n    positively that ... the known hair from Mr. Butler is\n    the same as the hair that was taken from the clothes of\n    the decedent, Mr. Mears? You cannot say positively?\n\n    A: That these hairs originated from the head of the\n    defendant?\n\n    Q: Right.\n\n    A: That is correct.\n\n    Q: They could have originated from someone else\u2019s\n    head as well?\n\n    A: If all of the characteristics were the same, yes.\n\n    Q: That could be any number of people. You don\u2019t\n    have any idea how many people that could be?\n\n    A: I have no statistics to illustrate this any further, no.\n\nId. at 86. This testimony was clear, perfectly appropriate,\nconsistent with DOJ guidelines, and recognized by the FBI as\nproper \u201cLimiting Language.\u201d Id. at 73.\n\f                                19\n    The second snippet flagged by the FBI is even more\nobviously immaterial. It involved a small portion of the re-\ncross, the entirety of which is this:\n\n    Q: The relevant statistical comparison would not be\n    between the victim\u2019s hair and the defendant\u2019s hair. It\n    would be between the microscopic identification you\n    could make of one hair and the rest of the community\n    that might have the same kind of hair. In other words,\n    we don\u2019t know how many other people have the same\n    microscopic characteristics of their hair follicles as the\n    one that you identified as Mr. Butler\u2019s hair from the\n    clothing of Mr. Mears, isn\u2019t that correct?\n\n    A: Yes, that is correct. I have no idea whether anyone\n    would have the same microscopic characteristics.\n\n    Q: It could be no one or it could be 200 people.\n\n    A: It could be no one or it could be someone. I don\u2019t\n    have any basis to ... assign a number to it. That is\n    correct.\n\nA.A. 90. The obvious takeaway points are that (i) the\ndissimilarity of Butler\u2019s hair and Mears\u2019s hair is beside the\npoint, and (ii) the probability that the crime-scene hair was\nButler\u2019s is unknown. None of that is problematic, and the FBI\nitself designated three lines of this testimony as appropriate\n\u201cLimiting Language.\u201d Id. at 73. Yet the FBI still found Error\nType 1\u2014associating crime-scene hair to Butler \u201cto the\nexclusion of all others\u201d\u2014from the three lines of testimony in\nwhich Scholberg indicated agreement with the statement that\n\u201cwe don\u2019t know how many other people have the same\nmicroscopic characteristics of their hair follicles as the one that\nyou identified as Mr. Butler\u2019s hair from the clothing of Mr.\nMears.\u201d Id. at 71\u201373, 90 (emphasis added). This makes no\n\f                               20\nsense. Any overstatement, in suggesting that Scholberg had\npreviously identified the crime-scene hair as Butler\u2019s, was built\ninto a long, leading question formulated by defense counsel.\nBy casually answering \u201cYes, that is correct,\u201d Scholberg made\nat worst an invited error, which is hardly grounds for setting\naside a conviction. See, e.g., United States v. Ginyard, 215\nF.3d 83, 88 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (per curiam). In any event, the\nthrust of the exchange was not to suggest that Scholberg had\npositively identified Butler as the murderer. Precisely the\nopposite: defense counsel posited that \u201cwe don\u2019t know how\nmany      other     people\u201d    have    hair    microscopically\nindistinguishable from Butler\u2019s, and Scholberg repeatedly\nagreed that he had \u201cno idea.\u201d A.A. 90. This disputed testimony\nis actually helpful to Butler.\n\n      In fairness, I should note that the short redirect\nexamination raises two similar concerns, although the FBI did\nnot identify it as containing any false testimony. First,\nScholberg briefly repeated the point that he could almost never\nfail to distinguish the hair of a defendant from that of a victim.\nFor the reasons explained above, that statement is immaterial\nin this case, even if slightly misleading. Second, the prosecutor\nasked whether Scholberg was testifying that the crime-scene\nhair was \u201conly similar\u201d to Butler\u2019s. A.A. 89. Scholberg\nresponded: \u201cNo, I am not. When you imply that something is\nsimilar, you are implying that it is also different in some\nrespects. My report and my testimony is that these hairs are\nthe same. They are alike in all identifiable microscopic\ncharacteristics.\u201d Id. In isolation, this exchange might\nmisleadingly suggest that Scholberg could positively identify\nthe crime-scene hair as Butler\u2019s. But all Scholberg said was\nthat the hairs \u201care alike in all identifiable microscopic\ncharacteristics,\u201d and his direct examination explained at length\nwhy that did not and could not amount to a positive\nidentification. Moreover, defense counsel immediately cleared\n\f                              21\nup this point in the re-cross, where Scholberg twice\nacknowledged that he could not positively identify the crime-\nscene hairs as belonging to Butler\u2014or even estimate the\nprobability that they belonged to Butler.\n\n     Closing argument reveals much the same pattern: the hair\nevidence played a small role in the government\u2019s overall case,\nand any overstatements were at worst fleeting, marginally\nmisleading, and amply corrected. The government addressed\nhair evidence in barely more than one page of its 25-page\nclosing. Moreover, its discussion of that evidence was\ncarefully hedged. The government reminded the jury that\nScholberg \u201ccouldn\u2019t say whose hair it was,\u201d and it merely\nasked the jury to \u201cconsider\u201d the hair evidence rather than to\n\u201cfind [Butler] guilty on that evidence.\u201d S.A. 495\u201396. In\ncontrast, the government described Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s\nknowledge of the torn belt and Hill\u2019s knowledge of the water\nin Mears\u2019s throat as \u201cpivotal.\u201d Id. at 530. Likewise, the\ngovernment called the discovery of the keys next to Butler\u2019s\nhome \u201cvery crucial.\u201d Id. at 492. The government did briefly\nmention the four-in-ten-thousand probability of \u201ctwo different\npeople\u201d having microscopically indistinguishable hair. Id. at\n496. But in Butler\u2019s closing argument, after reminding the jury\nyet again that Scholberg \u201ccould not testify that it was Dennis\nButler\u2019s hair,\u201d defense counsel hammered away\u2014at length and\nwith great effectiveness\u2014at the irrelevance of Scholberg\u2019s one\nstatement of probability:\n\n    Now, ladies and gentlemen there was some testimony\n    regarding the hair and four out of ten thousand. Let\u2019s\n    get that straight. The FBI expert testified that out of\n    ten thousand cases that he handled only in four cases\n    was the hair of the decedent and the hair of the suspect\n    alike. That is what he testified to. I want you to\n    remember that. From all of the testimony adduced\n\f                                22\n    from the stand there is no question but that the\n    decedent was a white man and Dennis Butler is a black\n    man. There can be no similarity of hair. So he can\n    add ten thousand to five. Keep that in mind. The\n    Government tried to change that testimony around but\n    that is what the record shows.\n\nId. at 520. My colleagues note that the government, in its\nclosing argument and rebuttal, stressed that the crime-scene\nhair and Butler\u2019s hair were \u201cthe same in every microscopic\ndetail\u201d or characteristic. Id. at 495\u201396, 535; ante, at 9. But this\ndid not highlight false testimony at all. Instead, it reflected the\nlegitimate use of expert testimony that Butler, because his hair\nmatched the crime-scene hair in all microscopically observable\nrespects, could fairly be \u201cincluded \u2026 as a possible source\u201d of\nthat hair. A.A. 101.\n\n                                C\n\n     This case is unlike any other in which we or the Supreme\nCourt have found false testimony to be material. Scholberg\u2019s\ndisputed statements do not amount to perjury by \u201cthe only eye\nwitness to the killing.\u201d Alcorta, 355 U.S. at 29. Nor do they\ninvolve lies about plea deals secretly offered to key fact\nwitnesses. Giglio, 405 U.S. at 151; Napue, 360 U.S. at 265;\nIverson, 637 F.2d at 801. And they are nothing like false\ntestimony that paint stains were blood stains. Miller, 386 U.S.\nat 6. To the contrary, like the disputed testimony in Sitzmann,\nthey involve brief comments made during a lengthy trial and\ndwarfed by \u201cabundant evidence\u201d of guilt. See 893 F.3d at 829.\n\n     Moreover, Napue involved only \u201cuncorrected\u201d false\ntestimony, 360 U.S. at 269, which jurors are \u201cnot themselves\nin a position to evaluate,\u201d Kaiser, 394 U.S. at 282 n.5. See\nLong v. Pfister, 874 F.3d 544, 548 (7th Cir. 2017) (en banc)\n(\u201cAll Napue itself holds is that perjury known to the\n\f                                23\nprosecution must be corrected before the jury retires.\u201d). Here,\nin contrast, any misleading testimony was quickly corrected, so\nButler had to show \u201cthat the misleading content of the initial\ntestimony could nonetheless have affected the judgment of the\njury.\u201d Straker, 800 F.3d at 604. In any case involving\ncorrected testimony, that would be an uphill battle. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Chavez, 894 F.3d 593, 601 (4th Cir. 2018) (\u201cIt\nis difficult to imagine how a conviction could have been\n\u2018obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony\u2019 when that\ntestimony was almost immediately corrected by the witness\nhimself.\u201d); United States v. Joyner, 201 F.3d 61, 82 (2d Cir.\n2000) (\u201ccross-examination and jury instructions regarding\nwitness credibility will normally purge the taint of false\ntestimony\u201d); United States v. Cassino, 467 F.2d 610, 622 (2d\nCir. 1972) (\u201cthe fact that the jury learned the details of the story\nprecludes a successful [Napue] challenge\u201d). Here it is an\nimpossibility, given the amount of independent incriminating\nevidence, the fleeting and marginal nature of any misleading\nstatements, and the promptness and thoroughness of the\nensuing corrections.\n\n     Finally, Butler can take no refuge in Ausby. There, the\ndisputed testimony constituted \u201cthe primary evidence that\ndirectly contradicted [the] defense theory,\u201d which \u201cplausibly\nexplained the remaining evidence\u201d presented by the\ngovernment. 916 F.3d at 1095. But here, there was a mountain\nof untainted evidence that the defense could not plausibly\nexplain away. Moreover, the improper testimony in Ausby\n\u201cplayed a key role\u201d at trial, as \u201cborne out by the prosecution\u2019s\nemphasis\u201d of the point that the hair evidence amounted to a\n\u201cpositive\u201d identification. Id. Here, in contrast, the prosecution\ndisavowed such an overstatement, and the hair evidence played\na much smaller part in the overall case. If Ausby was by its\n\f                                   24\nown reckoning a borderline case of materiality, see 916 F.3d at\n1094\u201395, then Butler\u2019s case falls far short.3\n\n                          *    *        *   *\n\n     Because Butler failed to show that the disputed hair\nevidence in this case was material, we should affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s judgment declining to set aside his sentence. Firmly\nbut respectfully, I dissent.\n\n\n\n\n3\n   My colleagues contend that Ausby is indistinguishable because,\nthere as well as here, the hair testimony was equivocal and other\nevidence of guilt was strong. Ante, at 22\u201324. But in his closing\nrebuttal, the prosecutor in Ausby argued that hair-comparison\nevidence \u201c\u2018is not a positive means of identification but it amounts to\na positive means here.\u2019\u201d 916 F.3d at 1095 (emphasis added) (quoting\nrebuttal argument). This in turn built on expert testimony that the\ncrime-scene hair matching the defendant\u2019s hair had \u201cunusual\u201d\ncharacteristics present in \u201cless than five percent\u201d of individuals of\nthe defendant\u2019s race. United States v. Ausby, 275 F. Supp. 3d 7, 16\n(D.D.C. 2017), rev\u2019d, 916 F.3d 1089 (D.C. Cir. 2019). Under the\nFBI\u2019s current thinking, that was an obvious Error Type 2\u2014and was\nquite unlike any testimony given by Scholberg. Other evidence\nmade clear that Ausby had entered the victim\u2019s apartment and exited\nit through a window, either on or shortly before the day of the\nmurder. See 916 F.3d at 1091. We concluded that the defense\ntheory\u2014that Ausby had burgled the apartment a few days before,\nwhen he was seen loitering in the apartment building\u2014\u201cplausibly\nexplained\u201d the evidence. Id. at 1095. In contrast, Butler has no\nplausible innocent explanation of how Hill and Robinson could have\nknown about the torn belt or how Hill could have known about the\nwater poured down Mears\u2019s throat.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued November 7, 2018               Decided April 14, 2020\n\n                        No. 17-3080\n\n                UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n                        APPELLEE\n\n                              v.\n\n                     DENNIS T.

At his trial,\nan FBI forensic expert testified that hairs found on the victim\nwere microscopically identical to Butler\u2019s hair.           The\ngovernment recently acknowledged, though, that hair evidence\nof the kind introduced against Butler was false and exceeded\nthe limits of science, and that the prosecution knew or should\nhave known as much at the time of his trial.\n\n     Butler brought a motion to set aside his conviction and\nvacate his sentence based on the government\u2019s admission that\nit had used false evidence against him. We examine a single\nquestion: whether the false hair evidence presented by the\ngovernment was material. The district court found the\nevidence immaterial. In our view, however, there is a\nreasonable likelihood that the false hair evidence introduced\nagainst Butler could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. We thus\nreverse the judgment of the district court.\n\n                              I.\n\n                              A.\n\n     For decades, the FBI Laboratory employed a form of\nforensic analysis dubbed \u201chair microscopy.\u201d Hair microscopy\ncalled for forensic examiners to conduct side-by-side,\nmicroscopic comparisons of hair samples in an effort to\nascertain whether hairs from a crime scene matched hairs from\n\f                               3\na suspect. The government used ostensible matches at trial as\nscientific evidence linking defendants to crimes.\n\n     There was, however, a significant problem with that field\nof analysis: science had not validated its foundational\npremises. Existing studies failed to support a trained\nexaminer\u2019s ability to identify a \u201cmatch\u201d based on any objective\nsystem of visual hair comparison or to validly estimate the\nfrequency of hair characteristics (and therefore of matches) in\nthe general population.\n\n      Although those limitations were long known to the\ngovernment, prosecutors continued to rely on hair evidence at\ntrial. By 2009, however, multiple developments spurred the\ngovernment to reassess its position on the evidentiary\nreliability of hair microscopy. First, the National Academy of\nSciences published a groundbreaking report critical of the\npractice. The report confirmed that \u201c[n]o scientifically\naccepted statistics exist about the frequency with which\nparticular characteristics of hair are distributed in the\npopulation,\u201d and noted the absence of any uniform standards\nfor identifying how many characteristics must be shared\nbetween two hairs before they can be called a \u201cmatch.\u201d Nat\u2019l\nResearch Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the\nUnited States: A Path Forward 160 (2009). Additionally, DNA\ntesting exonerated several men who had been convicted using\nhair evidence, some of whom had been imprisoned for decades.\n\n    Those events prompted the federal government to\nundertake its largest postconviction review in history.\nWorking in tandem with defendants\u2019 rights groups, the\ngovernment audited thousands of convictions from the pre-\n2000 period to identify cases in which the government made\nuse of false hair evidence. This is one of the identified cases.\n\f                                4\n                               B.\n\n     On September 30, 1970, appellant Butler was arrested for\nthe murder of Jesse Mears. The previous day, police had\ndiscovered Mears\u2019s body in an apartment building Mears\nmanaged in Northeast Washington D.C. The victim was found\nin a vacant apartment\u2019s bathroom with toilet paper and a\nstocking stuffed in his mouth, both \u201csoggy\u201d wet with a clear\nliquid. Trial Tr. 36, July 8, 1971, S.A. 8. His hands were\nbound, a telephone cord was wrapped around his neck, and his\nkeys were missing. The police found a soda bottle near his\nbody filled with water, a paint pan in the kitchen sink, and a\nbelt split into two pieces in the kitchen. The cause of death was\ndetermined to be \u201casphyxiation secondary to garroting.\u201d Trial\nTr. 38, July 8, 1971, S.A. 10.\n\n     The prosecution\u2019s lead witnesses were James Hill and\nPhyllis Gail Robinson. On direct examination, Hill testified\nthat he had known Butler for several years, and had called\nButler at around 3:00 or 3:30PM on the day of the murder.\nWhen Butler came to the phone \u201che sounded like he was out of\nbreath.\u201d Trial Tr. 66, July 8, 1971, A.A. 181.

According to Hill\u2019s\ntestimony, Hill asked Butler whether Hill could share the story\n\f                                5\nwith Robinson. Butler agreed, and Hill told Robinson that\nButler had just killed a man. Butler then recounted some of the\ndetails of the crime to Robinson.\n\n     Hill related that, the following day, police officers came to\nhis house, asked if he knew anything about a pair of keys, and\nsearched under his mattress. Later, at the police station, Hill\ngave a statement to police officers describing the previous\nday\u2019s events. Hill testified that Robinson was also at the\nstation but was separated from Hill. He said that he did not\noverhear the officers say anything to Robinson and that he had\nnot been threatened by the officers.\n\n     Robinson\u2019s testimony about the day of the murder tracked\nHill\u2019s in material respects. She admitted that, initially, she had\ntold the police that her knowledge of the murder came from\nHill rather than Butler. But after a police officer informed her\nthat her statement was inconsistent with Hill\u2019s in that regard,\nshe revised the story and said that Butler had told her.\nRobinson testified that her original statement had been a lie\nfueled by fear because, in her words, she \u201chad never been in no\ntrouble.\u201d Trial Tr. 263, July 9, 1971, S.A. 176.\n\n     To rebut the government\u2019s evidence, the defense attacked\nthe couple\u2019s credibility. Both witnesses prevaricated about\ntheir drug use in their trial testimony. Hill originally denied\nhaving a specific reason for calling Butler the day of the murder\nand claimed that the two of them had discussed nothing other\nthan the murder. But later, Hill admitted he had called Butler\nto obtain narcotics and had used heroin with Butler before\nRobinson arrived.\n\n     Hill was also unable to deliver a consistent narrative about\nhis drug use after the murder. At one point, he testified that he\nhad stopped using heroin seven or eight months before the trial.\nBut at another point, he claimed he had stopped using narcotics\n\f                                6\nabout one year before the trial. When the defense noted that a\none-year period would have been before the September\nmurder\u2014and thus before a day on which Hill had already\nadmitted to using heroin\u2014he nonetheless insisted that it had\nbeen \u201cabout a year,\u201d before ultimately conceding it could have\nbeen \u201cless than a year.\u201d Trial Tr. 112\u2013113, July 8, 1971, A.A.\n227\u2013228.\n\n     Additionally, Hill testified that Robinson had snorted\nheroin the day of the murder while the three were together at\nthe house. But he also stated that Robinson only used heroin\non weekends. When the defense noted that the day of the\nmurder was a Tuesday, he revised his earlier testimony and said\nthat he did not remember whether she had snorted heroin that\nday. Hill also admitted that he may have given inconsistent\nstatements to defense lawyers about what he had overheard at\nthe police station and whether officers had threatened him with\ncriminal liability.\n\n     For her part, Robinson, like Hill, gave contradictory\ntestimony about her drug use. At first, she testified that she\nonly took heroin on weekends. But she was forced to renege\nand acknowledge she had taken heroin on the Tuesday of the\nmurder. And like Hill, Robinson had given inconsistent\nstatements on a question in dispute at trial: who (Hill or Butler)\nhad told her about the murder.\n\n     The government responded by introducing an array of\ncorroborating evidence. Several witnesses testified to having\nseen Butler on the day of the crime near the apartment building.\nA witness testified to seeing Butler and the victim working\nside-by-side on a car together around 1:00PM in front of the\nbuilding. An acquaintance of Butler\u2019s testified that he had seen\nButler walking toward the area of the building between 2:00\nand 3:00PM. And several witnesses testified that they found\n\f                               7\nthe victim\u2019s stolen key ring after it was thrown from the roof of\na building near Butler\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\n     Of the sixteen fingerprint impressions recovered from the\ncrime scene, none belonged to Butler. But the government\npresented two other kinds of forensic evidence at trial. First, a\ngovernment expert testified that paint found on the victim\u2019s\nclothing, on the soda bottle at the crime scene, and on the\ndefendant\u2019s pants, all could have come from the same source\nbased on their type, texture, and color, and were likely wet\nwhen applied.\n\n     Second, and of particular relevance, the forensic expert\ntestified in detail about hair samples found on the victim\u2019s\nclothing, including his jacket, shirt, and pants. The expert\ndescribed a \u201cdirect microscopic comparison test\u201d he had\nconducted, comparing the hairs from the victim\u2019s clothing to\nsample hairs from Butler. Trial Tr. 527, July 13, 1971, S.A.\n349.

The\ngovernment also acknowledges that the prosecution knew or\nshould have known of hair microscopy evidence\u2019s\ninadequacies at the time of trial. And the government waives\nstatute-of-limitations and procedural-default defenses. In light\nof the government\u2019s concessions and waivers, the sole question\nfor us is whether the prosecution\u2019s use of the false hair\ntestimony against Butler was material.

Corroboration, corroboration, corroboration.\u201d Trial Tr.\n781, July 14, 1971, S.A. 533.\n\n      Among the corroborating evidence that the prosecution\nand our court deemed critical, the false hair testimony was\nespecially weighty. Apart from Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s\ntestimony, the government\u2019s principal corroborating evidence\npointing to Butler\u2019s culpability consisted of: (i) forensic\nevidence indicating that paint chips found on Butler, the victim,\nand at the crime scene could have come from the same source;\n(ii) testimony from eyewitnesses who saw Butler in the vicinity\nof the crime scene near the estimated time of the crime; (iii) the\ndiscovery of the victim\u2019s keys in an area Butler frequented; and\n(iv) the false testimony that Butler\u2019s hair microscopically\nmatched hair found on the victim. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312274\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Butler,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/312274/united-states-v-dennis-t-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     With regard to the first of those categories of corroborating\nevidence, an expert\u2019s forensic paint analysis suggested that\npaint chips found on Butler, on the victim, and on objects found\nat the crime scene could have all originated from the same\nsource. Yet the government\u2019s own witnesses also testified that\nthe paint was likely wet when applied to the clothing and that\nButler had been in the apartment days before at the time the\napartment was painted. Jurors therefore could have concluded\nthat the spot of paint had been applied to Butler\u2019s clothing days\nbefore the murder\u2014indeed, that may have been the most\nplausible explanation based on the government\u2019s evidence.\n\n     The government also offered evidence suggesting that\nButler had been seen going to and from the area of the murder\nat times roughly corresponding with the estimated time of the\ncrime. The evidence at trial, however, suggested that Butler\nfrequented the neighborhood. For example, the government\u2019s\nwitnesses testified that he had been inside the apartment where\n\f                                16\nthe murder took place days earlier and had also helped the\nvictim fix a car just outside the apartment on the day of the\ncrime. In light of Butler\u2019s regular, licit visits to the area, a\nreasonable juror could have construed his presence there in the\nrough timeframe of the offense, standing alone, to offer modest\ncorroboration for Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s testimony.\n\n     As for the victim\u2019s keys, a set of keys carried by the victim\nwas found on the rooftop of a house located on a block where\nButler\u2019s girlfriend lived and Butler often stayed. But no one\ntestified to having seen Butler with the keys, there was\ntestimony that some of the keys were already missing by the\ntime of the murder, the keys were found on the rooftop almost\ntwo weeks after Butler had been arrested for the murder, and\nthe rooftop, while on the same block as Butler\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s\nresidence, was also within two blocks of the murder scene. As\na result, while the keys could have been deposited on the\nrooftop by Butler, they also could have been put there by\nsomeone else who committed the crime. After all, it was not a\nsecret that the police had been searching for the keys: Hill at\nleast knew of the police\u2019s interest in finding the keys based on\nhis testimony that the officers had searched his residence for\nthem.\n\n     By comparison, the hair microscopy evidence offered\npowerful corroboration for Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s testimony\npointing to Butler as the perpetrator. The defense\u2019s sole\nexplanation for the presence of hair matching Butler\u2019s on the\nvictim\u2019s clothing, apart from noting questions about the\nprobability of a hair match in the first place, was to suggest that\nButler\u2019s hair had been transferred to the victim when the two\nof them worked on a car together earlier in the day of the\nmurder. But the government had a compelling response:\n\u201cDoes common sense tell you that when two men are just\nstanding next to one another the hair will get on the coat, the\n\f                                17\nshirt and on the pants?\u201d the prosecutor asked in summation.\n\u201cCommon sense will tell you,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat hair from a\nperson gets on another person\u2019s clothing if the person were\nstanding over him or sitting on him strangling him. What is\nmore reasonable?\u201d Trial Tr. 777\u201378, July 14, 1971, S.A. 529\u2013\n30.\n\n     The government now seeks to cast doubt on the force of\nthe hair microscopy evidence presented at trial.                The\ngovernment notes the expert\u2019s testimony at one point that \u201chair\nanalysis does not permit a positive identification of a hair as\n\u2018originating from a certain head.\u2019\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 50\u201351 (quoting\nTrial Tr. 530\u201332, July 13, 1971, S.A. 352\u2013354). But the\ngovernment itself, after reviewing the trial transcript,\ndetermined that the \u201cexaminer stated or implied that the\nevidentiary hair could be associated with a specific individual\nto the exclusion of all others,\u201d a \u201ctype of testimony\u201d that is false\nand \u201cexceeds the limits of the science.\u201d Wong Letter 5, A.A.\n71 (emphasis added). The government cannot in one breath\nconcede the hair testimony\u2019s falsity and in the next breath urge\nthat the hair testimony was accurate after all.\n\n     At any rate, in Ausby, the expert\u2019s testimony similarly\nincluded a statement that \u201cmicroscopic hair comparisons do not\nconstitute a basis of positive personal identification\u201d; and he\nthus allowed that the hairs not only could have \u201coriginated from\nthe head of Mr. Ausby\u201d but also could have come \u201cfrom some\nother person whose head hairs or pubic hairs are\nmicroscopically </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">identical.\u201d</span> <span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1091</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(formatting\nmodified). We then acknowledged that the expert \u201chad\nconceded that microscopic hair comparison analysis cannot\nproduce a positive identification.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> But we </span><pre class=\"inline\">still determined\nthat the admittedly false hair testimony presented against\nAusby, taken as a whole, was material. So too here.\n\f                               18\n     Even if the expert\u2019s testimony against Butler did at times\ninclude an acknowledgement that hair microscopy could not\nproduce a positive identification, at other points, the expert or\nprosecutor indicated that it could. That is presumably why the\ngovernment has now determined that the expert falsely \u201cstated\nor implied that the evidentiary hair could be associated with a\nspecific individual to the exclusion of all others.\u201d Wong Letter\n5, A.A. 71; see also</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 7, </span><pre class=\"inline\">A.A. 73. The expert recounted the\nsixteen characteristics of the hair he had analyzed. Describing\ntwo of those characteristics in more detail, the expert referred\nto them as a \u201cvery important identifying feature\u201d and an\n\u201cimportant identifying characteristic.\u201d Trial Tr. 529\u201330, July\n13, 1971, S.A. 351\u201352 (emphasis added). And when the\nprosecutor asked whether the expert was \u201csaying that the hairs\nthat were found of the defendant\u2019s on the clothes of the victim\nare only similar,\u201d the expert doubled down: \u201cNo, I am not.\nWhen you imply that something is similar, you are implying\nthat it is also different in some respects.

The expert answered, \u201c[i]t\nwould be very seldom\u201d; but as a preface to that conclusion, he\nsomewhat confusingly referenced the number of times he had\n\f                                19\nbeen unable to differentiate a victim\u2019s hair from the defendant\u2019s\n(four or five times out of roughly 10,000 examinations).</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\nEven if </span><pre class=\"inline\">the expert\u2019s reference to a victim\u2019s hair might have\nseemed off-base, a confused juror might well have focused on\nhis ultimate response of \u201cvery seldom.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> That may </span><pre class=\"inline\">be why\nthe government pointed to this exact exchange as one in which\nthe expert had invalidly \u201cassigned to the positive\nassociation\u201d\u2014i.e., the association of the hair \u201cwith a specific\nindividual\u201d\u2014\u201ca statistical weight or probability or provided a\nlikelihood that the questioned hair originated from a particular\nsource, or an opinion as to the likelihood or rareness of the\npositive association that could lead the jury to believe that valid\nstatistical weight can be assigned to a microscopic hair\nassociation.\u201d Wong Letter 5, A.A. 71.\n\n     In his closing argument to the jury, moreover, the\nprosecutor used the figures referenced by the expert, but in a\nmanner indicating that they directly responded to the question\nthat had been posed to the expert:\n\n    Agent Scholberg of the FBI . . . when he compared\n    the hairs that were found on the victim\u2019s clothing\n    with the defendant\u2019s hairs . . . [t]hey were the same\n    in every microscopic detail, the same. I said, How\n    often, Agent Scholberg, does it happen? You can\u2019t\n    be positive, yes, but how often does it happen that\n    two people\u2019s hair, two different people, are so\n    similar and so alike that you would be unable to\n    tell? Out of 10,000 examinations, he said he recalls\n    it happening approximately four times.\n\nTrial Tr. 731\u201332, July 14, 1971, S.A. 495\u201396 (emphasis\nadded). A juror hearing that argument by the prosecutor could\nhave readily inferred that, according to the expert, it would be\nexceedingly unlikely for two hairs deemed to be\n\f                              20\nmicroscopically identical to have come from different people.\nThat is precisely the kind of conclusion that science did not\n(and does not) support. In Ausby, we relied on the prosecutor\u2019s\nclosing argument as supporting our conclusion that the\npresentation of false hair evidence in that case was </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">material.</span>\n<span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1095</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. We do likewise here.\n\n      The government finally contends that Hill\u2019s and\nRobinson\u2019s accurate recounting of various details found at the\ncrime scene\u2014such as the presence of a torn belt, a sock in the\nvictim\u2019s mouth, and a bottle with water\u2014lends corroboration\nto their accounts that Butler had committed the crime and told\nthem about it. That may be so, but the defense also presented\nevidence suggesting: (i) the police initially suspected that it\nwas Hill himself who possessed the victim\u2019s keys (and Hill\nknew as much); (ii) Hill had spoken with individuals who\nrelayed what someone who visited the crime scene had seen;\n(iii) Hill was not credible on the issue of whether he had been\nthreatened with criminal liability; and (iv) Robinson was not\ncredible on the source of her knowledge of the crime. The\ndefense argued to the jury that other witnesses who had seen\n(or been told about) the crime scene could have related details\nabout the scene to Hill and Robinson before they spoke with\nthe police. See Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">at 467\u201368, 471, 473.\nThe defense also suggested to the jury that the police\nthemselves may have told Hill and Robinson about those\ndetails.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 483 </span><pre class=\"inline\">n.12.\n\n     Even if the last suggestion lacked \u201cconcrete support,\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span>\na reasonable </span><pre class=\"inline\">juror could have surmised that Hill and Robinson\nhad a motive to misstate the source of their information. And\nthe government, not Butler, bore the burden to demonstrate\nbeyond a reasonable doubt who had informed Hill and\nRobinson about the details of the crime scene. In the absence\nof the potentially confirming role played by the false hair\n\f                                21\nevidence, a reasonable juror could have found that the\ngovernment fell short of meeting its heavy burden on that\nscore, even without the defense advancing a compelling\nalternative theory.\n\n     Our dissenting colleague, though, would conclude that the\nfalse hair microscopy evidence introduced against Butler could\nnot have affected the jury, even under the \u201cquite easily\nsatisfied\u201d standard of materiality that governs when the\nprosecution presents false testimony. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ausby,</span> <span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1093</span>\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">(quoting </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185312\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Williams,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/185312/united-states-v-williams-gregory/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">). As our colleague sees it,\nour conclusion in applying that standard here is out of step with\nother decisions. To the contrary, our conclusion is fully in step\nwith precedent, as best illustrated by our most germane and\nrecent decision, Ausby. There, we reached the same result,\nunder the same standard, in the same circumstances (also a\nmurder trial in which the prosecution had introduced false hair\nmicroscopy testimony). Our colleague emphasizes what he\nviews to be (i) the relatively insignificant role played by the\nfalse hair evidence in this case, and (ii) the strength of the other\nevidence implicating Butler. In both of those respects,\nhowever, this case is of a piece with Ausby.\n\n     First, in arguing that the false hair testimony played only a\nminor role in Butler\u2019s trial, our colleague submits that: the\ntestimony designated as false comprised only \u201ctwelve lines of\ntext during a four-day prosecution\u201d; a number of other lines of\ntestimony were deemed to qualify as curative, \u201climiting\nlanguage,\u201d including testimony specifically stating that the hair\nevidence was \u201cnot a positive identification\u201d; the prosecutor\nmade only limited reference to the hair evidence in his closing\narguments; and defense counsel explained the limitations of\nhair-microscopy evidence in his own closing argument.\nDissenting Op. 11, 16\u201321.\n\f                                22\n     All of that, however, was also true in Ausby, yet we\n(unanimously) found the false hair evidence to be material and\nthus vacated Ausby\u2019s conviction. In particular, in Ausby: the\ntestimony designated as false comprised virtually the same\nnumber of lines of transcript text (fifteen) in a four-day trial,\nAusby App. 74; a number of other lines of testimony were\ndeemed to qualify as curative, \u201climiting language,\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185312\"> <a href=\"/opinion/185312/united-states-v-williams-gregory/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span>\nincluding testimony </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">specifically stating that hair microscopy\nevidence does \u201cnot constitute a basis of positive personal\nidentification,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ausby,</span> <span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1091</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; the \u201cprosecution only\nbriefly discussed the hair evidence in its opening and closing\narguments,\u201d United States v.

In that light, the allegedly\nlimited role played by the false hair testimony in this case\naffords no ground for reaching a different result than in Ausby.\n\n     Nor does the strength of the other evidence of guilt. Our\ndissenting colleague observes in that regard that: the\nprosecution in Butler\u2019s trial presented the testimony of twenty-\nthree witnesses over four days; the jury returned its verdict of\nguilt in one day; the district court, in finding the false hair\nevidence immaterial, \u201cpainstakingly reviewed\u201d the evidence\nand arguments presented the jury for some twelve pages of its\npublished opinion; and that court viewed the non-hair evidence\nof guilt to be \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Dissenting Op. 1\u20133, 5\u20136.\n\n     Again, though, all of that could equally be said about\nAusby.

And we follow that same course here.\n\n     In arguing that the hair evidence could not have affected\nthe jury\u2019s verdict, our colleague emphasizes the testimony of\nHill and Robinson. As explained, though, a reasonable juror\ncould have doubted their veracity, such that the hair evidence\ncould have played a confirming role. See pp. 13\u201314, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">20\u201321,</span>\nsupra</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Johnson\u2014who had\nno motive to shade her testimony adversely to Butler\u2014further\ntestified that she did not convey to Hill the details of what she\nsaw at the crime scene.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 215. </span><pre class=\"inline\">My colleagues cite other\nevidence suggesting that Johnson conveyed those details to her\nsister Lillian Harring, who in turn conveyed them to Mary\nDean (another sister, who was also Butler\u2019s girlfriend), who in\nturn conveyed them to Hill.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 450\u201352. </span><pre class=\"inline\">Even if those\nvarious communications occurred in the hours after the murder,\nJohnson still cannot be the source of Hill\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s\nknowledge that the murderer tore a belt trying to strangle\nMears, or Hill\u2019s knowledge that the murderer then poured\nwater down Mears\u2019s throat to make sure that he was dead. The\nonly rational account of this evidence is the obvious one:\nButler confessed to Hill and Robinson, just as they testified.\n\n     Other evidence linked Butler to the crime. Many\neyewitnesses placed him near the building around the time of\nthe murder, and one even saw Butler and Mears working\ntogether on a car around 12:30 to 1:00 p.m. In addition, two\nweeks after the murder, Mears\u2019s keys were found on a rooftop\nthree doors down from the home where Butler lived with his\ngirlfriend, almost half a mile away from where Mears was\nmurdered. Furthermore, when Butler was arrested in the early\nmorning of September 30, the day after the murder, his pants\nhad a spot of aqua-colored paint. Three days before the murder,\nWilson Dean, the brother of Butler\u2019s girlfriend, was painting\nthe apartment where the murder took place. Dean testified that\nhe left in the apartment a pan of paint, a roller, and an open\npaint bucket with some cans and soda bottles inside it. When\npolice inspected the crime scene, they found the pan, roller, and\nbucket. They also found aqua-colored paint stains on Mears\u2019s\ncoat and on a Pepsi bottle containing water and lying inside his\n\f                               15\ncoat. An expert for the government testified that the paint on\nButler\u2019s pants, the paint on Mears\u2019s coat, and the paint on the\nPepsi bottle all were similar or identical \u201cin color, texture, and\ntype of paint.\u201d S.A. 342.\n\n     My colleagues seek to discount all this corroborating\nevidence piece by piece. Butler\u2019s presence at the apartment\nbuilding, they say, could have been a coincidence. The keys,\nthey say, could have been taken and thrown away by anyone.\nAnd the paint, they say, might have stained Butler\u2019s pants days\nearlier. Ante, at 15\u201316. True enough, but the individual pieces\nof evidence are more powerful than my colleagues\nacknowledge. To reiterate, Butler was seen together with\nMears right outside the apartment building, within a few hours\nof the time of death, and Mears\u2019s keys were recovered three\ndoors down from where Butler lived, almost half a mile away\nfrom the murder scene. As for the paint, Wilson Dean did\ntestify that Butler \u201ccame up\u201d to the vacant apartment as Dean\nwas painting on the Saturday before the murder, though he\n\u201cdidn\u2019t stay too long.\u201d S.A. 241. But it is far less likely that\nsuch a brief visit would cause paint-stained pants than would\nthe murderer\u2019s struggle to tie up and gag the victim, grab a soda\nbottle from an open paint bucket, fill it with water, and pour the\nwater down the victim\u2019s throat. Moreover, the paint left in the\napartment by Dean must have still been wet on the day of the\nmurder; the expert testified that the paint was \u201capplied while\nwet\u201d to the clothes of both Mears and Butler,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 342, </span><pre class=\"inline\">and\nthere is no evidence suggesting that Mears might have been\ndabbed while Dean painted on the prior Saturday.\nFurthermore, Dean\u2019s testimony is incriminating in another\nrespect. It establishes that Butler, who himself used and sold\nheroin, would have known that the third-floor apartment was\nvacant\u2014and thus an ideal spot from which to make the sales.\nFinally, whatever the probative force of any one piece of\nevidence considered in isolation, \u201cindividual pieces of\n\f                              16\nevidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in\ncumulation prove it.\u201d Bourjaily v.

After explaining that the hair taken from\nMears\u2019s clothing and the hair samples taken from Butler were\nsimilar in all those respects, Scholberg offered the measured\nand appropriate conclusion that the hair from Mears\u2019s clothing\n\u201ccould have come from the head of the defendant.\u201d A.A. 84.\nScholberg then elaborated on why he had hedged his\nconclusion:\n\n    Now, I say could have because hairs do not contain\n    enough identifying characteristics to be positively\n    identified as originating from a certain head of a\n    certain individual to the exclusion of all other\n\f                               17\n    individuals in this race group.

After Scholberg explained his\ninability to make a positive identification, the prosecutor asked\nhim \u201chow likely or how unlikely is it for two hairs to be\nmicroscopically alike, yet come from different people?\u201d A.A.\n85. A direct response could have amounted to Error Type 2,\nhad it offered any \u201cprobability\u201d that the hair found on Mears\u2019s\nclothing belonged to Butler.</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"> <a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 101. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">But Scholberg\u2019s\nanswer was nonresponsive. He stated that, in his roughly\n10,000 examinations, there were only \u201cfour or five times when\nthe hair of the suspect and the hair of the victim was so nearly\nalike \u2026 that I was unable to come to a conclusion as to where\nthese hairs originated.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"> <a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 85 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(emphases added). This\nsuggested a very low probability that the hair of Mears and\nButler would be indistinguishable. But as defense counsel\nstressed in closing argument, Mears and Butler were different\nraces, their hair looked entirely different, and nobody had\nargued to the contrary. In other words, far from overstating the\nlikelihood that the hair found on Mears\u2019s clothing belonged to\nButler, Scholberg\u2019s nonresponsive answer tended to rule out\nthat the hair belonged to Mears\u2014a possibility not at issue in\nthe case. In context, any overstatement in Scholberg\u2019s direct\ntestimony was immaterial.\n\f                                18\n     In any event, immediately after this garbled exchange, the\ndefense cleared up any confusion and thus cured any prejudice.\nAt the beginning of the cross-examination, defense counsel\nshifted attention away from the question whether \u201cthe hair of\nthe defendant and the hair of the victim\u201d were alike. A.A. 85.\nCounsel then elicited further testimony stressing Scholberg\u2019s\nlimited ability to connect the crime-scene hair to Butler:\n\n    Q: But, your testimony is that you cannot say\n    positively that ... the known hair from Mr. Butler is\n    the same as the hair that was taken from the clothes of\n    the decedent, Mr. Mears?

It involved a small portion of the re-\ncross, the entirety of which is this:\n\n    Q: The relevant statistical comparison would not be\n    between the victim\u2019s hair and the defendant\u2019s hair. It\n    would be between the microscopic identification you\n    could make of one hair and the rest of the community\n    that might have the same kind of hair. In other words,\n    we don\u2019t know how many other people have the same\n    microscopic characteristics of their hair follicles as the\n    one that you identified as Mr. Butler\u2019s hair from the\n    clothing of Mr. Mears, isn\u2019t that correct?\n\n    A: Yes, that is correct.

The obvious takeaway points are that (i) the\ndissimilarity of Butler\u2019s hair and Mears\u2019s hair is beside the\npoint, and (ii) the probability that the crime-scene hair was\nButler\u2019s is unknown. None of that is problematic, and the FBI\nitself designated three lines of this testimony as appropriate\n\u201cLimiting Language.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"> <a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></span></span> at 73. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Yet the FBI still found Error\nType 1\u2014associating crime-scene hair to Butler \u201cto the\nexclusion of all others\u201d\u2014from the three lines of testimony in\nwhich Scholberg indicated agreement with the statement that\n\u201cwe don\u2019t know how many other people have the same\nmicroscopic characteristics of their hair follicles as the one that\nyou identified as Mr. Butler\u2019s hair from the clothing of Mr.\nMears.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"> <a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 71\u201373, </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">90 (emphasis added).

See, e.g., United States v. Ginyard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185191\"><a href=\"/opinion/185191/united-states-v-ginyard-harry-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (per curiam). In any event, the\nthrust of the exchange was not to suggest that Scholberg had\npositively identified Butler as the murderer. Precisely the\nopposite: defense counsel posited that \u201cwe don\u2019t know how\nmany      other     people\u201d    have    hair    microscopically\nindistinguishable from Butler\u2019s, and Scholberg repeatedly\nagreed that he had \u201cno idea.\u201d A.A. 90. This disputed testimony\nis actually helpful to Butler.\n\n      In fairness, I should note that the short redirect\nexamination raises two similar concerns, although the FBI did\nnot identify it as containing any false testimony. First,\nScholberg briefly repeated the point that he could almost never\nfail to distinguish the hair of a defendant from that of a victim.\nFor the reasons explained above, that statement is immaterial\nin this case, even if slightly misleading. Second, the prosecutor\nasked whether Scholberg was testifying that the crime-scene\nhair was \u201conly similar\u201d to Butler\u2019s. A.A. 89. Scholberg\nresponded: \u201cNo, I am not. When you imply that something is\nsimilar, you are implying that it is also different in some\nrespects. My report and my testimony is that these hairs are\nthe same. They are alike in all identifiable microscopic\ncharacteristics.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185191\"> <a href=\"/opinion/185191/united-states-v-ginyard-harry-a/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> In isolation, </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">this exchange might\nmisleadingly suggest that Scholberg could positively identify\nthe crime-scene hair as Butler\u2019s. But all Scholberg said was\nthat the hairs \u201care alike in all identifiable microscopic\ncharacteristics,\u201d and his direct examination explained at length\nwhy that did not and could not amount to a positive\nidentification. Moreover, defense counsel immediately cleared\n\f                              21\nup this point in the re-cross, where Scholberg twice\nacknowledged that he could not positively identify the crime-\nscene hairs as belonging to Butler\u2014or even estimate the\nprobability that they belonged to Butler.\n\n     Closing argument reveals much the same pattern: the hair\nevidence played a small role in the government\u2019s overall case,\nand any overstatements were at worst fleeting, marginally\nmisleading, and amply corrected. The government addressed\nhair evidence in barely more than one page of its 25-page\nclosing. Moreover, its discussion of that evidence was\ncarefully hedged. The government reminded the jury that\nScholberg \u201ccouldn\u2019t say whose hair it was,\u201d and it merely\nasked the jury to \u201cconsider\u201d the hair evidence rather than to\n\u201cfind [Butler] guilty on that evidence.\u201d S.A. 495\u201396.
