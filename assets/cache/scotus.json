MARCEL\n          FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 18\u20131086. Argued January 13, 2020\u2014Decided May 14, 2020\nPetitioners (collectively Lucky Brand) and respondent (Marcel) both use\n  the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of their marks on jeans and other apparel.\n  Marcel received a trademark registration for the phrase \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d\n  and Lucky Brand uses the registered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and\n  other marks with the word \u201cLucky.\u201d This has led to nearly 20 years of\n  litigation, proceeding in three rounds. The first round resulted in a\n  2003 settlement agreement in which Lucky Brand agreed to stop using\n  the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and Marcel agreed to release any claims re-\n  garding Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own trademarks. In the second round\n  (2005 Action), Lucky Brand sued Marcel and its licensee for violating\n  its trademarks. Marcel filed several counterclaims turning, as rele-\n  vant here, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d but\n  it did not claim that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own marks alone in-\n  fringed the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark. In both a motion to dismiss the coun-\n  terclaims and an answer to them, Lucky Brand argued that the coun-\n  terclaims were barred by the settlement agreement, but it did not\n  invoke that defense later in the proceedings. The court in the 2005\n  Action permanently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\n  Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark, and a jury found against Lucky Brand on\n  Marcel\u2019s remaining counterclaims. In the third round (2011 Action),\n  Marcel sued Lucky Brand for continuing to infringe the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d\n  mark, but it did not reprise its 2005 allegation about Lucky Brand\u2019s\n  use of the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. After protracted litigation, Lucky\n  Brand moved to dismiss, arguing\u2014for the first time since early in the\n  2005 Action\u2014that Marcel had released its claims in the settlement\n  agreement. Marcel countered that Lucky Brand could not invoke the\n  release defense because it could have pursued that defense in the 2005\n\f2                LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                  MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                            Syllabus\n\n    Action but did not. The District Court granted Lucky Brand\u2019s motion\n    to dismiss. The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding that\n    \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d prohibited Lucky Brand from raising an unliti-\n    gated defense that it should have raised earlier.\nHeld: Because Marcel\u2019s 2011 Action challenged different conduct\u2014and\n raised different claims\u2014from the 2005 Action, Marcel cannot preclude\n Lucky Brand from raising new defenses. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (a) This case asks whether so-called \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d is a valid\n application of res judicata: a term comprising the doctrine of issue pre-\n clusion, which precludes a party from relitigating an issue actually de-\n cided in a prior action and necessary to the judgment, and the doctrine\n of claim preclusion, which prevents parties from raising issues that\n could have been raised and decided in a prior action. Any preclusion\n of defenses must, at a minimum, satisfy the strictures of issue preclu-\n sion or claim preclusion. See, e.g., Davis v. Brown, 94 U. S. 423, 428.\n Here, issue preclusion does not apply, so the causes of action must\n share a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact[s]\u201d for claim preclusion to\n apply, Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a724, Comment b, p. 199.\n Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Because the two suits here involved different marks and differ-\n ent conduct occurring at different times, they did not share a \u201ccommon\n nucleus of operative facts.\u201d The 2005 claims depended on Lucky\n Brand\u2019s alleged use of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d But in the 2011 Action, Marcel\n alleged that the infringement was Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its other marks\n containing the word \u201cLucky,\u201d not any use of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d itself. The\n conduct in the 2011 Action also occurred after the conclusion of the\n 2005 Action. But claim preclusion generally \u201c \u2018does not bar claims that\n are predicated on events that postdate the filing of the initial com-\n plaint,\u2019 \u201d Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. ___, ___, be-\n cause events occurring after a plaintiff files suit often give rise to new\n \u201coperative facts\u201d creating a new claim to relief. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    (c) Marcel claims that treatises and this Court\u2019s cases support a ver-\n sion of \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d that extends to the facts of this case. But\n none of those authorities describe scenarios applicable here, and they\n are unlikely to stand for anything more than that traditional claim or\n issue preclusion principles may bar defenses raised in a subsequent\n suit\u2014principles that do not bar Lucky Brand\u2019s release defense here.\n Pp. 10\u201312.\n898 F. 3d 232, reversed and remanded.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\f                        Cite as: 590 U.

MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n                                  [May 14, 2020]\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case arises from protracted litigation between peti-\ntioners Lucky Brand Dungarees, Inc., and others (collec-\ntively Lucky Brand) and respondent Marcel Fashions\nGroup, Inc. (Marcel). In the latest lawsuit between the two,\nLucky Brand asserted a defense against Marcel that it had\nnot pressed fully in a preceding suit between the parties.\nThis Court is asked to determine whether Lucky Brand\u2019s\nfailure to litigate the defense in the earlier suit barred\nLucky Brand from invoking it in the later suit. Because the\nparties agree that, at a minimum, the preclusion of such a\ndefense in this context requires that the two suits share the\nsame claim to relief\u2014and because we find that the two suits\nhere did not\u2014Lucky Brand was not barred from raising its\ndefense in the later action.\n                             I\n  Marcel and Lucky Brand both sell jeans and other ap-\nparel. Both entities also use the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of\ntheir marks on clothing. In 1986, Marcel received a federal\ntrademark registration for \u201cGet Lucky\u201d; a few years later,\n\f2            LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin 1990, Lucky Brand began selling apparel using the reg-\nistered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and other marks that in-\nclude the word \u201cLucky.\u201d 779 F. 3d 102, 105 (CA2 2015).\n   Three categories of marks are at issue in this case: Mar-\ncel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark; Lucky Brand\u2019s \u201cLucky Brand\u201d\nmark; and various other marks owned by Lucky Brand that\ncontain the word \u201cLucky.\u201d These trademarks have led to\nnearly 20 years of litigation between the two companies,\nproceeding in three rounds.\n                             A\n  In 2001\u2014the first round\u2014Marcel sued Lucky Brand, al-\nleging that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d in\nadvertisements infringed Marcel\u2019s trademark. In 2003, the\nparties signed a settlement agreement. As part of the deal,\nLucky Brand agreed to stop using the phrase \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d\nApp. 191. In exchange, Marcel agreed to release any claims\nregarding Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own trademarks. Id., at\n191\u2013192.\n                             B\n   The ink was barely dry on the settlement agreement\nwhen, in 2005, the parties began a second round of litiga-\ntion (2005 Action). Lucky Brand filed suit, alleging that\nMarcel and its licensee violated its trademarks by copying\nits designs and logos in a new clothing line. As relevant\nhere, Marcel filed several counterclaims that all turned, in\nlarge part, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet\nLucky\u201d: One batch of allegations asserted that Lucky Brand\nhad continued to use Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark in viola-\ntion of the settlement agreement, while others alleged that\nLucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and \u201cLucky\nBrand\u201d together was \u201cconfusingly similar to\u201d\u2014and thus in-\nfringed\u2013\u2013Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

None of Marcel\u2019s counterclaims alleged\nthat Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own marks alone\u2014i.e., inde-\npendent of any alleged use of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d\u2014infringed Mar-\ncel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.\n   Lucky Brand moved to dismiss the counterclaims, alleg-\ning that they were barred by the release provision of the\nsettlement agreement. After the District Court denied the\nmotion without prejudice, Lucky Brand noted the release\ndefense once more in its answer to Marcel\u2019s counterclaims.\nBut as the 2005 Action proceeded, Lucky Brand never again\ninvoked the release defense.\n   The 2005 Action concluded in two phases. First, as a\nsanction for misconduct during discovery, the District\nCourt concluded that Lucky Brand violated the settlement\nagreement by continuing to use \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and perma-\nnently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\nMarcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

The case\nthen proceeded to trial. The jury found against Lucky\nBrand on Marcel\u2019s remaining counterclaims\u2014those that al-\nleged infringement from Lucky Brand\u2019s continued use of the\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d catchphrase alongside its own marks. See\nBrief for Respondent 52.\n                              C\n   In April 2011, the third round of litigation began: Marcel\nfiled an action against Lucky Brand (2011 Action), main-\ntaining that Lucky Brand continued to infringe Marcel\u2019s\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark and, in so doing, contravened the judg-\nment issued in the 2005 Action.\n   This complaint did not reprise Marcel\u2019s earlier allegation\n(in the 2005 Action) that Lucky Brand continued to use the\n\f4               LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                 MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. Marcel argued only that Lucky\nBrand\u2019s continued, post-2010 use of Lucky Brand\u2019s own\nmarks\u2014some of which used the word \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014infringed\nMarcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark in a manner that (according to\nMarcel) was previously found infringing.1 Marcel requested\nthat the District Court enjoin Lucky Brand from using any\nof Lucky Brand\u2019s marks containing the word \u201cLucky.\u201d\n   The District Court granted Lucky Brand summary judg-\nment, concluding that Marcel\u2019s claims in the 2011 Action\nwere essentially the same as its counterclaims in the 2005\nAction.\n   But the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disa-\ngreed. 779 F. 3d 102. The court concluded that Marcel\u2019s\nclaims in the 2011 Action were distinct from those it had\nasserted in the 2005 Action, because the claims at issue in\nthe 2005 Action were \u201cfor earlier infringements.\u201d Id., at\n110. As the court noted, \u201c[w]inning a judgment . . . does not\ndeprive the plaintiff of the right to sue\u201d for the defendant\u2019s\n\u201csubsequent similar violations.\u201d Id., at 107.\n   The Second Circuit further rejected Marcel\u2019s request to\nhold Lucky Brand in contempt for violating the injunction\nissued in the 2005 Action. The court noted that the conduct\nat issue in the 2011 Action was Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own\nmarks\u2014not the use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d By contrast,\nthe 2005 injunction prohibited Lucky Brand from using the\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark\u2014not Lucky Brand\u2019s own marks that hap-\npened to contain the word \u201cLucky.\u201d Id., at 111.

The court vacated and remanded for\nfurther proceedings.\n   On remand to the District Court, Lucky Brand moved to\ndismiss, arguing\u2014for the first time since its motion to dis-\nmiss and answer in the 2005 Action\u2014that Marcel had re-\nleased its claims by entering the settlement agreement.\nMarcel countered that Lucky Brand was precluded from in-\nvoking the release defense, because it could have pursued\nthe defense fully in the 2005 Action but had neglected to do\nso. The District Court granted Lucky Brand\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss, holding that it could assert its release defense and\nthat the settlement agreement indeed barred Marcel\u2019s\nclaims.\n   The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding\nthat a doctrine it termed \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d prohibited\nLucky Brand from raising the release defense in the 2011\nAction. 898 F. 3d 232 (2018). Noting that a different cate-\ngory of preclusion\u2014issue preclusion\u2014may be wielded\nagainst a defendant, see Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439\nU. S. 322 (1979), the court reasoned that the same should\nbe true of claim preclusion: A defendant should be pre-\ncluded from raising an unlitigated defense that it should\nhave raised earlier. The panel then held that \u201cdefense pre-\nclusion\u201d bars a party from raising a defense where: \u201c(i) a\nprevious action involved an adjudication on the merits\u201d; \u201c(ii)\nthe previous action involved the same parties\u201d; \u201c(iii) the de-\nfense was either asserted or could have been asserted, in\nthe prior action\u201d; and \u201c(iv) the district court, in its discre-\ntion, concludes that preclusion of the defense is appropri-\nate.\u201d 898 F. 3d, at 241. Finding each factor satisfied in this\ncase, the panel vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment. We\ngranted certiorari, 588 U.

Blue\nCross and Blue Shield of Alabama, 935 F. 2d 1187, 1192\n(CA11 1991).\n                               II\n                               A\n    This case asks whether so-called \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d is a\nvalid application of res judicata: a term that now comprises\ntwo distinct doctrines regarding the preclusive effect of\nprior litigation. 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure \u00a74402 (3d ed. 2016) (Wright &\nMiller). The first is issue preclusion (sometimes called col-\nlateral estoppel), which precludes a party from relitigating\nan issue actually decided in a prior case and necessary to\nthe judgment. Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 94 (1980);\nsee Parklane Hosiery, 439 U. S., at 326, n. 5.\n    The second doctrine is claim preclusion (sometimes itself\ncalled res judicata). Unlike issue preclusion, claim preclu-\nsion prevents parties from raising issues that could have\nbeen raised and decided in a prior action\u2014even if they were\nnot actually litigated. If a later suit advances the same\nclaim as an earlier suit between the same parties, the ear-\nlier suit\u2019s judgment \u201cprevents litigation of all grounds for,\nor defenses to, recovery that were previously available to\nthe parties, regardless of whether they were asserted or de-\ntermined in the prior proceeding.\u201d Brown v. Felsen, 442\nU. S. 127, 131 (1979); see also Wright & Miller \u00a74407. Suits\ninvolve the same claim (or \u201ccause of action\u201d) when they\n\u201c \u2018aris[e] from the same transaction,\u2019 \u201d United States v.\nTohono O\u2019odham Nation, 563 U. S. 307, 316 (2011) (quoting\nKremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 482, n. 22\n(1982)), or involve a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative facts,\u201d\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a724, Comment b, p. 199\n(1982) (Restatement (Second)).\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Put another way, claim preclusion \u201cdescribes the rules\nformerly known as \u2018merger\u2019 and \u2018bar.\u2019 \u201d Taylor v. Sturgell,\n553 U. S. 880, 892, n. 5 (2008). \u201cIf the plaintiff wins, the\nentire claim is merged in the judgment; the plaintiff cannot\nbring a second independent action for additional relief, and\nthe defendant cannot avoid the judgment by offering new\ndefenses.\u201d Wright & Miller \u00a74406. But \u201c[i]f the second law-\nsuit involves a new claim or cause of action, the parties may\nraise assertions or defenses that were omitted from the first\nlawsuit even though they were equally relevant to the first\ncause of action.\u201d Ibid.\n   As the Second Circuit itself seemed to recognize, see 898\nF. 3d, at 236\u2013237, this Court has never explicitly recognized\n\u201cdefense preclusion\u201d as a standalone category of res judi-\ncata, unmoored from the two guideposts of issue preclusion\nand claim preclusion. Instead, our case law indicates that\nany such preclusion of defenses must, at a minimum, sat-\nisfy the strictures of issue preclusion or claim preclusion.\nSee, e.g., Davis v. Brown, 94 U. S. 423, 428 (1877) (holding\nthat where two lawsuits involved different claims, preclu-\nsion operates \u201conly upon the matter actually at issue and\ndetermined in the original action\u201d).2 The parties thus agree\nthat where, as here, issue preclusion does not apply, a de-\nfense can be barred only if the \u201ccauses of action are the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 There may be good reasons to question any application of claim pre-\n\nclusion to defenses. It has been noted that in suits involving successive\nclaims against the same defendant, courts often \u201cassum[e] that the de-\nfendant may raise defenses in the second action that were not raised in\nthe first, even though they were equally available and relevant in both\nactions.\u201d Wright & Miller \u00a74414. This is because \u201c[v]arious considera-\ntions, other than actual merits, may govern\u201d whether to bring a defense,\n\u201csuch as the smallness of the amount or the value of the property in con-\ntroversy, the difficulty of obtaining the necessary evidence, the expense\nof the litigation, and [a party\u2019s] own situation.\u201d Cromwell v. County of\nSac, 94 U. S. 351, 356 (1877). Here, however, this Court need not deter-\nmine when (if ever) applying claim preclusion to defenses may be appro-\npriate, because a necessary predicate\u2014identity of claims\u2014is lacking.\n\f8            LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nsame\u201d in the two suits\u2014that is, where they share a \u201c \u2018com-\nmon nucleus of operative fact[s].\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 2,\n27, 31, 50; accord, Reply Brief 3.\n                                B\n   Put simply, the two suits here were grounded on different\nconduct, involving different marks, occurring at different\ntimes. They thus did not share a \u201ccommon nucleus of oper-\native facts.\u201d Restatement (Second) \u00a724, Comment b, at 199.\n   To start, claims to relief may be the same for the purposes\nof claim preclusion if, among other things, \u201c \u2018a different\njudgment in the second action would impair or destroy\nrights or interests established by the judgment entered in\nthe first action.\u2019 \u201d Wright & Miller \u00a74407. Here, however,\nthe 2011 Action did not imperil the judgment of the 2005\nAction because the lawsuits involved both different conduct\nand different trademarks.\n   In the 2005 Action, Marcel alleged that Lucky Brand in-\nfringed Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark both by directly imitat-\ning its \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark and by using the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d slo-\ngan alongside Lucky Brand\u2019s other marks in a way that\ncreated consumer confusion. Brief for Respondent 52. Mar-\ncel appears to admit, thus, that its claims in the 2005 Action\ndepended on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged use of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d Id.,\nat 9\u201310 (\u201cMarcel\u2019s reverse-confusion theory [in the 2005 Ac-\ntion] depended, in part, on Lucky\u2019s continued imitation of\nthe GET LUCKY mark\u201d).\n   By contrast, the 2011 Action did not involve any alleged\nuse of the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. Indeed, Lucky Brand had\nbeen enjoined in the 2005 Action from using \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d\nand in the 2011 Action, Lucky Brand was found not to have\nviolated that injunction. 779 F. 3d, at 111\u2013112. The parties\nthus do not argue that Lucky Brand continued to use \u201cGet\nLucky\u201d after the 2005 Action concluded, and at oral argu-\nment, counsel for Marcel appeared to confirm that Marcel\u2019s\nclaims in the 2011 Action did not allege that Lucky Brand\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontinued to use \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Instead,\nMarcel alleged in the 2011 Action that Lucky Brand com-\nmitted infringement by using Lucky Brand\u2019s own marks\ncontaining the word \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014not the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark it-\nself. Plainly, then, the 2011 Action challenged different\nconduct, involving different marks.\n   Not only that, but the complained-of conduct in the 2011\nAction occurred after the conclusion of the 2005 Action.\nClaim preclusion generally \u201cdoes not bar claims that are\npredicated on events that postdate the filing of the initial\ncomplaint.\u201d Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S.\n___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U. S.\n322, 327\u2013328 (1955) (holding that two suits were not \u201cbased\non the same cause of action,\u201d because \u201c[t]he conduct pres-\nently complained of was all subsequent to\u201d the prior judg-\nment and it \u201ccannot be given the effect of extinguishing\nclaims which did not even then exist and which could not\npossibly have been sued upon in the previous case\u201d). This\nis for good reason: Events that occur after the plaintiff files\nsuit often give rise to new \u201c[m]aterial operative facts\u201d that\n\u201cin themselves, or taken in conjunction with the antecedent\nfacts,\u201d create a new claim to relief. Restatement (Second)\n\u00a724, Comment f, at 203; 18 J. Moore, D. Coquillette, G. Jo-\nseph, G. Vairo, & C. Varner, Federal Practice \u00a7131.22[1], p.\n131\u201355, n. 1 (3d ed. 2019) (citing cases where \u201c[n]ew facts\ncreate[d a] new claim\u201d).\n   This principle takes on particular force in the trademark\ncontext, where the enforceability of a mark and likelihood\nof confusion between marks often turns on extrinsic facts\nthat change over time. As Lucky Brand points out, liability\nfor trademark infringement turns on marketplace realities\nthat can change dramatically from year to year. Brief for\nPetitioners 42\u201345. It is no surprise, then, that the Second\nCircuit held that Marcel\u2019s 2011 Action claims were not\nbarred by the 2005 Action. By the same token, the 2005\n\f10           LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nAction could not bar Lucky Brand\u2019s 2011 defenses.\n  At bottom, the 2011 Action involved different marks, dif-\nferent legal theories, and different conduct\u2014occurring at\ndifferent times. Because the two suits thus lacked a \u201ccom-\nmon nucleus of operative facts,\u201d claim preclusion did not\nand could not bar Lucky Brand from asserting its settle-\nment agreement defense in the 2011 Action.\n                             III\n   Resisting this conclusion, Marcel points to treatises and\nthis Court\u2019s cases, arguing that they support a version of\n\u201cdefense preclusion\u201d doctrine that extends to the facts of\nthis case. Brief for Respondent 24\u201326. But these authori-\nties do no such thing. As an initial matter, regardless of\nwhat those authorities might imply about \u201cdefense preclu-\nsion,\u201d none of them describe scenarios applicable here.\nMoreover, we doubt that these authorities stand for any-\nthing more than that traditional claim- or issue-preclusion\nprinciples may bar defenses raised in a subsequent suit\u2014\nprinciples that, as explained above, do not bar Lucky\nBrand\u2019s release defense here.\n   Take, for example, cases that involve either judgment en-\nforcement or a collateral attack on a prior judgment. Id., at\n26\u201335. In the former scenario, a party takes action to en-\nforce a prior judgment already issued against another; in\nthe latter, a party seeks to avoid the effect of a prior judg-\nment by bringing a suit to undo it. If, in either situation, a\ndifferent outcome in the second action \u201cwould nullify the in-\nitial judgment or would impair rights established in the in-\nitial action,\u201d preclusion principles would be at play. Re-\nstatement (Second) \u00a722(b), at 185; Wright & Miller \u00a74414.\nIn both scenarios, courts simply apply claim preclusion or\nissue preclusion to prohibit a claim or defense that would\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nattack a previously decided claim.3 But these principles do\nnot preclude defendants from asserting defenses to new\nclaims, which is precisely what Marcel would have us do\nhere.\n  In any event, judgment-enforcement and collateral-at-\ntack scenarios are far afield from the circumstances of this\ncase. Lucky Brand\u2019s defense in the 2011 Action did not\nthreaten the judgment issued in the 2005 Action or, as Mar-\ncel argues, \u201cachieve the same practical result\u201d that the\nabove-mentioned principles seek to avoid. Brief for Re-\nspondent 31\u201332. Indeed, while the judgment in the 2005\nAction plainly prohibited Lucky Brand from using \u201cGet\nLucky,\u201d it did not do the same with respect to Lucky Brand\u2019s\ncontinued, standalone use of its own marks containing the\nword \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014the only conduct at issue in the 2011 Action.\nPut simply, Lucky Brand\u2019s defense to new claims in the\n2011 Action did not risk impairing the 2005 judgment.\n  Nor do cases like Beloit v. Morgan, 7 Wall. 619 (1869), aid\nMarcel. See Brief for Respondent 32\u201333. To be sure, Beloit\nheld that a defendant in a second suit over bonds \u201cof the\nsame issue\u201d was precluded from raising a defense it had not\nraised in the first suit. 7 Wall., at 620. But the Court there\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 One might ask: If any preclusion of defenses (under the claim-preclu-\n\nsion rubric) requires identity of claims in two suits, how could the second\nsimilar suit have avoided standard claim preclusion in the first place?\nDifferent contexts may yield different answers. In a judgment-enforce-\nment context, the answer may be that claim preclusion applies only \u201cto\na final judgment rendered in an action separate from that in which the\ndoctrine is asserted.\u201d 18 J. Moore, D. Coquillette, G. Joseph, G. Vairo, &\nC. Varner, Federal Practice \u00a7131.31[1], p. 131\u2013116 (3d ed. 2019) (empha-\nsis added). Thus\u2014although claim preclusion does apply to a later,\nstandalone suit seeking relief that could have been obtained in the first\u2014\nit \u201cis not applicable to . . . efforts to obtain supplemental relief in the\noriginal action, or direct attacks on the judgment.\u201d Ibid (footnote de-\nleted). The upshot is that\u2014even if a court deems the underlying core of\noperative facts to be the same\u2014a plaintiff in that circumstance is not\nprecluded from enforcing its rights with respect to continuing wrongful\nconduct.\n\f12           LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained that the judgment in the first suit \u201cestablished\nconclusively the original validity of the securities described\nin the bill, and the liability of the town to pay them.\u201d Id.,\nat 623. In other words, by challenging the validity of all\nbonds of the same issue, the defense in the second suit\nwould have threatened the validity of the judgment in the\nfirst suit. The same cannot be said of the defense raised in\nthe 2011 Action vis-\u00e0-vis the judgment in the 2005 Action.\n                        *     *     *\n  At bottom, Marcel\u2019s 2011 Action challenged different con-\nduct\u2014and raised different claims\u2014from the 2005 Action.\nUnder those circumstances, Marcel cannot preclude Lucky\nBrand from raising new defenses. The judgment of the Sec-\nond Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                      5/19/2020 9:59:07 AM\n\n\n                                            Compare Results\n\n                             Old File:                                             New File:\n                           18-1086.pdf                                         18-1086_new.pdf\n                                                             versus\n                      14 pages (110 KB)                                        14 pages (109 KB)\n                     5/12/2020 3:21:46 PM                                     5/19/2020 9:58:14 AM\n\n\n\n\n                  Total Changes             Content                                Styling and\n                                                                                   Annotations\n                                            3\n                  3\n                                                Replacements\n                                                                                   0   Styling\n                                            0   Insertions\n                                                                                   0   Annotations\n                                            0   Deletions\n\n\n\n\n                                                Go to First Change (page 8)\n\n\n\n\nNoURLProvided.pdf[5/19/2020 9:59:07 AM]\n\f(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2019                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 13, 2020\u2014Decided May 14, 2020\nPetitioners (collectively Lucky Brand) and respondent (Marcel) both use\n  the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of their marks on jeans and other apparel.\n  Marcel received a trademark registration for the phrase \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d\n  and Lucky Brand uses the registered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and\n  other marks with the word \u201cLucky.\u201d This has led to nearly 20 years of\n  litigation, proceeding in three rounds. The first round resulted in a\n  2003 settlement agreement in which Lucky Brand agreed to stop using\n  the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and Marcel agreed to release any claims re-\n  garding Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own trademarks. In the second round\n  (2005 Action), Lucky Brand sued Marcel and its licensee for violating\n  its trademarks. Marcel filed several counterclaims turning, as rele-\n  vant here, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d but\n  it did not claim that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own marks alone in-\n  fringed the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark. In both a motion to dismiss the coun-\n  terclaims and an answer to them, Lucky Brand argued that the coun-\n  terclaims were barred by the settlement agreement, but it did not\n  invoke that defense later in the proceedings. The court in the 2005\n  Action permanently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\n  Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark, and a jury found against Lucky Brand on\n  Marcel\u2019s remaining counterclaims. In the third round (2011 Action),\n  Marcel sued Lucky Brand for continuing to infringe the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d\n  mark, but it did not reprise its 2005 allegation about Lucky Brand\u2019s\n  use of the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. After protracted litigation, Lucky\n  Brand moved to dismiss, arguing\u2014for the first time since early in the\n  2005 Action\u2014that Marcel had released its claims in the settlement\n  agreement. Marcel countered that Lucky Brand could not invoke the\n  release defense because it could have pursued that defense in the 2005\n\f2                LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                  MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                            Syllabus\n\n    Action but did not. The District Court granted Lucky Brand\u2019s motion\n    to dismiss. The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding that\n    \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d prohibited Lucky Brand from raising an unliti-\n    gated defense that it should have raised earlier.\nHeld: Because Marcel\u2019s 2011 Action challenged different conduct\u2014and\n raised different claims\u2014from the 2005 Action, Marcel cannot preclude\n Lucky Brand from raising new defenses. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (a) This case asks whether so-called \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d is a valid\n application of res judicata: a term comprising the doctrine of issue pre-\n clusion, which precludes a party from relitigating an issue actually de-\n cided in a prior action and necessary to the judgment, and the doctrine\n of claim preclusion, which prevents parties from raising issues that\n could have been raised and decided in a prior action. Any preclusion\n of defenses must, at a minimum, satisfy the strictures of issue preclu-\n sion or claim preclusion. See, e.g., Davis v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89486\"><a href=\"/opinion/89486/davis-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428.\n Here, issue preclusion does not apply, so the causes of action must\n share a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact[s]\u201d for claim preclusion to\n apply, Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a724, Comment b, p. 199.\n Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Because the two suits here involved different marks and differ-\n ent conduct occurring at different times, they did not share a \u201ccommon\n nucleus of operative facts.\u201d The 2005 claims depended on Lucky\n Brand\u2019s alleged use of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d But in the 2011 Action, Marcel\n alleged that the infringement was Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its other marks\n containing the word \u201cLucky,\u201d not any use of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d itself. The\n conduct in the 2011 Action also occurred after the conclusion of the\n 2005 Action.

(Marcel). In the latest lawsuit between the two,\nLucky Brand asserted a defense against Marcel that it had\nnot pressed fully in a preceding suit between the parties.\nThis Court is asked to determine whether Lucky Brand\u2019s\nfailure to litigate the defense in the earlier suit barred\nLucky Brand from invoking it in the later suit. Because the\nparties agree that, at a minimum, the preclusion of such a\ndefense in this context requires that the two suits share the\nsame claim to relief\u2014and because we find that the two suits\nhere did not\u2014Lucky Brand was not barred from raising its\ndefense in the later action.\n                             I\n  Marcel and Lucky Brand both sell jeans and other ap-\nparel. Both entities also use the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of\ntheir marks on clothing. In 1986, Marcel received a federal\ntrademark registration for \u201cGet Lucky\u201d; a few years later,\n\f2            LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin 1990, Lucky Brand began selling apparel using the reg-\nistered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and other marks that in-\nclude the word \u201cLucky.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (CA2 2015).\n   Three categories of marks are at issue in this case: Mar-\ncel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark; Lucky Brand\u2019s \u201cLucky Brand\u201d\nmark; and various other marks owned by Lucky Brand that\ncontain the word \u201cLucky.\u201d These trademarks have led to\nnearly 20 years of litigation between the two companies,\nproceeding in three rounds.\n                             A\n  In 2001\u2014the first round\u2014Marcel sued Lucky Brand, al-\nleging that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d in\nadvertisements infringed Marcel\u2019s trademark. In 2003, the\nparties signed a settlement agreement. As part of the deal,\nLucky Brand agreed to stop using the phrase \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d\nApp. 191.

Lucky Brand filed suit, alleging that\nMarcel and its licensee violated its trademarks by copying\nits designs and logos in a new clothing line. As relevant\nhere, Marcel filed several counterclaims that all turned, in\nlarge part, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet\nLucky\u201d: One batch of allegations asserted that Lucky Brand\nhad continued to use Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark in viola-\ntion of the settlement agreement, while others alleged that\nLucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and \u201cLucky\nBrand\u201d together was \u201cconfusingly similar to\u201d\u2014and thus in-\nfringed\u2013\u2013Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

After the District Court denied the\nmotion without prejudice, Lucky Brand noted the release\ndefense once more in its answer to Marcel\u2019s counterclaims.\nBut as the 2005 Action proceeded, Lucky Brand never again\ninvoked the release defense.\n   The 2005 Action concluded in two phases. First, as a\nsanction for misconduct during discovery, the District\nCourt concluded that Lucky Brand violated the settlement\nagreement by continuing to use \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and perma-\nnently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\nMarcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

See\nBrief for Respondent 52.\n                              C\n   In April 2011, the third round of litigation began: Marcel\nfiled an action against Lucky Brand (2011 Action), main-\ntaining that Lucky Brand continued to infringe Marcel\u2019s\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark and, in so doing, contravened the judg-\nment issued in the 2005 Action.\n   This complaint did not reprise Marcel\u2019s earlier allegation\n(in the 2005 Action) that Lucky Brand continued to use the\n\f4               LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                 MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase.

Indeed, while the judgment in the 2005\nAction plainly prohibited Lucky Brand from using \u201cGet\nLucky,\u201d it did not do the same with respect to Lucky Brand\u2019s\ncontinued, standalone use of its own marks containing the\nword \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014the only conduct at issue in the 2011 Action.\nPut simply, Lucky Brand\u2019s defense to new claims in the\n2011 Action did not risk impairing the 2005 judgment.\n  Nor do cases like Beloit v. Morgan, 7 Wall. 619 (1869), aid\nMarcel. See Brief for Respondent 32\u201333. To be sure, Beloit\nheld that a defendant in a second suit over bonds \u201cof the\nsame issue\u201d was precluded from raising a defense it had not\nraised in the first suit. 7 Wall., at 620. But the Court there\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 One might ask: If any preclusion of defenses (under the claim-preclu-\n\nsion rubric) requires identity of claims in two suits, how could the second\nsimilar suit have avoided standard claim preclusion in the first place?\nDifferent contexts may yield different answers. In a judgment-enforce-\nment context, the answer may be that claim preclusion applies only \u201cto\na final judgment rendered in an action separate from that in which the\ndoctrine is asserted.\u201d 18 J. Moore, D. Coquillette, G. Joseph, G. Vairo, &\nC. Varner, Federal Practice \u00a7131.31[1], p. 131\u2013116 (3d ed. 2019) (empha-\nsis added).

The upshot is that\u2014even if a court deems the underlying core of\noperative facts to be the same\u2014a plaintiff in that circumstance is not\nprecluded from enforcing its rights with respect to continuing wrongful\nconduct.\n\f12           LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained that the judgment in the first suit \u201cestablished\nconclusively the original validity of the securities described\nin the bill, and the liability of the town to pay them.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span>\nat 623. </span><pre class=\"inline\">In other words, by challenging the validity of all\nbonds of the same issue, the defense in the second suit\nwould have threatened the validity of the judgment in the\nfirst suit.

Decided May 14, 2020\n\n  The application to vacate stay presented to JUSTICE\nALITO and by him referred to the Court is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE\nGINSBURG joins, respecting the denial of application to va-\ncate stay.\n  In this lawsuit, inmates in a Texas geriatric prison allege\nthat their facility failed to protect them from the dangers of\nCovid\u201319. The District Court heard unrebutted testimony\nabout the imminent dangers faced by the inmates, some of\nwhom have already died. It also heard testimony about the\nfacility\u2019s lackluster efforts to keep the illness from spread-\ning and held that the facility\u2019s inexplicable failures\namounted to deliberate indifference for its elderly inmates\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment. On that basis, it\nissued an injunction requiring the prison to follow an exten-\nsive protocol, including frequent cleaning and increased ed-\nucation efforts. 2020 WL 1899274 (SD Tex., Apr. 16, 2020).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed that in-\njunction pending appeal, and the inmates now seek to va-\ncate that stay in this Court. 956 F. 3d 797 (2020) (per cu-\nriam).\n  Notably, where the Court is asked to undo a stay issued\nbelow, the bar is high. Among other things, applicants\nmust show that the lower court was \u201c \u2018demonstrably wrong\nin its application of accepted standards in deciding to issue\nthe stay.\u2019 \u201d Western Airlines, Inc. v.

The Fifth\nCircuit ruled, among other things, that the prison was\nsubstantially likely to succeed on its claim that the inmates\nfailed to exhaust their remedies as required by the Prison\nLitigation and Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71997e(a). Under the circumstances of this case, where\nthe inmates filed a lawsuit before filing any grievance with\nthe prison itself, it is hard to conclude that the Fifth Circuit\nwas demonstrably wrong on this preliminary procedural\nholding.\n   I write separately to highlight the disturbing allegations\npresented below. Further, where plaintiffs demonstrate\nthat a prison grievance system cannot or will not respond\nto an inmate\u2019s complaint, they could well satisfy an excep-\ntion to the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. Finally, while\nStates and prisons retain discretion in how they respond to\nhealth emergencies, federal courts do have an obligation to\nensure that prisons are not deliberately indifferent in the\nface of danger and death.\n                               I\n   The facility at issue (the Pack Unit) houses about 1,200\ninmates, more than 800 of whom are 65 or older. As the\nDistrict Court found, the risk of Covid\u201319 spreading in the\nPack Unit is particularly high. The facility is a dormitory-\nstyle prison, with each inmate separated only by a short,\ncubicle-style half-wall. When the District Court issued its\nruling, Covid\u201319 had already begun to spread in the facil-\nity. On April 11, 2020, one inmate, Leonard Clerkly, was\ntransferred to the hospital because of difficulty breathing,\na symptom the hospital linked to Covid\u201319. He was pro-\nnounced dead mere hours later.\n   Before and after Clerkly\u2019s death, prison administrators\nbegan implementing policies to control the spread of Covid\u2013\n19. For instance, the prison placed all inmates on a precau-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

It also established a policy of providing\ninmates with cloth masks to be changed daily and in-\nstructed inmates to request additional soap at no cost. But\nthe District Court found that the facility inexplicably failed\nto comply with some of its self-declared policies.\n    The District Court heard unrefuted testimony that, de-\nspite the prison\u2019s claim of enhanced cleaning measures, its\ncleaning protocol in practice remained virtually the same.\nThe facility neither increased the number of inmate janitors\nnor ensured that the existing janitors did their jobs safely\nand effectively.

Given the particular vulnerabilities of the inmates\nin the Pack Unit, even counsel for the prison admitted that steps beyond\nthose prescribed by the CDC may be necessary. Ibid. And, of course, the\nDistrict Court found that the prison was regularly failing to comply with\nstandards far below what the CDC suggests. Much of its injunction tar-\ngeted that behavior.\n\f6                  VALENTINE v.

Ibid. Here, of course, it is\ndifficult to tell whether the prison\u2019s system fits in that nar-\nrow category, as applicants did not attempt to avail them-\nselves of the grievance process before filing suit. But I cau-\ntion that in these unprecedented circumstances, where an\ninmate faces an imminent risk of harm that the grievance\nprocess cannot or does not answer, the PLRA\u2019s textual ex-\nception could open the courthouse doors where they would\notherwise stay closed.\n                              III\n   While I disagree with much of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis\nat this preliminary juncture, the court required reports\nevery 10 days on the status of the inmates in the prison\u2019s\ncare. I expect that it and other courts will be vigilant in\nprotecting the constitutional rights of those like applicants.\nAs the circumstances of this case make clear, the stakes\ncould not be higher. Just a few nights ago, respondents re-\nvealed that \u201cnumerous inmates and staff members\u201d at the\nPack Unit \u201care now COVID-19 positive and the vast major-\nity of those tested positive within the past two weeks.\u201d\nSupp. Brief Regarding Emergency Application 1.\n   Nothing in this Court\u2019s order, of course, prevents the\nFifth Circuit from amending its stay. Nor does anything in\nour order prevent applicants from seeking new relief in the\nDistrict Court, as appropriate, based on changed circum-\nstances. Finally, administrative convenience must be bal-\nanced against the risk of danger presented by emergency\nsituations. The prison, for example, has failed to explain\nwhy it could not simply decrease dorm density, despite hav-\ning an empty unit at its disposal.\n   It has long been said that a society\u2019s worth can be judged\nby taking stock of its prisons.

Under the circumstances of this case, where\nthe inmates filed a lawsuit before filing any grievance with\nthe prison itself, it is hard to conclude that the Fifth Circuit\nwas demonstrably wrong on this preliminary procedural\nholding.\n   I write separately to highlight the disturbing allegations\npresented below. Further, where plaintiffs demonstrate\nthat a prison grievance system cannot or will not respond\nto an inmate\u2019s complaint, they could well satisfy an excep-\ntion to the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. Finally, while\nStates and prisons retain discretion in how they respond to\nhealth emergencies, federal courts do have an obligation to\nensure that prisons are not deliberately indifferent in the\nface of danger and death.\n                               I\n   The facility at issue (the Pack Unit) houses about 1,200\ninmates, more than 800 of whom are 65 or older. As the\nDistrict Court found, the risk of Covid\u201319 spreading in the\nPack Unit is particularly high. The facility is a dormitory-\nstyle prison, with each inmate separated only by a short,\ncubicle-style half-wall. When the District Court issued its\nruling, Covid\u201319 had already begun to spread in the facil-\nity. On April 11, 2020, one inmate, Leonard Clerkly, was\ntransferred to the hospital because of difficulty breathing,\na symptom the hospital linked to Covid\u201319. He was pro-\nnounced dead mere hours later.\n   Before and after Clerkly\u2019s death, prison administrators\nbegan implementing policies to control the spread of Covid\u2013\n19. For instance, the prison placed all inmates on a precau-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

It also established a policy of providing\ninmates with cloth masks to be changed daily and in-\nstructed inmates to request additional soap at no cost. But\nthe District Court found that the facility inexplicably failed\nto comply with some of its self-declared policies.\n    The District Court heard unrefuted testimony that, de-\nspite the prison\u2019s claim of enhanced cleaning measures, its\ncleaning protocol in practice remained virtually the same.\nThe facility neither increased the number of inmate janitors\nnor ensured that the existing janitors did their jobs safely\nand effectively. One janitor testified that, just as before the\npandemic, the cleaning solution provided to the cleaning\ncrews was frequently depleted by midafternoon, only half-\nway through a shift. Each day he received only one pair of\ngloves to share with his co-janitor, an arrangement medical\nexperts described as tantamount to no gloves at all. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2020</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1916883</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5\u2013*6, *10 (SD Tex., Apr. 20, 2020).\n    The facility\u2019s failures to comply with its own safety proto-\ncol became even clearer after Clerkly\u2019s death.

Thus, when a\ngrievance procedure is a \u201cdead end\u201d\u2014when \u201cthe facts on the\nground\u201d indicate that the grievance procedure provides no\npossibility of relief\u2014the procedures may well be \u201cunavaila-\nble.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n   The Fifth Circuit seemed to reject the possibility that\ngrievance procedures could ever be a \u201cdead end\u201d even if they\ncould not provide relief before an inmate faced a serious risk\nof death. But if a plaintiff has established that the prison\ngrievance procedures at issue are utterly incapable of re-\nsponding to a rapidly spreading pandemic like Covid\u201319,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nand Prevention (CDC).

But I cau-\ntion that in these unprecedented circumstances, where an\ninmate faces an imminent risk of harm that the grievance\nprocess cannot or does not answer, the PLRA\u2019s textual ex-\nception could open the courthouse doors where they would\notherwise stay closed.\n                              III\n   While I disagree with much of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis\nat this preliminary juncture, the court required reports\nevery 10 days on the status of the inmates in the prison\u2019s\ncare. I expect that it and other courts will be vigilant in\nprotecting the constitutional rights of those like applicants.\nAs the circumstances of this case make clear, the stakes\ncould not be higher. Just a few nights ago, respondents re-\nvealed that \u201cnumerous inmates and staff members\u201d at the\nPack Unit \u201care now COVID-19 positive and the vast major-\nity of those tested positive within the past two weeks.\u201d\nSupp. Brief Regarding Emergency Application 1.\n   Nothing in this Court\u2019s order, of course, prevents the\nFifth Circuit from amending its stay. Nor does anything in\nour order prevent applicants from seeking new relief in the\nDistrict Court, as appropriate, based on changed circum-\nstances. Finally, administrative convenience must be bal-\nanced against the risk of danger presented by emergency\nsituations. The prison, for example, has failed to explain\nwhy it could not simply decrease dorm density, despite hav-\ning an empty unit at its disposal.\n   It has long been said that a society\u2019s worth can be judged\nby taking stock of its prisons. That is all the truer in this\npandemic, where inmates everywhere have been rendered\n\f                Cite as: 590 U.

KAREEM GARRETT\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n               No. 19\u2013867.   Decided May 18, 2020\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n   Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA),\nprisoners must exhaust administrative remedies before\nchallenging prison conditions in federal court. 110 Stat.\n321\u201371, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a). This case presents the ques-\ntion whether a prisoner who fails to comply with that ex-\nhaustion requirement may cure the defect by filing an\namended or supplemental complaint after his release. Be-\ncause the Circuits are divided on this important question of\nfederal law, I would grant the petition for certiorari.\n   While incarcerated, respondent brought this pro se action\nagainst prison medical personnel under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983,\nbut he did not complete the prison\u2019s grievance process be-\nfore filing suit. After he was released, respondent filed an\namended and supplemental complaint. The District Court\ndismissed respondent\u2019s claims against petitioners for fail-\nure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the\nPLRA.\n   The Third Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment,\nconcluding that the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement no\nlonger applied to respondent\u2019s claims in light of his postre-\nlease filing. 938 F. 3d 69 (2019). The court rejected peti-\ntioners\u2019 argument that the plain language of the statute,\nwhich speaks to when an \u201caction [may] be brought,\u201d re-\nquires courts to assess PLRA compliance at the time of the\ninitial filing. \u00a71997e(a). Noting that our decision in Jones\nv. Bock, 549 U. S. 199 (2007), characterized this language\n\f2                 WEXFORD HEALTH v. GARRETT\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nas \u201cboilerplate,\u201d id., at 220, the court determined that the\nstatute\u2019s text did not clearly displace normal procedural\nrules. The court further concluded that, under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 15, the amended and supplemental com-\nplaint related back to respondent\u2019s initial filing and there-\nfore superseded the original complaint. Because respond-\nent was no longer a prisoner when he amended and\nsupplemented his complaint, the court reasoned that he\nwas no longer subject to the PLRA\u2019s prefiling requirements.\n   The Third Circuit noted that its holding was consistent\nwith the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach in Jackson v. Fong, 870\nF. 3d 928 (2017), but conflicted with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\nen banc decision in Harris v. Garner, 216 F. 3d 970 (2000).\nIn Harris, the Eleventh Circuit interpreted the same statu-\ntory language in a related PLRA requirement and held that\nprisoners could not cure their initial filing defects by\namending or supplementing their complaints after release.\nId., at 981\u2013982; see also Smith v. Terry, 491 Fed. Appx. 81,\n83 (CA11 2012) (applying Harris to the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion\nrequirement). The Third Circuit\u2019s position also conflicts\nwith that of the Fifth Circuit, which has recently explained\nthat a complaint must be dismissed and refiled postrelease\nin order for a prisoner to avoid the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion re-\nquirement. Bargher v. White, 928 F. 3d 439, 447\u2013448\n(2019). Thus, four Courts of Appeals are evenly divided on\nthe question presented.*\n   Respondent suggests that the Fifth and Eleventh Cir-\ncuits may revisit their view in light of our decision in Jones.\nAs an initial matter, both Circuits have affirmed their posi-\ntions in decisions that postdate Jones. See Bargher, 928\nF. 3d 439; Smith, 491 Fed Appx. 81. But more importantly,\nrespondent reads our \u201cboilerplate\u201d dicta for far more than\nit is worth. In Jones, we rejected court-made pleading rules\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * A panel of the Sixth Circuit has also agreed with the Eleventh Circuit\nin dicta. See Cox v. Mayer, 332 F. 3d 422, 428 (2003).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor pro se litigants, explaining that \u201cthe PLRA\u2019s screening\nrequirement does not\u2014explicitly or implicitly\u2014justify devi-\nating from the usual procedural practice beyond the depar-\ntures specified by the PLRA itself.\u201d 549 U. S., at 214 (em-\nphasis added). Thus, that decision actually confirms that\nthe PLRA\u2019s prefiling requirements displace the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 15. We character-\nized the phrase \u201c \u2018no action shall be brought\u2019 \u201d as \u201cboiler-\nplate\u201d solely for the purpose of explaining that the PLRA\nspeaks to the dismissal of defective claims, not necessarily\nentire complaints. Id., at 220. We have never addressed\nthe meaning of that language as applied to the context at\nissue here.\n   Finally, this question warrants our review because its\nresolution will have significant ramifications for not only\nprisoners and prison officials but also federal courts. In re-\ncent years, nearly 10,000 lawsuits have been filed annually\nby prisoners challenging prison conditions. See Adminis-\ntrative Office of the United States Courts, Federal Judicial\nCaseload Statistics, U. S. District Courts\u2014Civil Cases\nCommenced, by Basis of Jurisdiction and Nature of Suit\n(2019) (Table C\u20132). And nearly twice as many lawsuits are\nfiled annually raising other civil rights claims, ibid., which\nare subject to similarly worded prefiling requirements un-\nder the PLRA, see, e.g., \u00a71997e(e). Recognizing the PLRA\u2019s\nimportant role in curtailing the proliferation of abusive\nprisoner litigation, we have repeatedly rejected lower\ncourts\u2019 attempts to create end-runs around the statute\u2019s ex-\nhaustion requirement. See, e.g., Ross v. Blake, 578 U. S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2016) (slip op., at 5\u20138); Woodford v. Ngo, 548\nU. S. 81, 91, n. 2 (2006); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 520\n(2002); Booth v. Churner, 532 U. S. 731, 741, n. 6 (2001).\nThe same may be warranted here.\n   Because this petition presents an important question\nthat has divided the Circuits, it deserves our review. See\nthis Court\u2019s Rule 10(a). I see no reason to continue allowing\n\f4              WEXFORD HEALTH v.

REPUBLIC\n                  OF SUDAN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 17\u20131268. Argued February 24, 2020\u2014Decided May 18, 2020\nIn 1998, al Qaeda operatives detonated truck bombs outside the United\n  States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Victims and their family\n  members sued the Republic of Sudan under the state-sponsored ter-\n  rorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), for-\n  merly 28 U. S. C. \u00a71605(a)(7), alleging that Sudan had assisted al\n  Qaeda in perpetrating the attacks. At the time, the plaintiffs faced\n  \u00a71606\u2019s bar on punitive damages for suits proceeding under any of the\n  \u00a71605 sovereign immunity exceptions. In 2008, Congress amended the\n  FSIA in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). 122 Stat. 3.\n  In NDAA \u00a71083(a), Congress moved \u00a71605(a)(7) to a new section and\n  created an express federal cause of action for acts of terror that also\n  provided for punitive damages. See \u00a71605A(c). In \u00a71083(c)(2), it gave\n  effect to existing lawsuits that had been \u201cadversely affected\u201d by prior\n  law \u201cas if\u201d they had been originally filed under the new \u00a71605A(c). And\n  in \u00a71083(c)(3), it provided a time-limited opportunity for plaintiffs to\n  file new actions \u201carising out of the same act or incident\u201d as an earlier\n  action and claim \u00a71605A\u2019s benefits. Following these amendments, the\n  original plaintiffs amended their complaint to include the new federal\n  cause of action under \u00a71605A(c), and hundreds of others filed new, sim-\n  ilar claims. The district court entered judgment for the plaintiffs and\n  awarded approximately $10.2 billion in damages, including roughly\n  $4.3 billion in punitive damages. As relevant here, the court of appeals\n  held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to punitive damages because\n  Congress had included no statement in NDAA \u00a71083 clearly authoriz-\n  ing punitive damages for preenactment conduct.\n\f2                  OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: Plaintiffs in a federal cause of action under \u00a71605A(c) may seek\n punitive damages for preenactment conduct. Even assuming (without\n granting) that Sudan may claim the benefit of the presumption of pro-\n spectivity\u2014the assumption that Congress means its legislation to\n apply only to future conduct, see Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511\n U. S. 244\u2014Congress was as clear as it could have been when it ex-\n pressly authorized punitive damages under \u00a71605A(c) and explicitly\n made that new cause of action available to remedy certain past acts of\n terrorism.\n    Sudan stresses that \u00a71083(c) does not itself contain an express au-\n thorization of punitive damages. It does admit that \u00a71083(c) author-\n izes plaintiffs to bring \u00a71605A(c) claims for preenactment conduct.\n And it does concede that \u00a71605A(c) allows for damages that \u201cmay in-\n clude economic damages, solatium, [and] pain and suffering\u201d for preen-\n actment conduct. That list in the statute also \u201cinclude[s] . . . punitive\n damages,\u201d and no plausible account of \u00a71083(c) could be clear enough\n to authorize the retroactive application of all other \u00a71605A(c) features\n except punitive damages. Sudan also contends that \u00a71605A(c)\u2019s word-\n ing \u201cmay include . . . punitive damages\u201d fails the clarity test. But \u201c \u2018the\n word \u201cmay\u201d clearly connotes discretion,\u2019 \u201d Halo Electronics, Inc. v.\n Pulse Electronics, Inc., 579 U. S. ___, ___, and simply vests district\n courts with discretion to determine whether punitive damages are ap-\n propriate. In addition, all of the categories of special damages men-\n tioned in \u00a71605A(c) are provided on equal terms. Finally, Sudan sug-\n gests that a super-clarity rule should apply here because retroactive\n punitive damages raise special constitutional concerns. Such an inter-\n pretative rule is not reasonably administrable.\n    This Court declines to resolve other matters raised by the parties\n outside the question presented. But having decided that punitive dam-\n ages are permissible for federal claims and that the reasons the court\n of appeals offered for its contrary decision were mistaken, it follows\n that the court of appeals must also reconsider its decision concerning\n the availability of punitive damages for claims proceeding under state\n law.

Hundreds died, thousands were injured. In\ntime, victims and their family members sued the Republic\nof Sudan in federal court, alleging that it had assisted al\nQaeda in perpetrating the attacks. After more than a dec-\nade of motions practice, intervening legislative amend-\nments, and a trial, the plaintiffs proved Sudan\u2019s role in the\nattacks and established their entitlement to compensatory\nand punitive damages. On appeal, however, Sudan argued,\nand the court agreed, that the Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\nties Act barred the punitive damages award. It is that de-\ncision we now review and, ultimately, vacate.\n                             *\n  The starting point for nearly any dispute touching on for-\neign sovereign immunity lies in Schooner Exchange v.\nMcFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812). There, Chief Justice Mar-\n\f2               OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nshall explained that foreign sovereigns do not enjoy an in-\nherent right to be held immune from suit in American\ncourts: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the nation within its own terri-\ntory is necessarily exclusive and absolute. It is susceptible\nof no limitation not imposed by itself.\u201d Id., at 136. Still,\nChief Justice Marshall continued, many countries had de-\nclined to exercise jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns in\ncases involving foreign ministers and militaries. Id., at\n137\u2013140. And, accepting a suggestion from the Executive\nBranch, the Court agreed as a matter of comity to extend\nthat same immunity to a foreign sovereign in the case at\nhand. Id., at 134, 145\u2013147.\n   For much of our history, claims of foreign sovereign im-\nmunity were handled on a piecework basis that roughly\nparalleled the process in Schooner Exchange. Typically, af-\nter a plaintiff sought to sue a foreign sovereign in an Amer-\nican court, the Executive Branch, acting through the State\nDepartment, filed a \u201csuggestion of immunity\u201d\u2014case-spe-\ncific guidance about the foreign sovereign\u2019s entitlement to\nimmunity. See Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,\n461 U. S. 480, 487 (1983). Because foreign sovereign im-\nmunity is a matter of \u201cgrace and comity,\u201d Republic of Aus-\ntria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 689 (2004), and so often im-\nplicates judgments the Constitution reserves to the political\nbranches, courts \u201cconsistently . . . deferred\u201d to these sugges-\ntions. Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486.\n   Eventually, though, this arrangement began to break\ndown. In the mid-20th century, the State Department\nstarted to take a more restrictive and nuanced approach to\nforeign sovereign immunity. See id., at 486\u2013487. Some-\ntimes, too, foreign sovereigns neglected to ask the State De-\npartment to weigh in, leaving courts to make immunity de-\ncisions on their own.         See id., at 487\u2013488.         \u201cNot\nsurprisingly\u201d given these developments, \u201cthe governing\nstandards\u201d for foreign sovereign immunity determinations\nover time became \u201cneither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d Id.,\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 488.\n   In 1976, Congress sought to remedy the problem and ad-\ndress foreign sovereign immunity on a more comprehensive\nbasis. The result was the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct (FSIA). As a baseline rule, the FSIA holds foreign\nstates and their instrumentalities immune from the juris-\ndiction of federal and state courts. See 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71603(a), 1604. But the law also includes a number of ex-\nceptions. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71605, 1607. Of particular relevance\ntoday is the terrorism exception Congress added to the law\nin 1996. That exception permits certain plaintiffs to bring\nsuits against countries who have committed or supported\nspecified acts of terrorism and who are designated by the\nState Department as state sponsors of terror. Still, as orig-\ninally enacted, the exception shielded even these countries\nfrom the possibility of punitive damages. See Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (codifying state-\nsponsored terrorism exception at 28 U. S. C. \u00a71605(a)(7));\n\u00a71606 (generally barring punitive damages in suits pro-\nceeding under any of \u00a71605\u2019s sovereign immunity excep-\ntions).\n   Two years after Congress amended the FSIA, al Qaeda\nattacked the U. S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In\nresponse, a group of victims and affected family members\nled by James Owens sued Sudan in federal district court,\ninvoking the newly adopted terrorism exception and alleg-\ning that Sudan had provided shelter and other material\nsupport to al Qaeda. As the suit progressed, however, a\nquestion emerged. In its recent amendments, had Congress\nmerely withdrawn immunity for state-sponsored terrorism,\nallowing plaintiffs to proceed using whatever pre-existing\ncauses of action might be available to them? Or had Con-\ngress gone further and created a new federal cause of action\nto address terrorism? Eventually, the D. C. Circuit held\nthat Congress had only withdrawn immunity without cre-\nating a new cause of action. See Cicippio-Puelo v. Islamic\n\f4               OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRepublic of Iran, 353 F. 3d 1024, 1033 (2004).\n   In response to that and similar decisions, Congress\namended the FSIA again in the National Defense Authori-\nzation Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), 122 Stat. 338. Four\nchanges, all found in a single section, bear mention here.\nFirst, in \u00a71083(a) of the NDAA, Congress moved the state-\nsponsored terrorism exception from its original home in\n\u00a71605(a)(7) to a new section of the U. S. Code, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71605A. This had the effect of freeing claims brought under\nthe terrorism exception from the FSIA\u2019s usual bar on puni-\ntive damages. See \u00a71606 (denying punitive damages in\nsuits proceeding under a sovereign immunity exception\nfound in \u00a71605 but not \u00a71605A). Second, also in \u00a71083(a),\nCongress created an express federal cause of action for acts\nof terror. This new cause of action, codified at 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71605A(c), is open to plaintiffs who are U. S. nationals,\nmembers of the Armed Forces, U. S. government employees\nor contractors, and their legal representatives, and it ex-\npressly authorizes punitive damages. Third, in \u00a71083(c)(2)\nof the NDAA, a provision titled \u201cPrior Actions,\u201d Congress\naddressed existing lawsuits that had been \u201cadversely af-\nfected on the groun[d] that\u201d prior law \u201cfail[ed] to create a\ncause of action against the state.\u201d Actions like these, Con-\ngress instructed, were to be given effect \u201cas if \u201d they had\nbeen originally filed under \u00a71605A(c)\u2019s new federal cause of\naction. Finally, in \u00a71083(c)(3) of the NDAA, a provision ti-\ntled \u201cRelated Actions,\u201d Congress provided a time-limited\nopportunity for plaintiffs to file new actions \u201carising out of\nthe same act or incident\u201d as an earlier action and claim the\nbenefits of 28 U. S. C. \u00a71605A.\n   Following these amendments, the Owens plaintiffs\namended their complaint to include the new federal cause\nof action, and hundreds of additional victims and family\nmembers filed new claims against Sudan similar to those in\nOwens. Some of these new plaintiffs were U. S. nationals\nor federal government employees or contractors who sought\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrelief under the new \u00a71605A(c) federal cause of action. But\nothers were the foreign-national family members of U. S.\ngovernment employees or contractors killed or injured in\nthe attacks. Ineligible to invoke \u00a71605A(c)\u2019s new federal\ncause of action, these plaintiffs relied on \u00a71605A(a)\u2019s state-\nsponsored terrorism exception to overcome Sudan\u2019s sover-\neign immunity and then advance claims sounding in state\nlaw.\n   After a consolidated bench trial in which Sudan declined\nto participate, the district court entered judgment in favor\nof the plaintiffs. District Judge John Bates offered detailed\nfactual findings explaining that Sudan had knowingly\nserved as a safe haven near the two United States Embas-\nsies and allowed al Qaeda to plan and train for the attacks.\nThe court also found that Sudan had provided hundreds of\nSudanese passports to al Qaeda, allowed al Qaeda opera-\ntives to travel over the Sudan-Kenya border without re-\nstriction, and permitted the passage of weapons and money\nto supply al Qaeda\u2019s cell in Kenya. See Owens v. Republic\nof Sudan, 826 F. Supp. 2d 128, 139\u2013146 (DC 2011).\n   The question then turned to damages. Given the exten-\nsive and varied nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, the court\nappointed seven Special Masters to aid its factfinding.\nOver more than two years, the Special Masters conducted\nindividual damages assessments and submitted written re-\nports. Based on these reports, and after adding a substan-\ntial amount of prejudgment interest to account for the many\nyears of delay, the district court awarded a total of approx-\nimately $10.2 billion in damages, including roughly $4.3\nbillion in punitive damages to plaintiffs who had brought\nsuit in the wake of the 2008 amendments.\n   At that point, Sudan decided to appear and appeal.\nAmong other things, Sudan sought to undo the district\ncourt\u2019s punitive damages award. Generally, Sudan argued,\nCongress may create new forms of liability for past conduct\nonly by clearly stating its intention to do so. And, Sudan\n\f6               OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontinued, when Congress passed the NDAA in 2008, it no-\nwhere clearly authorized punitive damages for anything\ncountries like Sudan might have done in the 1990s.\n   The court of appeals agreed. It started by addressing the\nplaintiffs who had proceeded under the new federal cause\nof action in \u00a71605A(c). The court noted that, in passing the\nNDAA, Congress clearly authorized individuals to use the\nPrior Actions and Related Actions provisions to bring new\nfederal claims attacking past conduct. Likewise, the law\nclearly allowed these plaintiffs to collect compensatory\ndamages for their claims. But, the court held, Congress in-\ncluded no statement clearly authorizing punitive damages\nfor preenactment conduct. See Owens v. Republic of Sudan,\n864 F. 3d 751, 814\u2013817 (CADC 2017). Separately but for\nessentially the same reasons, the court held that the for-\neign-national family member plaintiffs who had proceeded\nunder state-law causes of action were also barred from\nseeking and obtaining punitive damages. Id., at 817.\n   The petitioners responded by asking this Court to review\nthe first of these rulings and decide whether the 2008\nNDAA amendments permit plaintiffs proceeding under the\nfederal cause of action in \u00a71605A(c) to seek and win puni-\ntive damages for past conduct. We agreed to resolve that\nquestion. 588 U.

See id., at 266\u2013267. No\ndoubt, reasons like these are exactly why the Constitution\ndiscourages retroactive lawmaking in so many ways, from\nits provisions prohibiting ex post facto laws, bills of attain-\nder, and laws impairing the obligations of contracts, to its\ndemand that any taking of property be accompanied by just\ncompensation. See id., at 266.\n   Still, Sudan doesn\u2019t challenge the constitutionality of the\n2008 NDAA amendments on these or any other grounds\u2014\nthe arguments we confront today are limited to the field of\nstatutory interpretation. But, as both sides acknowledge,\nthe principle of legislative prospectivity plays an important\nrole here too. In fact, the parties devote much of their brief-\ning to debating exactly how that principle should inform our\ninterpretation of the NDAA.\n   For its part, Sudan points to Landgraf. There, the Court\nobserved that, \u201cin decisions spanning two centuries,\u201d we\nhave approached debates about statutory meaning with an\nassumption that Congress means its legislation to respect\nthe principle of prospectivity and apply only to future con-\nduct\u2014and that, if and when Congress wishes to test its\npower to legislate retrospectively, it must say so \u201cclear[ly].\u201d\nId., at 272. All this is important, Sudan tells us, because\nwhen we look to the NDAA we will find no clear statement\nallowing courts to award punitive damages for past con-\nduct.\n   But if Sudan focuses on the rule, the petitioners highlight\nan exception suggested by Altmann. Because foreign sov-\nereign immunity is a gesture of grace and comity, Altmann\nreasoned, it is also something that may be withdrawn ret-\nroactively without the same risk to due process and equal\nprotection principles that other forms of backward-looking\nlegislation can pose. Foreign sovereign immunity\u2019s \u201cprinci-\npal purpose,\u201d after all, \u201chas never been to permit foreign\n\f8               OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstates . . . to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise\nof future immunity from suit in United States courts.\u201d 541\nU. S., at 696. Thus, Altmann held, \u201c[i]n th[e] sui generis\ncontext [of foreign sovereign immunity], . . . it [is] more ap-\npropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most re-\ncent decision [of the political branches] than to presume\nthat decision inapplicable merely because it postdates the\nconduct in question.\u201d Ibid. And, the petitioners stress, once\nthe presumption of prospectivity is swept away, the NDAA\nis easily read to authorize punitive damages for completed\nconduct.\n   Really, this summary only begins to scratch the surface\nof the parties\u2019 debate. Sudan replies that it may be one\nthing to retract immunity retroactively consistent with Alt-\nmann, because all that does is open a forum to hear an oth-\nerwise available legal claim. But it is another thing entirely\nto create new rules regulating primary conduct and impose\nthem retroactively. When Congress wishes to do that, Su-\ndan says, it must speak just as clearly as Landgraf com-\nmanded. And, Sudan adds, the NDAA didn\u2019t simply open a\nnew forum to hear a pre-existing claim; it also created a new\ncause of action governing completed conduct that the peti-\ntioners now seek to exploit. Cf. Altmann, 541 U. S., at 702\u2013\n704 (Scalia, J., concurring). In turn, the petitioners retort\nthat Altmann itself might have concerned whether a new\nforum could hear an otherwise available and pre-existing\nclaim, but its reasoning went further. According to the pe-\ntitioners, the decision also strongly suggested that the pre-\nsumption of prospectivity does not apply at all when it\ncomes to suits against foreign sovereigns, full stop. These\npoints and more the parties develop through much of their\nbriefing before us.\n   As we see it, however, there is no need to resolve the par-\nties\u2019 debate over interpretive presumptions. Even if we as-\nsume (without granting) that Sudan may claim the benefit\nof Landgraf \u2019s presumption of prospectivity, Congress was\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nas clear as it could have been when it authorized plaintiffs\nto seek and win punitive damages for past conduct using\n\u00a71065A(c)\u2019s new federal cause of action. After all, in\n\u00a71083(a), Congress created a federal cause of action that ex-\npressly allows suits for damages that \u201cmay include eco-\nnomic damages, solatium, pain and suffering, and punitive\ndamages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This new cause of action was\nhoused in a new provision of the U. S. Code, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71605A, to which the FSIA\u2019s usual prohibition on punitive\ndamages does not apply. See \u00a71606. Then, in \u00a7\u00a71083(c)(2)\nand (c)(3) of the very same statute, Congress allowed cer-\ntain plaintiffs in \u201cPrior Actions\u201d and \u201cRelated Actions\u201d to\ninvoke the new federal cause of action in \u00a71605A. Both pro-\nvisions specifically authorized new claims for preenactment\nconduct. Put another way, Congress proceeded in two\nequally evident steps: (1) It expressly authorized punitive\ndamages under a new cause of action; and (2) it explicitly\nmade that new cause of action available to remedy certain\npast acts of terrorism. Neither step presents any ambigu-\nity, nor is the NDAA fairly susceptible to any competing in-\nterpretation.\n   Sudan\u2019s primary rejoinder only serves to underscore the\nconclusion. Like the court of appeals before it, Sudan\nstresses that \u00a71083(c) itself contains no express authoriza-\ntion of punitive damages. But it\u2019s hard to see what differ-\nence that makes. Sudan admits that \u00a71083(c) authorizes\nplaintiffs to bring claims under \u00a71605A(c) for acts commit-\nted before the 2008 amendments. Sudan concedes, too, that\n\u00a71605A(c) authorizes plaintiffs to seek and win \u201ceconomic\ndamages, solatium, [and] pain and suffering,\u201d for preenact-\nment conduct. In fact, except for the two words \u201cpunitive\ndamages,\u201d Sudan accepts that every other jot and tittle of\n\u00a71605A(c) applies to actions properly brought under\n\u00a71083(c) for past conduct. And we can see no plausible ac-\ncount on which \u00a71083(c) could be clear enough to authorize\nthe retroactive application of all other features of\n\f10              OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71605A(c), just not these two words.\n   Sudan next contends that \u00a71605A(c) fails to authorize ret-\nroactive punitive damages with sufficient clarity because it\nsounds equivocal\u2014the provision says only that awards\n\u201cmay\u201d include punitive damages. But this language simply\nvests district courts with discretion to determine whether\npunitive damages are appropriate in view of the facts of a\nparticular case. As we have repeatedly observed when dis-\ncussing remedial provisions using similar language, \u201cthe\n\u2018word \u201cmay\u201d clearly connotes discretion.\u2019 \u201d Halo Electronics,\nInc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip\nop., at 8) (quoting Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546\nU. S. 132, 136 (2005), in turn quoting Fogerty v. Fantasy,\nInc., 510 U. S. 517, 533 (1994); emphasis added). What\u2019s\nmore, all of the categories of special damages mentioned in\n\u00a71605A(c) are provided on equal terms: \u201c[D]amages may\ninclude economic damages, solatium, pain and suffering,\nand punitive damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Sudan admits\nthat the statute vests the district court with discretion to\naward the first three kinds of damages for preenactment\nconduct\u2014and the same can be no less true when it comes to\nthe fourth.\n   That takes us to Sudan\u2019s final argument. Maybe Con-\ngress did act clearly when it authorized a new cause of ac-\ntion and other forms of damages for past conduct. But be-\ncause retroactive damages of the punitive variety raise\nspecial constitutional concerns, Sudan says, we should cre-\nate and apply a new rule requiring Congress to provide a\nsuper-clear statement when it wishes to authorize their\nuse.\n   We decline this invitation. It\u2019s true that punitive dam-\nages aren\u2019t merely a form a compensation but a form of pun-\nishment, and we don\u2019t doubt that applying new punish-\nments to completed conduct can raise serious constitutional\nquestions. See Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 281. But if Congress\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclearly authorizes retroactive punitive damages in a man-\nner a litigant thinks unconstitutional, the better course is\nfor the litigant to challenge the law\u2019s constitutionality, not\nask a court to ignore the law\u2019s manifest direction. Besides,\nwhen we fashion interpretive rules, we usually try to en-\nsure that they are reasonably administrable, comport with\nlinguistic usage and expectations, and supply a stable back-\ndrop against which Congress, lower courts, and litigants\nmay plan and act. See id., at 272\u2013273. And Sudan\u2019s pro-\nposal promises more nearly the opposite: How much\nclearer-than-clear should we require Congress to be when\nauthorizing the retroactive use of punitive damages? Su-\ndan doesn\u2019t even try to say, except to assure us it knows a\nsuper-clear statement when it sees it, and can\u2019t seem to find\none here. That sounds much less like an administrable rule\nof law than an appeal to the eye of the beholder.\n                               *\n   With the question presented now resolved, both sides ask\nus to tackle other matters in this long-running litigation.\nPerhaps most significantly, the petitioners include a post-\nscript asking us to decide whether Congress also clearly au-\nthorized retroactive punitive damages in claims brought by\nforeign-national family members under state law using\n\u00a71605A(a)\u2019s exception to sovereign immunity. Sudan in-\nsists that, if we take up that question, we must account for\nthe fact that \u00a71605A(a), unlike \u00a71605A(c), does not ex-\npressly discuss punitive damages. And in fairness, Sudan\ncontends, we should also resolve whether litigants may in-\nvoke state law at all, in light of the possibility that\n\u00a71605A(c) now supplies the exclusive cause of action for\nclaims involving state-sponsored acts of terror.\n   We decline to resolve these or other matters outside the\nquestion presented. The petitioners chose to limit their pe-\ntition to the propriety of punitive damages under the fed-\neral cause of action in \u00a71605A(c). See Pet. for Cert. i. The\n\f12              OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSolicitor General observed this limitation in the question\npresented at the petition stage. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 19, n. 8. The parties\u2019 briefing and argu-\nment on matters outside the question presented has been\nlimited, too, and we think it best not to stray into new ter-\nrain on the basis of such a meager invitation and with such\nlittle assistance.\n   Still, we acknowledge one implication that necessarily\nfollows from our holding today. The court of appeals re-\nfused to allow punitive damages awards for foreign-na-\ntional family members proceeding under state law for \u201cthe\nsame reason\u201d it refused punitive damages for the plaintiffs\nproceeding under \u00a71605A(c)\u2019s federal cause of action. 864\nF. 3d, at 818. The court stressed that it would be \u201cpuzzling\u201d\nif punitive damages were permissible for state claims but\nnot federal ones. Id., at 817. Having now decided that pu-\nnitive damages are permissible for federal claims, and that\nthe reasons the court of appeals offered for its contrary de-\ncision were mistaken, it follows that the court of appeals\nmust also reconsider its decision concerning the availability\nof punitive damages for claims proceeding under state law.\n   The judgment of the court of appeals with respect to pu-\nnitive damages is vacated. The case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAVANAUGH took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2019                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

At the time, the plaintiffs faced\n  \u00a71606\u2019s bar on punitive damages for suits proceeding under any of the\n  \u00a71605 sovereign immunity exceptions. In 2008, Congress amended the\n  FSIA in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). 122 Stat. 3.\n  In NDAA \u00a71083(a), Congress moved \u00a71605(a)(7) to a new section and\n  created an express federal cause of action for acts of terror that also\n  provided for punitive damages. See \u00a71605A(c). In \u00a71083(c)(2), it gave\n  effect to existing lawsuits that had been \u201cadversely affected\u201d by prior\n  law \u201cas if\u201d they had been originally filed under the new \u00a71605A(c). And\n  in \u00a71083(c)(3), it provided a time-limited opportunity for plaintiffs to\n  file new actions \u201carising out of the same act or incident\u201d as an earlier\n  action and claim \u00a71605A\u2019s benefits. Following these amendments, the\n  original plaintiffs amended their complaint to include the new federal\n  cause of action under \u00a71605A(c), and hundreds of others filed new, sim-\n  ilar claims. The district court entered judgment for the plaintiffs and\n  awarded approximately $10.2 billion in damages, including roughly\n  $4.3 billion in punitive damages. As relevant here, the court of appeals\n  held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to punitive damages because\n  Congress had included no statement in NDAA \u00a71083 clearly authoriz-\n  ing punitive damages for preenactment conduct.\n\f2                  OPATI v.

It does admit that \u00a71083(c) author-\n izes plaintiffs to bring \u00a71605A(c) claims for preenactment conduct.\n And it does concede that \u00a71605A(c) allows for damages that \u201cmay in-\n clude economic damages, solatium, [and] pain and suffering\u201d for preen-\n actment conduct. That list in the statute also \u201cinclude[s] . . . punitive\n damages,\u201d and no plausible account of \u00a71083(c) could be clear enough\n to authorize the retroactive application of all other \u00a71605A(c) features\n except punitive damages. Sudan also contends that \u00a71605A(c)\u2019s word-\n ing \u201cmay include . . . punitive damages\u201d fails the clarity test.

In addition, all of the categories of special damages men-\n tioned in \u00a71605A(c) are provided on equal terms. Finally, Sudan sug-\n gests that a super-clarity rule should apply here because retroactive\n punitive damages raise special constitutional concerns. Such an inter-\n pretative rule is not reasonably administrable.\n    This Court declines to resolve other matters raised by the parties\n outside the question presented. But having decided that punitive dam-\n ages are permissible for federal claims and that the reasons the court\n of appeals offered for its contrary decision were mistaken, it follows\n that the court of appeals must also reconsider its decision concerning\n the availability of punitive damages for claims proceeding under state\n law.

The result was the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct (FSIA). As a baseline rule, the FSIA holds foreign\nstates and their instrumentalities immune from the juris-\ndiction of federal and state courts.

But the law also includes a number of ex-\nceptions. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71605, 1607. Of particular relevance\ntoday is the terrorism exception Congress added to the law\nin 1996. That exception permits certain plaintiffs to bring\nsuits against countries who have committed or supported\nspecified acts of terrorism and who are designated by the\nState Department as state sponsors of terror. Still, as orig-\ninally enacted, the exception shielded even these countries\nfrom the possibility of punitive damages. See Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (codifying state-\nsponsored terrorism exception at </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71605(a)(7));\n\u00a71606 (generally barring punitive damages in suits pro-\nceeding under any of \u00a71605\u2019s sovereign immunity excep-\ntions).\n   Two years after Congress amended the FSIA, al Qaeda\nattacked the U. S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In\nresponse, a group of victims and affected family members\nled by James Owens sued Sudan in federal district court,\ninvoking the newly adopted terrorism exception and alleg-\ning that Sudan had provided shelter and other material\nsupport to al Qaeda. As the suit progressed, however, a\nquestion emerged. In its recent amendments, had Congress\nmerely withdrawn immunity for state-sponsored terrorism,\nallowing plaintiffs to proceed using whatever pre-existing\ncauses of action might be available to them? Or had Con-\ngress gone further and created a new federal cause of action\nto address terrorism? Eventually, the D. C.

District Judge John Bates offered detailed\nfactual findings explaining that Sudan had knowingly\nserved as a safe haven near the two United States Embas-\nsies and allowed al Qaeda to plan and train for the attacks.\nThe court also found that Sudan had provided hundreds of\nSudanese passports to al Qaeda, allowed al Qaeda opera-\ntives to travel over the Sudan-Kenya border without re-\nstriction, and permitted the passage of weapons and money\nto supply al Qaeda\u2019s cell in Kenya.

Given the exten-\nsive and varied nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, the court\nappointed seven Special Masters to aid its factfinding.\nOver more than two years, the Special Masters conducted\nindividual damages assessments and submitted written re-\nports. Based on these reports, and after adding a substan-\ntial amount of prejudgment interest to account for the many\nyears of delay, the district court awarded a total of approx-\nimately $10.2 billion in damages, including roughly $4.3\nbillion in punitive damages to plaintiffs who had brought\nsuit in the wake of the 2008 amendments.\n   At that point, Sudan decided to appear and appeal.\nAmong other things, Sudan sought to undo the district\ncourt\u2019s punitive damages award.

The court noted that, in passing the\nNDAA, Congress clearly authorized individuals to use the\nPrior Actions and Related Actions provisions to bring new\nfederal claims attacking past conduct.

There, the Court\nobserved that, \u201cin decisions spanning two centuries,\u201d we\nhave approached debates about statutory meaning with an\nassumption that Congress means its legislation to respect\nthe principle of prospectivity and apply only to future con-\nduct\u2014and that, if and when Congress wishes to test its\npower to legislate retrospectively, it must say so \u201cclear[ly].\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n<span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 272. </span><pre class=\"inline\">All this is important, Sudan tells us, because\nwhen we look to the NDAA we will find no clear statement\nallowing courts to award punitive damages for past con-\nduct.\n   But if Sudan focuses on the rule, the petitioners highlight\nan exception suggested by Altmann.

Thus, Altmann held, \u201c[i]n th[e] sui generis\ncontext [of foreign sovereign immunity], . . . it [is] more ap-\npropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most re-\ncent decision [of the political branches] than to presume\nthat decision inapplicable merely because it postdates the\nconduct in question.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134749\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\"><a href=\"/opinion/134749/republicof-austria-v-altmann/\"><span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span></a></span> And, the petitioners </span><pre class=\"inline\">stress, once\nthe presumption of prospectivity is swept away, the NDAA\nis easily read to authorize punitive damages for completed\nconduct.\n   Really, this summary only begins to scratch the surface\nof the parties\u2019 debate. Sudan replies that it may be one\nthing to retract immunity retroactively consistent with Alt-\nmann, because all that does is open a forum to hear an oth-\nerwise available legal claim. But it is another thing entirely\nto create new rules regulating primary conduct and impose\nthem retroactively. When Congress wishes to do that, Su-\ndan says, it must speak just as clearly as Landgraf com-\nmanded. And, Sudan adds, the NDAA didn\u2019t simply open a\nnew forum to hear a pre-existing claim; it also created a new\ncause of action governing completed conduct that the peti-\ntioners now seek to exploit. Cf. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134749\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Altmann,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/134749/republicof-austria-v-altmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\u2013\n704 (Scalia, J., concurring). In turn, the petitioners retort\nthat Altmann itself might have concerned whether a new\nforum could hear an otherwise available and pre-existing\nclaim, but its reasoning went further. According to the pe-\ntitioners, the decision also strongly suggested that the pre-\nsumption of prospectivity does not apply at all when it\ncomes to suits against foreign sovereigns, full stop. These\npoints and more the parties develop through much of their\nbriefing before us.\n   As we see it, however, there is no need to resolve the par-\nties\u2019 debate over interpretive presumptions. Even if we as-\nsume (without granting) that Sudan may claim the benefit\nof Landgraf \u2019s presumption of prospectivity, Congress was\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nas clear as it could have been when it authorized plaintiffs\nto seek and win punitive damages for past conduct using\n\u00a71065A(c)\u2019s new federal cause of action. After all, in\n\u00a71083(a), Congress created a federal cause of action that ex-\npressly allows suits for damages that \u201cmay include eco-\nnomic damages, solatium, pain and suffering, and punitive\ndamages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This new cause of action was\nhoused in a new provision of the U. S. Code, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\u00a71605A, to which the FSIA\u2019s usual prohibition on punitive\ndamages does not apply. See \u00a71606. Then, in \u00a7\u00a71083(c)(2)\nand (c)(3) of the very same statute, Congress allowed cer-\ntain plaintiffs in \u201cPrior Actions\u201d and \u201cRelated Actions\u201d to\ninvoke the new federal cause of action in \u00a71605A. Both pro-\nvisions specifically authorized new claims for preenactment\nconduct. Put another way, Congress proceeded in two\nequally evident steps: (1) It expressly authorized punitive\ndamages under a new cause of action; and (2) it explicitly\nmade that new cause of action available to remedy certain\npast acts of terrorism. Neither step presents any ambigu-\nity, nor is the NDAA fairly susceptible to any competing in-\nterpretation.\n   Sudan\u2019s primary rejoinder only serves to underscore the\nconclusion. Like the court of appeals before it, Sudan\nstresses that \u00a71083(c) itself contains no express authoriza-\ntion of punitive damages. But it\u2019s hard to see what differ-\nence that makes. Sudan admits that \u00a71083(c) authorizes\nplaintiffs to bring claims under \u00a71605A(c) for acts commit-\nted before the 2008 amendments. Sudan concedes, too, that\n\u00a71605A(c) authorizes plaintiffs to seek and win \u201ceconomic\ndamages, solatium, [and] pain and suffering,\u201d for preenact-\nment conduct. In fact, except for the two words \u201cpunitive\ndamages,\u201d Sudan accepts that every other jot and tittle of\n\u00a71605A(c) applies to actions properly brought under\n\u00a71083(c) for past conduct. And we can see no plausible ac-\ncount on which \u00a71083(c) could be clear enough to authorize\nthe retroactive application of all other features of\n\f10              OPATI v. REPUBLIC OF SUDAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71605A(c), just not these two words.\n   Sudan next contends that \u00a71605A(c) fails to authorize ret-\nroactive punitive damages with sufficient clarity because it\nsounds equivocal\u2014the provision says only that awards\n\u201cmay\u201d include punitive damages. But this language simply\nvests district courts with discretion to determine whether\npunitive damages are appropriate in view of the facts of a\nparticular case. As we have repeatedly observed when dis-\ncussing remedial provisions using similar language, \u201cthe\n\u2018word \u201cmay\u201d clearly connotes discretion.\u2019 \u201d Halo Electronics,\nInc. v.

What\u2019s\nmore, all of the categories of special damages mentioned in\n\u00a71605A(c) are provided on equal terms: \u201c[D]amages may\ninclude economic damages, solatium, pain and suffering,\nand punitive damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Sudan admits\nthat the statute vests the district court with discretion to\naward the first three kinds of damages for preenactment\nconduct\u2014and the same can be no less true when it comes to\nthe fourth.\n   That takes us to Sudan\u2019s final argument. Maybe Con-\ngress did act clearly when it authorized a new cause of ac-\ntion and other forms of damages for past conduct. But be-\ncause retroactive damages of the punitive variety raise\nspecial constitutional concerns, Sudan says, we should cre-\nate and apply a new rule requiring Congress to provide a\nsuper-clear statement when it wishes to authorize their\nuse.\n   We decline this invitation. It\u2019s true that punitive dam-\nages aren\u2019t merely a form a compensation but a form of pun-\nishment, and we don\u2019t doubt that applying new punish-\nments to completed conduct can raise serious constitutional\nquestions.

That sounds much less like an administrable rule\nof law than an appeal to the eye of the beholder.\n                               *\n   With the question presented now resolved, both sides ask\nus to tackle other matters in this long-running litigation.\nPerhaps most significantly, the petitioners include a post-\nscript asking us to decide whether Congress also clearly au-\nthorized retroactive punitive damages in claims brought by\nforeign-national family members under state law using\n\u00a71605A(a)\u2019s exception to sovereign immunity. Sudan in-\nsists that, if we take up that question, we must account for\nthe fact that \u00a71605A(a), unlike \u00a71605A(c), does not ex-\npressly discuss punitive damages.

Decided May 14, 2020\n\n  The application to vacate stay presented to JUSTICE\nALITO and by him referred to the Court is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE\nGINSBURG joins, respecting the denial of application to va-\ncate stay.\n  In this lawsuit, inmates in a Texas geriatric prison allege\nthat their facility failed to protect them from the dangers of\nCovid\u201319. The District Court heard unrebutted testimony\nabout the imminent dangers faced by the inmates, some of\nwhom have already died. It also heard testimony about the\nfacility\u2019s lackluster efforts to keep the illness from spread-\ning and held that the facility\u2019s inexplicable failures\namounted to deliberate indifference for its elderly inmates\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment. On that basis, it\nissued an injunction requiring the prison to follow an exten-\nsive protocol, including frequent cleaning and increased ed-\nucation efforts. 2020 WL 1899 274 (SD Tex., Apr. 16, 2020).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed that in-\njunction pending appeal, and the inmates now seek to va-\ncate that stay in this Court. 966 F. 3d 797 (2020) (per cu-\nriam).\n  Notably, where the Court is asked to undo a stay issued\nbelow, the bar is high. Among other things, applicants\nmust show that the lower court was \u201c \u2018demonstrably wrong\nin its application of accepted standards in deciding to issue\nthe stay.\u2019 \u201d Western Airlines, Inc. v.

The Fifth\nCircuit ruled, among other things, that the prison was\nsubstantially likely to succeed on its claim that the inmates\nfailed to exhaust their remedies as required by the Prison\nLitigation and Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71997e(a). Under the circumstances of this case, where\nthe inmates filed a lawsuit before filing any grievance with\nthe prison itself, it is hard to conclude that the Fifth Circuit\nwas demonstrably wrong on this preliminary procedural\nholding.\n   I write separately to highlight the disturbing allegations\npresented below. Further, where plaintiffs demonstrate\nthat a prison grievance system cannot or will not respond\nto an inmate\u2019s complaint, they could well satisfy an excep-\ntion to the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. Finally, while\nStates and prisons retain discretion in how they respond to\nhealth emergencies, federal courts do have an obligation to\nensure that prisons are not deliberately indifferent in the\nface of danger and death.\n                               I\n   The facility at issue (the Pack Unit) houses about 1,200\ninmates, more than 800 of whom are 65 or older. As the\nDistrict Court found, the risk of Covid\u201319 spreading in the\nPack Unit is particularly high. The facility is a dormitory-\nstyle prison, with each inmate separated only by a short,\ncubicle-style half-wall. When the District Court issued its\nruling, Covid\u201319 had already begun to spread in the facil-\nity. On April 11, 2020, one inmate, Leonard Clerkly, was\ntransferred to the hospital because of difficulty breathing,\na symptom the hospital linked to Covid\u201319. He was pro-\nnounced dead mere hours later.\n   Before and after Clerkly\u2019s death, prison administrators\nbegan implementing policies to control the spread of Covid\u2013\n19. For instance, the prison placed all inmates on a precau-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

It also established a policy of providing\ninmates with cloth masks to be changed daily and in-\nstructed inmates to request additional soap at no cost. But\nthe District Court found that the facility inexplicably failed\nto comply with some of its self-declared policies.\n    The District Court heard unrefuted testimony that, de-\nspite the prison\u2019s claim of enhanced cleaning measures, its\ncleaning protocol in practice remained virtually the same.\nThe facility neither increased the number of inmate janitors\nnor ensured that the existing janitors did their jobs safely\nand effectively. One janitor testified that, just as before the\npandemic, the cleaning solution provided to the cleaning\ncrews was frequently depleted by midafternoon, only half-\nway through a shift. Each day he received only one pair of\ngloves to share with his co-janitor, an arrangement medical\nexperts described as tantamount to no gloves at all. 2020\nWL 1916883, *5\u2013*6, *10 (SD Tex., Apr. 20, 2020).\n    The facility\u2019s failures to comply with its own safety proto-\ncol became even clearer after Clerkly\u2019s death. Prison poli-\ncies required that any inmate showing signs of Covid\u201319 be\n\u201c \u2018triaged\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018placed in medical isolation\u2019 \u201d and that all\nareas used by the symptomatic inmate be thoroughly disin-\nfected. Id., at *11. Yet even though Clerkly had difficulty\nbreathing and died only a few hours after being transported\nto the hospital, the prison \u201cmade no representations\u201d to the\nDistrict Court that \u201cthey identified Mr. Clerkly as sympto-\nmatic, evaluated him for potential COVID-19 infection, or\nisolated or treated him for COVID-19 at any point before\nhis transport to the hospital on the day of his death.\u201d Ibid.\nIn fact, the prison \u201cdid not implement further precaution-\nary measures until three days after Mr. Clerkly\u2019s death.\u201d\nIbid. In the meantime, while the prison waited for a posi-\ntive Covid\u201319 test that seemed certain to come, \u201ccountless\ninmates were knowingly exposed to a serious substantial\nrisk of harm.\u201d Ibid.\n\f4                      VALENTINE v. COLLIER\n\n                      Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n                              II\n   Having heard testimony from several witnesses from the\nPack Unit and from prison experts who declared the Pack\nUnit practices \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d the District Court\nheld that applicants were likely to succeed on their Eighth\nAmendment claim. Id., at *12. The court noted the \u201cobvi-\nous\u201d risk of Covid\u201319 to the older men in the Pack Unit and\nreasoned that the prison\u2019s failure to take basic steps, many\nof which were required by its own policies, evinced deliber-\nate indifference. Id., *10, *13. The District Court then or-\ndered the prison to mitigate the harm to inmates, including\nthrough some measures recommended by an expert witness\nwho had managed prisons himself. Id., at *6\u2013*7, *9\u2013*12;\n2020 WL 1899274.\n   Despite the District Court\u2019s detailed, careful findings,\nbased on live testimony and the court\u2019s own visit to the Pack\nUnit, the Fifth Circuit stayed the injunction. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit noted that the prison had submitted evidence of \u201cthe\nprotective measures it ha[d] taken as a result\u201d of the Covid\u2013\n19 pandemic, and so the question was simply whether the\nEighth Amendment required the prison \u201cto do more.\u201d 956\nF. 3d, at ___ \u2013 ___.1 But in crediting the prison\u2019s assur-\nances, the Fifth Circuit did not address all of the District\nCourt\u2019s factual findings that the prison had inexplicably\ndiscarded its own rules and, in doing so, evinced deliberate\nindifference to the medical needs of its inmates.2 See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 One member of the Fifth Circuit panel concurred in judgment. See\n\n956 F. 3d, at ___ (opinion of Higginson, J.). The concurrence reasoned\nthat the inmates were unlikely to prevail on exhaustion, but noted that\na merits panel could find on a full record that an exception to the PLRA\u2019s\nexhaustion requirement applied. The concurrence also argued that the\nmotions panel should not have addressed the merits of the inmates\u2019 \u201cin-\ntensely fact-based\u201d claims in light of the District Court\u2019s \u201cextensive and\ncareful findings of fact that mitigation deficiencies still exist\u201d in the\nprison. Id., at ___.\n  2 The Fifth Circuit also faulted the District Court for imposing stand-\n\nards higher than those recommended by the Centers for Disease Control\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                      5\n\n                       Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 842 (1994) (noting that\ndeliberate indifference is a question of fact often made out\nby \u201cinference from circumstantial evidence\u201d). The Fifth Cir-\ncuit may have acted outside its authority in refusing to de-\nfer to those factual findings. See Anderson v. Bessemer City,\n470 U. S. 564, 573 (1985). Similarly, while the Fifth Circuit\nfaulted the District Court for issuing an admittedly exact-\ning injunction, that injunction too was rooted in equally de-\ntailed factfinding regarding the prison\u2019s failure to live up to\nits promises.\n   Also concerning was some of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s language\nregarding exhaustion. This Court has made clear that the\nPLRA requires exhaustion only of \u201cavailable\u201d judicial rem-\nedies. Ross v. Blake, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at\n8). \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of the word \u2018available\u2019 is \u2018capa-\nble of use for the accomplishment of a purpose.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(some internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, when a\ngrievance procedure is a \u201cdead end\u201d\u2014when \u201cthe facts on the\nground\u201d indicate that the grievance procedure provides no\npossibility of relief\u2014the procedures may well be \u201cunavaila-\nble.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n   The Fifth Circuit seemed to reject the possibility that\ngrievance procedures could ever be a \u201cdead end\u201d even if they\ncould not provide relief before an inmate faced a serious risk\nof death. But if a plaintiff has established that the prison\ngrievance procedures at issue are utterly incapable of re-\nsponding to a rapidly spreading pandemic like Covid\u201319,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nand Prevention (CDC). But as the District Court noted, the CDC Guide-\nlines themselves caution that they \u201cmay need to be adapted based on\nindividual facilities\u2019 physical space, staffing, population, operations, and\nother resources and conditions.\u201d 2020 WL 1916883, *12 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Given the particular vulnerabilities of the inmates\nin the Pack Unit, even counsel for the prison admitted that steps beyond\nthose prescribed by the CDC may be necessary. Ibid. And, of course, the\nDistrict Court found that the prison was regularly failing to comply with\nstandards far below what the CDC suggests. Much of its injunction tar-\ngeted that behavior.\n\f6                  VALENTINE v. COLLIER\n\n                   Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nthe procedures may be \u201cunavailable\u201d to meet the plaintiff\u2019s\npurposes, much in the way they would be if prison officials\nignored the grievances entirely. Ibid. Here, of course, it is\ndifficult to tell whether the prison\u2019s system fits in that nar-\nrow category, as applicants did not attempt to avail them-\nselves of the grievance process before filing suit. But I cau-\ntion that in these unprecedented circumstances, where an\ninmate faces an imminent risk of harm that the grievance\nprocess cannot or does not answer, the PLRA\u2019s textual ex-\nception could open the courthouse doors where they would\notherwise stay closed.\n                              III\n   While I disagree with much of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis\nat this preliminary juncture, the court required reports\nevery 10 days on the status of the inmates in the prison\u2019s\ncare. I expect that it and other courts will be vigilant in\nprotecting the constitutional rights of those like applicants.\nAs the circumstances of this case make clear, the stakes\ncould not be higher. Just a few nights ago, respondents re-\nvealed that \u201cnumerous inmates and staff members\u201d at the\nPack Unit \u201care now COVID-19 positive and the vast major-\nity of those tested positive within the past two weeks.\u201d\nSupp. Brief Regarding Emergency Application 1.\n   Nothing in this Court\u2019s order, of course, prevents the\nFifth Circuit from amending its stay. Nor does anything in\nour order prevent applicants from seeking new relief in the\nDistrict Court, as appropriate, based on changed circum-\nstances. Finally, administrative convenience must be bal-\nanced against the risk of danger presented by emergency\nsituations. The prison, for example, has failed to explain\nwhy it could not simply decrease dorm density, despite hav-\ning an empty unit at its disposal.\n   It has long been said that a society\u2019s worth can be judged\nby taking stock of its prisons. That is all the truer in this\npandemic, where inmates everywhere have been rendered\n\f                Cite as: 590 U.

Finally, administrative convenience must be bal-\nanced against the risk of danger presented by emergency\nsituations.

Argued January 13, 2020\u2014Decided May 14, 2020\nPetitioners (collectively Lucky Brand) and respondent (Marcel) both use\n  the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of their marks on jeans and other apparel.\n  Marcel received a trademark registration for the phrase \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d\n  and Lucky Brand uses the registered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and\n  other marks with the word \u201cLucky.\u201d This has led to nearly 20 years of\n  litigation, proceeding in three rounds. The first round resulted in a\n  2003 settlement agreement in which Lucky Brand agreed to stop using\n  the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and Marcel agreed to release any claims re-\n  garding Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own trademarks. In the second round\n  (2005 Action), Lucky Brand sued Marcel and its licensee for violating\n  its trademarks. Marcel filed several counterclaims turning, as rele-\n  vant here, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d but\n  it did not claim that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own marks alone in-\n  fringed the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark. In both a motion to dismiss the coun-\n  terclaims and an answer to them, Lucky Brand argued that the coun-\n  terclaims were barred by the settlement agreement, but it did not\n  invoke that defense later in the proceedings. The court in the 2005\n  Action permanently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\n  Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark, and a jury found against Lucky Brand on\n  Marcel\u2019s remaining counterclaims. In the third round (2011 Action),\n  Marcel sued Lucky Brand for continuing to infringe the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d\n  mark, but it did not reprise its 2005 allegation about Lucky Brand\u2019s\n  use of the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. After protracted litigation, Lucky\n  Brand moved to dismiss, arguing\u2014for the first time since early in the\n  2005 Action\u2014that Marcel had released its claims in the settlement\n  agreement. Marcel countered that Lucky Brand could not invoke the\n  release defense because it could have pursued that defense in the 2005\n\f2                LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                  MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                            Syllabus\n\n    Action but did not. The District Court granted Lucky Brand\u2019s motion\n    to dismiss. The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding that\n    \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d prohibited Lucky Brand from raising an unliti-\n    gated defense that it should have raised earlier.\nHeld: Because Marcel\u2019s 2011 Action challenged different conduct\u2014and\n raised different claims\u2014from the 2005 Action, Marcel cannot preclude\n Lucky Brand from raising new defenses. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (a) This case asks whether so-called \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d is a valid\n application of res judicata: a term comprising the doctrine of issue pre-\n clusion, which precludes a party from relitigating an issue actually de-\n cided in a prior action and necessary to the judgment, and the doctrine\n of claim preclusion, which prevents parties from raising issues that\n could have been raised and decided in a prior action. Any preclusion\n of defenses must, at a minimum, satisfy the strictures of issue preclu-\n sion or claim preclusion. See, e.g., Davis v. Brown, 94 U. S. 423, 428.\n Here, issue preclusion does not apply, so the causes of action must\n share a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact[s]\u201d for claim preclusion to\n apply, Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a724, Comment b, p. 199.\n Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Because the two suits here involved different marks and differ-\n ent conduct occurring at different times, they did not share a \u201ccommon\n nucleus of operative facts.\u201d The 2005 claims depended on Lucky\n Brand\u2019s alleged use of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d But in the 2011 Action, Marcel\n alleged that the infringement was Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its other marks\n containing the word \u201cLucky,\u201d not any use of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d itself. The\n conduct in the 2011 Action also occurred after the conclusion of the\n 2005 Action. But claim preclusion generally \u201c \u2018does not bar claims that\n are predicated on events that postdate the filing of the initial com-\n plaint,\u2019 \u201d Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. ___, ___, be-\n cause events occurring after a plaintiff files suit often give rise to new\n \u201coperative facts\u201d creating a new claim to relief. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    (c) Marcel claims that treatises and this Court\u2019s cases support a ver-\n sion of \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d that extends to the facts of this case. But\n none of those authorities describe scenarios applicable here, and they\n are unlikely to stand for anything more than that traditional claim or\n issue preclusion principles may bar defenses raised in a subsequent\n suit\u2014principles that do not bar Lucky Brand\u2019s release defense here.\n Pp. 10\u201312.\n898 F. 3d 232, reversed and remanded.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\f                        Cite as: 590 U.

(Marcel). In the latest lawsuit between the two,\nLucky Brand asserted a defense against Marcel that it had\nnot pressed fully in a preceding suit between the parties.\nThis Court is asked to determine whether Lucky Brand\u2019s\nfailure to litigate the defense in the earlier suit barred\nLucky Brand from invoking it in the later suit. Because the\nparties agree that, at a minimum, the preclusion of such a\ndefense in this context requires that the two suits share the\nsame claim to relief\u2014and because we find that the two suits\nhere did not\u2014Lucky Brand was not barred from raising its\ndefense in the later action.\n                             I\n  Marcel and Lucky Brand both sell jeans and other ap-\nparel. Both entities also use the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of\ntheir marks on clothing. In 1986, Marcel received a federal\ntrademark registration for \u201cGet Lucky\u201d; a few years later,\n\f2            LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin 1990, Lucky Brand began selling apparel using the reg-\nistered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and other marks that in-\nclude the word \u201cLucky.\u201d 779 F. 3d 102, 105 (CA2 2015).\n   Three categories of marks are at issue in this case: Mar-\ncel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark; Lucky Brand\u2019s \u201cLucky Brand\u201d\nmark; and various other marks owned by Lucky Brand that\ncontain the word \u201cLucky.\u201d These trademarks have led to\nnearly 20 years of litigation between the two companies,\nproceeding in three rounds.\n                             A\n  In 2001\u2014the first round\u2014Marcel sued Lucky Brand, al-\nleging that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d in\nadvertisements infringed Marcel\u2019s trademark. In 2003, the\nparties signed a settlement agreement. As part of the deal,\nLucky Brand agreed to stop using the phrase \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d\nApp. 191. In exchange, Marcel agreed to release any claims\nregarding Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own trademarks. Id., at\n191\u2013192.\n                             B\n   The ink was barely dry on the settlement agreement\nwhen, in 2005, the parties began a second round of litiga-\ntion (2005 Action). Lucky Brand filed suit, alleging that\nMarcel and its licensee violated its trademarks by copying\nits designs and logos in a new clothing line. As relevant\nhere, Marcel filed several counterclaims that all turned, in\nlarge part, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet\nLucky\u201d: One batch of allegations asserted that Lucky Brand\nhad continued to use Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark in viola-\ntion of the settlement agreement, while others alleged that\nLucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and \u201cLucky\nBrand\u201d together was \u201cconfusingly similar to\u201d\u2014and thus in-\nfringed\u2013\u2013Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

After the District Court denied the\nmotion without prejudice, Lucky Brand noted the release\ndefense once more in its answer to Marcel\u2019s counterclaims.\nBut as the 2005 Action proceeded, Lucky Brand never again\ninvoked the release defense.\n   The 2005 Action concluded in two phases. First, as a\nsanction for misconduct during discovery, the District\nCourt concluded that Lucky Brand violated the settlement\nagreement by continuing to use \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and perma-\nnently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\nMarcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

The injunction did not enjoin,\nor even mention, Lucky Brand\u2019s use of any other marks or\nphrases containing the word \u201cLucky.\u201d Order Granting Par-\ntial Summary Judgment and Injunction, Doc. 183. The case\nthen proceeded to trial. The jury found against Lucky\nBrand on Marcel\u2019s remaining counterclaims\u2014those that al-\nleged infringement from Lucky Brand\u2019s continued use of the\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d catchphrase alongside its own marks. See\nBrief for Respondent 52.\n                              C\n   In April 2011, the third round of litigation began: Marcel\nfiled an action against Lucky Brand (2011 Action), main-\ntaining that Lucky Brand continued to infringe Marcel\u2019s\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark and, in so doing, contravened the judg-\nment issued in the 2005 Action.\n   This complaint did not reprise Marcel\u2019s earlier allegation\n(in the 2005 Action) that Lucky Brand continued to use the\n\f4               LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                 MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. Marcel argued only that Lucky\nBrand\u2019s continued, post-2010 use of Lucky Brand\u2019s own\nmarks\u2014some of which used the word \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014infringed\nMarcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark in a manner that (according to\nMarcel) was previously found infringing.1 Marcel requested\nthat the District Court enjoin Lucky Brand from using any\nof Lucky Brand\u2019s marks containing the word \u201cLucky.\u201d\n   The District Court granted Lucky Brand summary judg-\nment, concluding that Marcel\u2019s claims in the 2011 Action\nwere essentially the same as its counterclaims in the 2005\nAction.\n   But the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disa-\ngreed. 779 F. 3d 102. The court concluded that Marcel\u2019s\nclaims in the 2011 Action were distinct from those it had\nasserted in the 2005 Action, because the claims at issue in\nthe 2005 Action were \u201cfor earlier infringements.\u201d Id., at\n110. As the court noted, \u201c[w]inning a judgment . . . does not\ndeprive the plaintiff of the right to sue\u201d for the defendant\u2019s\n\u201csubsequent similar violations.\u201d Id., at 107.\n   The Second Circuit further rejected Marcel\u2019s request to\nhold Lucky Brand in contempt for violating the injunction\nissued in the 2005 Action. The court noted that the conduct\nat issue in the 2011 Action was Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own\nmarks\u2014not the use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d By contrast,\nthe 2005 injunction prohibited Lucky Brand from using the\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark\u2014not Lucky Brand\u2019s own marks that hap-\npened to contain the word \u201cLucky.\u201d Id., at 111.

The court vacated and remanded for\nfurther proceedings.\n   On remand to the District Court, Lucky Brand moved to\ndismiss, arguing\u2014for the first time since its motion to dis-\nmiss and answer in the 2005 Action\u2014that Marcel had re-\nleased its claims by entering the settlement agreement.\nMarcel countered that Lucky Brand was precluded from in-\nvoking the release defense, because it could have pursued\nthe defense fully in the 2005 Action but had neglected to do\nso. The District Court granted Lucky Brand\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss, holding that it could assert its release defense and\nthat the settlement agreement indeed barred Marcel\u2019s\nclaims.\n   The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding\nthat a doctrine it termed \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d prohibited\nLucky Brand from raising the release defense in the 2011\nAction. 898 F. 3d 232 (2018). Noting that a different cate-\ngory of preclusion\u2014issue preclusion\u2014may be wielded\nagainst a defendant, see Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439\nU. S. 322 (1979), the court reasoned that the same should\nbe true of claim preclusion: A defendant should be pre-\ncluded from raising an unlitigated defense that it should\nhave raised earlier. The panel then held that \u201cdefense pre-\nclusion\u201d bars a party from raising a defense where: \u201c(i) a\nprevious action involved an adjudication on the merits\u201d; \u201c(ii)\nthe previous action involved the same parties\u201d; \u201c(iii) the de-\nfense was either asserted or could have been asserted, in\nthe prior action\u201d; and \u201c(iv) the district court, in its discre-\ntion, concludes that preclusion of the defense is appropri-\nate.\u201d 898 F. 3d, at 241. Finding each factor satisfied in this\ncase, the panel vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment. We\ngranted certiorari, 588 U. S. ___ (2019), to resolve differ-\nences among the Circuits regarding when, if ever, claim\n\f6            LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\npreclusion applies to defenses raised in a later suit.

Wright, H. Miller, & E. Cooper, Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure \u00a74402 (3d ed. 2016) (Wright &\nMiller). The first is issue preclusion (sometimes called col-\nlateral estoppel), which precludes a party from relitigating\nan issue actually decided in a prior case and necessary to\nthe judgment. Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 94 (1980);\nsee Parklane Hosiery, 439 U. S., at 326, n. 5.\n    The second doctrine is claim preclusion (sometimes itself\ncalled res judicata). Unlike issue preclusion, claim preclu-\nsion prevents parties from raising issues that could have\nbeen raised and decided in a prior action\u2014even if they were\nnot actually litigated. If a later suit advances the same\nclaim as an earlier suit between the same parties, the ear-\nlier suit\u2019s judgment \u201cprevents litigation of all grounds for,\nor defenses to, recovery that were previously available to\nthe parties, regardless of whether they were asserted or de-\ntermined in the prior proceeding.\u201d Brown v. Felsen, 442\nU. S. 127, 131 (1979); see also Wright & Miller \u00a74407.

Sturgell,\n553 U. S. 880, 892, n. 5 (2008). \u201cIf the plaintiff wins, the\nentire claim is merged in the judgment; the plaintiff cannot\nbring a second independent action for additional relief, and\nthe defendant cannot avoid the judgment by offering new\ndefenses.\u201d Wright & Miller \u00a74406. But \u201c[i]f the second law-\nsuit involves a new claim or cause of action, the parties may\nraise assertions or defenses that were omitted from the first\nlawsuit even though they were equally relevant to the first\ncause of action.\u201d Ibid.\n   As the Second Circuit itself seemed to recognize, see 898\nF. 3d, at 236\u2013237, this Court has never explicitly recognized\n\u201cdefense preclusion\u201d as a standalone category of res judi-\ncata, unmoored from the two guideposts of issue preclusion\nand claim preclusion. Instead, our case law indicates that\nany such preclusion of defenses must, at a minimum, sat-\nisfy the strictures of issue preclusion or claim preclusion.\nSee, e.g., Davis v. Brown, 94 U. S. 423, 428 (1877) (holding\nthat where two lawsuits involved different claims, preclu-\nsion operates \u201conly upon the matter actually at issue and\ndetermined in the original action\u201d).2 The parties thus agree\nthat where, as here, issue preclusion does not apply, a de-\nfense can be barred only if the \u201ccauses of action are the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 There may be good reasons to question any application of claim pre-\n\nclusion to defenses. It has been noted that in suits involving successive\nclaims against the same defendant, courts often \u201cassum[e] that the de-\nfendant may raise defenses in the second action that were not raised in\nthe first, even though they were equally available and relevant in both\nactions.\u201d Wright & Miller \u00a74414. This is because \u201c[v]arious considera-\ntions, other than actual merits, may govern\u201d whether to bring a defense,\n\u201csuch as the smallness of the amount or the value of the property in con-\ntroversy, the difficulty of obtaining the necessary evidence, the expense\nof the litigation, and [a party\u2019s] own situation.\u201d Cromwell v. County of\nSac, 94 U. S. 351, 356 (1877). Here, however, this Court need not deter-\nmine when (if ever) applying claim preclusion to defenses may be appro-\npriate, because a necessary predicate\u2014identity of claims\u2014is lacking.\n\f8            LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nsame\u201d in the two suits\u2014that is, where they share a \u201c \u2018com-\nmon nucleus of operative fact[s].\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 2,\n27, 31, 50; accord, Reply Brief 3.\n                                B\n   Put simply, the two suits here were grounded on different\nconduct, involving different marks, occurring at different\ntimes. They thus did not share a \u201ccommon nucleus of oper-\native facts.\u201d Restatement (Second) \u00a724, Comment b, at 199.\n   To start, claims to relief may be the same for the purposes\nof claim preclusion if, among other things, \u201c \u2018a different\njudgment in the second action would impair or destroy\nrights or interests established by the judgment entered in\nthe first action.\u2019 \u201d Wright & Miller \u00a74407. Here, however,\nthe 2011 Action did not imperil the judgment of the 2005\nAction because the lawsuits involved both different conduct\nand different trademarks.\n   In the 2005 Action, Marcel alleged that Lucky Brand in-\nfringed Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark both by directly imitat-\ning its \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark and by using the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d slo-\ngan alongside Lucky Brand\u2019s other marks in a way that\ncreated consumer confusion. Brief for Respondent 52. Mar-\ncel appears to admit, thus, that its claims in the 2005 Action\ndepended on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged use of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d Id.,\nat 9\u201310 (\u201cMarcel\u2019s reverse-confusion theory [in the 2005 Ac-\ntion] depended, in part, on Lucky\u2019s continued imitation of\nthe GET LUCKY mark\u201d).\n   By contrast, the 2011 Action did not involve any alleged\nuse of the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. Indeed, Lucky Brand had\nbeen enjoined in the 2005 Action from using \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d\nand in the 2011 Action, Lucky Brand was found not to have\nviolated that injunction. 779 F. 3d, at 111\u2013112. The parties\nthus do not argue that Lucky Brand continued to use \u201cGet\nLucky\u201d after the 2005 Action concluded, and at oral argu-\nment, counsel for Marcel appeared to confirm that Marcel\u2019s\nclaims in the 2011 Action did not allege that Lucky Brand\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontinued to use \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Instead,\nMarcel alleged in the 2011 Action that Lucky Brand com-\nmitted infringement by using Lucky Brand\u2019s own marks\ncontaining the word \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014not the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark it-\nself. Plainly, then, the 2011 Action challenged different\nconduct, involving different marks.\n   Not only that, but the complained-of conduct in the 2011\nAction occurred after the conclusion of the 2005 Action.\nClaim preclusion generally \u201cdoes not bar claims that are\npredicated on events that postdate the filing of the initial\ncomplaint.\u201d Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S.\n___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U. S.\n322, 327\u2013328 (1955) (holding that two suits were not \u201cbased\non the same cause of action,\u201d because \u201c[t]he conduct pres-\nently complained of was all subsequent to\u201d the prior judg-\nment and it \u201ccannot be given the effect of extinguishing\nclaims which did not even then exist and which could not\npossibly have been sued upon in the previous case\u201d). This\nis for good reason: Events that occur after the plaintiff files\nsuit often give rise to new \u201c[m]aterial operative facts\u201d that\n\u201cin themselves, or taken in conjunction with the antecedent\nfacts,\u201d create a new claim to relief.

As Lucky Brand points out, liability\nfor trademark infringement turns on marketplace realities\nthat can change dramatically from year to year. Brief for\nPetitioners 42\u201345. It is no surprise, then, that the Second\nCircuit held that Marcel\u2019s 2011 Action claims were not\nbarred by the 2005 Action. By the same token, the 2005\n\f10           LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nAction could not bar Lucky Brand\u2019s 2011 defenses.\n  At bottom, the 2011 Action involved different marks, dif-\nferent legal theories, and different conduct\u2014occurring at\ndifferent times. Because the two suits thus lacked a \u201ccom-\nmon nucleus of operative facts,\u201d claim preclusion did not\nand could not bar Lucky Brand from asserting its settle-\nment agreement defense in the 2011 Action.\n                             III\n   Resisting this conclusion, Marcel points to treatises and\nthis Court\u2019s cases, arguing that they support a version of\n\u201cdefense preclusion\u201d doctrine that extends to the facts of\nthis case. Brief for Respondent 24\u201326. But these authori-\nties do no such thing. As an initial matter, regardless of\nwhat those authorities might imply about \u201cdefense preclu-\nsion,\u201d none of them describe scenarios applicable here.\nMoreover, we doubt that these authorities stand for any-\nthing more than that traditional claim- or issue-preclusion\nprinciples may bar defenses raised in a subsequent suit\u2014\nprinciples that, as explained above, do not bar Lucky\nBrand\u2019s release defense here.\n   Take, for example, cases that involve either judgment en-\nforcement or a collateral attack on a prior judgment. Id., at\n26\u201335. In the former scenario, a party takes action to en-\nforce a prior judgment already issued against another; in\nthe latter, a party seeks to avoid the effect of a prior judg-\nment by bringing a suit to undo it. If, in either situation, a\ndifferent outcome in the second action \u201cwould nullify the in-\nitial judgment or would impair rights established in the in-\nitial action,\u201d preclusion principles would be at play. Re-\nstatement (Second) \u00a722(b), at 185; Wright & Miller \u00a74414.\nIn both scenarios, courts simply apply claim preclusion or\nissue preclusion to prohibit a claim or defense that would\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Lucky Brand\u2019s defense in the 2011 Action did not\nthreaten the judgment issued in the 2005 Action or, as Mar-\ncel argues, \u201cachieve the same practical result\u201d that the\nabove-mentioned principles seek to avoid. Brief for Re-\nspondent 31\u201332. Indeed, while the judgment in the 2005\nAction plainly prohibited Lucky Brand from using \u201cGet\nLucky,\u201d it did not do the same with respect to Lucky Brand\u2019s\ncontinued, standalone use of its own marks containing the\nword \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014the only conduct at issue in the 2011 Action.\nPut simply, Lucky Brand\u2019s defense to new claims in the\n2011 Action did not risk impairing the 2005 judgment.\n  Nor do cases like Beloit v. Morgan, 7 Wall. 619 (1869), aid\nMarcel. See Brief for Respondent 32\u201333. To be sure, Beloit\nheld that a defendant in a second suit over bonds \u201cof the\nsame issue\u201d was precluded from raising a defense it had not\nraised in the first suit. 7 Wall., at 620. But the Court there\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 One might ask: If any preclusion of defenses (under the claim-preclu-\n\nsion rubric) requires identity of claims in two suits, how could the second\nsimilar suit have avoided standard claim preclusion in the first place?\nDifferent contexts may yield different answers. In a judgment-enforce-\nment context, the answer may be that claim preclusion applies only \u201cto\na final judgment rendered in an action separate from that in which the\ndoctrine is asserted.\u201d 18 J. Moore, D. Coquillette, G. Joseph, G. Vairo, &\nC. Varner, Federal Practice \u00a7131.31[1], p. 131\u2013116 (3d ed. 2019) (empha-\nsis added). Thus\u2014although claim preclusion does apply to a later,\nstandalone suit seeking relief that could have been obtained in the first\u2014\nit \u201cis not applicable to . . . efforts to obtain supplemental relief in the\noriginal action, or direct attacks on the judgment.\u201d Ibid (footnote de-\nleted). The upshot is that\u2014even if a court deems the underlying core of\noperative facts to be the same\u2014a plaintiff in that circumstance is not\nprecluded from enforcing its rights with respect to continuing wrongful\nconduct.\n\f12           LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained that the judgment in the first suit \u201cestablished\nconclusively the original validity of the securities described\nin the bill, and the liability of the town to pay them.\u201d Id.,\nat 623. In other words, by challenging the validity of all\nbonds of the same issue, the defense in the second suit\nwould have threatened the validity of the judgment in the\nfirst suit.

Argued January 13, 2020\u2014Decided May 14, 2020\nPetitioners (collectively Lucky Brand) and respondent (Marcel) both use\n  the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of their marks on jeans and other apparel.\n  Marcel received a trademark registration for the phrase \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d\n  and Lucky Brand uses the registered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and\n  other marks with the word \u201cLucky.\u201d This has led to nearly 20 years of\n  litigation, proceeding in three rounds. The first round resulted in a\n  2003 settlement agreement in which Lucky Brand agreed to stop using\n  the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and Marcel agreed to release any claims re-\n  garding Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own trademarks. In the second round\n  (2005 Action), Lucky Brand sued Marcel and its licensee for violating\n  its trademarks. Marcel filed several counterclaims turning, as rele-\n  vant here, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d but\n  it did not claim that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its own marks alone in-\n  fringed the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark. In both a motion to dismiss the coun-\n  terclaims and an answer to them, Lucky Brand argued that the coun-\n  terclaims were barred by the settlement agreement, but it did not\n  invoke that defense later in the proceedings. The court in the 2005\n  Action permanently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\n  Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark, and a jury found against Lucky Brand on\n  Marcel\u2019s remaining counterclaims. In the third round (2011 Action),\n  Marcel sued Lucky Brand for continuing to infringe the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d\n  mark, but it did not reprise its 2005 allegation about Lucky Brand\u2019s\n  use of the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase. After protracted litigation, Lucky\n  Brand moved to dismiss, arguing\u2014for the first time since early in the\n  2005 Action\u2014that Marcel had released its claims in the settlement\n  agreement. Marcel countered that Lucky Brand could not invoke the\n  release defense because it could have pursued that defense in the 2005\n\f2                LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                  MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                            Syllabus\n\n    Action but did not. The District Court granted Lucky Brand\u2019s motion\n    to dismiss. The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding that\n    \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d prohibited Lucky Brand from raising an unliti-\n    gated defense that it should have raised earlier.\nHeld: Because Marcel\u2019s 2011 Action challenged different conduct\u2014and\n raised different claims\u2014from the 2005 Action, Marcel cannot preclude\n Lucky Brand from raising new defenses. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (a) This case asks whether so-called \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d is a valid\n application of res judicata: a term comprising the doctrine of issue pre-\n clusion, which precludes a party from relitigating an issue actually de-\n cided in a prior action and necessary to the judgment, and the doctrine\n of claim preclusion, which prevents parties from raising issues that\n could have been raised and decided in a prior action. Any preclusion\n of defenses must, at a minimum, satisfy the strictures of issue preclu-\n sion or claim preclusion. See, e.g., Davis v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89486\"><a href=\"/opinion/89486/davis-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428.\n Here, issue preclusion does not apply, so the causes of action must\n share a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact[s]\u201d for claim preclusion to\n apply, Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a724, Comment b, p. 199.\n Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Because the two suits here involved different marks and differ-\n ent conduct occurring at different times, they did not share a \u201ccommon\n nucleus of operative facts.\u201d The 2005 claims depended on Lucky\n Brand\u2019s alleged use of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d But in the 2011 Action, Marcel\n alleged that the infringement was Lucky Brand\u2019s use of its other marks\n containing the word \u201cLucky,\u201d not any use of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d itself. The\n conduct in the 2011 Action also occurred after the conclusion of the\n 2005 Action. But claim preclusion generally \u201c \u2018does not bar claims that\n are predicated on events that postdate the filing of the initial com-\n plaint,\u2019 \u201d Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. ___, ___, be-\n cause events occurring after a plaintiff files suit often give rise to new\n \u201coperative facts\u201d creating a new claim to relief. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    (c) Marcel claims that treatises and this Court\u2019s cases support a ver-\n sion of \u201cdefense preclusion\u201d that extends to the facts of this case. But\n none of those authorities describe scenarios applicable here, and they\n are unlikely to stand for anything more than that traditional claim or\n issue preclusion principles may bar defenses raised in a subsequent\n suit\u2014principles that do not bar Lucky Brand\u2019s release defense here.\n Pp. 10\u201312.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, reversed and remanded.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\f                        Cite as: 590 U.

(Marcel). In the latest lawsuit between the two,\nLucky Brand asserted a defense against Marcel that it had\nnot pressed fully in a preceding suit between the parties.\nThis Court is asked to determine whether Lucky Brand\u2019s\nfailure to litigate the defense in the earlier suit barred\nLucky Brand from invoking it in the later suit. Because the\nparties agree that, at a minimum, the preclusion of such a\ndefense in this context requires that the two suits share the\nsame claim to relief\u2014and because we find that the two suits\nhere did not\u2014Lucky Brand was not barred from raising its\ndefense in the later action.\n                             I\n  Marcel and Lucky Brand both sell jeans and other ap-\nparel. Both entities also use the word \u201cLucky\u201d as part of\ntheir marks on clothing. In 1986, Marcel received a federal\ntrademark registration for \u201cGet Lucky\u201d; a few years later,\n\f2            LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n              MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin 1990, Lucky Brand began selling apparel using the reg-\nistered trademark \u201cLucky Brand\u201d and other marks that in-\nclude the word \u201cLucky.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (CA2 2015).\n   Three categories of marks are at issue in this case: Mar-\ncel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark; Lucky Brand\u2019s \u201cLucky Brand\u201d\nmark; and various other marks owned by Lucky Brand that\ncontain the word \u201cLucky.\u201d These trademarks have led to\nnearly 20 years of litigation between the two companies,\nproceeding in three rounds.\n                             A\n  In 2001\u2014the first round\u2014Marcel sued Lucky Brand, al-\nleging that Lucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d in\nadvertisements infringed Marcel\u2019s trademark.

Lucky Brand filed suit, alleging that\nMarcel and its licensee violated its trademarks by copying\nits designs and logos in a new clothing line. As relevant\nhere, Marcel filed several counterclaims that all turned, in\nlarge part, on Lucky Brand\u2019s alleged continued use of \u201cGet\nLucky\u201d: One batch of allegations asserted that Lucky Brand\nhad continued to use Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark in viola-\ntion of the settlement agreement, while others alleged that\nLucky Brand\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and \u201cLucky\nBrand\u201d together was \u201cconfusingly similar to\u201d\u2014and thus in-\nfringed\u2013\u2013Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

After the District Court denied the\nmotion without prejudice, Lucky Brand noted the release\ndefense once more in its answer to Marcel\u2019s counterclaims.\nBut as the 2005 Action proceeded, Lucky Brand never again\ninvoked the release defense.\n   The 2005 Action concluded in two phases. First, as a\nsanction for misconduct during discovery, the District\nCourt concluded that Lucky Brand violated the settlement\nagreement by continuing to use \u201cGet Lucky\u201d and perma-\nnently enjoined Lucky Brand from copying or imitating\nMarcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark.

See\nBrief for Respondent 52.\n                              C\n   In April 2011, the third round of litigation began: Marcel\nfiled an action against Lucky Brand (2011 Action), main-\ntaining that Lucky Brand continued to infringe Marcel\u2019s\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark and, in so doing, contravened the judg-\nment issued in the 2005 Action.\n   This complaint did not reprise Marcel\u2019s earlier allegation\n(in the 2005 Action) that Lucky Brand continued to use the\n\f4               LUCKY BRAND DUNGAREES, INC. v.\n                 MARCEL FASHIONS GROUP, INC.\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cGet Lucky\u201d phrase.

Indeed, while the judgment in the 2005\nAction plainly prohibited Lucky Brand from using \u201cGet\nLucky,\u201d it did not do the same with respect to Lucky Brand\u2019s\ncontinued, standalone use of its own marks containing the\nword \u201cLucky\u201d\u2014the only conduct at issue in the 2011 Action.\nPut simply, Lucky Brand\u2019s defense to new claims in the\n2011 Action did not risk impairing the 2005 judgment.\n  Nor do cases like Beloit v. Morgan, 7 Wall. 619 (1869), aid\nMarcel. See Brief for Respondent 32\u201333. To be sure, Beloit\nheld that a defendant in a second suit over bonds \u201cof the\nsame issue\u201d was precluded from raising a defense it had not\nraised in the first suit. 7 Wall., at 620. But the Court there\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 One might ask: If any preclusion of defenses (under the claim-preclu-\n\nsion rubric) requires identity of claims in two suits, how could the second\nsimilar suit have avoided standard claim preclusion in the first place?\nDifferent contexts may yield different answers. In a judgment-enforce-\nment context, the answer may be that claim preclusion applies only \u201cto\na final judgment rendered in an action separate from that in which the\ndoctrine is asserted.\u201d 18 J.

Argued January 14, 2020\u2014Decided May 7, 2020\nDuring former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s 2013 reelection\n campaign, his Deputy Chief of Staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, avidly\n courted Democratic mayors for their endorsements, but Fort Lee\u2019s\n mayor refused to back the Governor\u2019s campaign. Determined to pun-\n ish the mayor, Kelly, Port Authority Deputy Executive Director Wil-\n liam Baroni, and another Port Authority official, David Wildstein, de-\n cided to reduce from three to one the number of lanes long reserved at\n the George Washington Bridge\u2019s toll plaza for Fort Lee\u2019s morning com-\n muters. To disguise their efforts at political retribution, Wildstein de-\n vised a cover story: The lane realignment was for a traffic study. As\n part of that cover story, the defendants asked Port Authority traffic\n engineers to collect some numbers about the effect of the changes. At\n the suggestion of a Port Authority manager, they also agreed to pay an\n extra toll collector overtime so that Fort Lee\u2019s one remaining lane\n would not be shut down if the collector on duty needed a break. The\n lane realignment caused four days of gridlock in Fort Lee, and only\n ended when the Port Authority\u2019s Executive Director learned of the\n scheme. Baroni and Kelly were convicted in federal court of wire fraud,\n fraud on a federally funded program or entity (the Port Authority), and\n conspiracy to commit each of those crimes. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the scheme here did not aim to obtain money or property,\n Baroni and Kelly could not have violated the federal-program fraud or\n wire fraud laws.\n    The federal wire fraud statute makes it a crime to effect (with the\n use of the wires) \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining\n money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, repre-\n sentations, or promises.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71343. Similarly, the federal-\n\f2                       KELLY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    program fraud statute bars \u201cobtain[ing] by fraud\u201d the \u201cproperty\u201d (in-\n    cluding money) of a federally funded program or entity. \u00a7666(a)(1)(A).\n    These statutes are \u201climited in scope to the protection of property\n    rights,\u201d and do not authorize federal prosecutors to \u201cset[ ] standards of\n    disclosure and good government for local and state officials.\u201d McNally\n    v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 360. So under either provision, the\n    Government had to show not only that Baroni and Kelly engaged in\n    deception, but that an object of their fraud was money or property.\n    Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 26.\n       The Government argues that the scheme had the object of obtaining\n    the Port Authority\u2019s money or property in two ways. First, the Gov-\n    ernment claims that Baroni and Kelly sought to commandeer part of\n    the Bridge itself by taking control of its physical lanes. Second, the\n    Government asserts that the defendants aimed to deprive the Port Au-\n    thority of the costs of compensating the traffic engineers and back-up\n    toll collectors. For different reasons, neither of these theories can sus-\n    tain the verdicts.\n       Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s realignment of the access lanes was an exercise\n    of regulatory power\u2014a reallocation of the lanes between different\n    groups of drivers. This Court has already held that a scheme to alter\n    such a regulatory choice is not one to take the government\u2019s property.\n    Id., at 23. And while a government\u2019s right to its employees\u2019 time and\n    labor is a property interest, the prosecution must also show that it is\n    an \u201cobject of the fraud.\u201d Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349,\n    355. Here, the time and labor of the Port Authority employees were\n    just the implementation costs of the defendants\u2019 scheme to reallocate\n    the Bridge\u2019s lanes\u2014an incidental (even if foreseen) byproduct of their\n    regulatory object. Neither defendant sought to obtain the services that\n    the employees provided.

The cause was an unannounced\nrealignment of 12 toll lanes leading to the George Washing-\nton Bridge, an entryway into Manhattan administered by\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. For dec-\nades, three of those access lanes had been reserved during\nmorning rush hour for commuters coming from the streets\nof Fort Lee. But on these four days\u2014with predictable\nconsequences\u2014only a single lane was set aside. The public\nofficials who ordered that change claimed they were reduc-\ning the number of dedicated lanes to conduct a traffic study.\nIn fact, they did so for a political reason\u2014to punish the\nmayor of Fort Lee for refusing to support the New Jersey\nGovernor\u2019s reelection bid.\n  Exposure of their behavior led to the criminal convictions\nwe review here. The Government charged the responsible\nofficials under the federal statutes prohibiting wire fraud\nand fraud on a federally funded program or entity. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71343, 666(a)(1)(A). Both those laws target fraud-\nulent schemes for obtaining property. See \u00a71343 (barring\n\f2                 KELLY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfraudulent schemes \u201cfor obtaining money or property\u201d);\n\u00a7666(a)(1)(A) (making it a crime to \u201cobtain[ ] by fraud . . .\nproperty\u201d). The jury convicted the defendants, and the\nlower courts upheld the verdicts.\n   The question presented is whether the defendants com-\nmitted property fraud. The evidence the jury heard no\ndoubt shows wrongdoing\u2014deception, corruption, abuse of\npower. But the federal fraud statutes at issue do not crim-\ninalize all such conduct. Under settled precedent, the offi-\ncials could violate those laws only if an object of their dis-\nhonesty was to obtain the Port Authority\u2019s money or\nproperty. The Government contends it was, because the of-\nficials sought both to \u201ccommandeer\u201d the Bridge\u2019s access\nlanes and to divert the wage labor of the Port Authority em-\nployees used in that effort. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. We disa-\ngree. The realignment of the toll lanes was an exercise of\nregulatory power\u2014something this Court has already held\nfails to meet the statutes\u2019 property requirement. And the\nemployees\u2019 labor was just the incidental cost of that regula-\ntion, rather than itself an object of the officials\u2019 scheme. We\ntherefore reverse the convictions.\n                                I\n   The setting of this case is the George Washington Bridge.\nRunning between Fort Lee and Manhattan, it is the busiest\nmotor-vehicle bridge in the world. Twelve lanes with toll-\nbooths feed onto the Bridge\u2019s upper level from the Fort Lee\nside. Decades ago, the then-Governor of New Jersey com-\nmitted to a set allocation of those lanes for the morning\ncommute. And (save for the four days soon described) his\nplan has lasted to this day. Under the arrangement, nine\nof the lanes carry traffic coming from nearby highways.\nThe three remaining lanes, designated by a long line of traf-\nfic cones laid down each morning, serve only cars coming\nfrom Fort Lee.\n   The case\u2019s cast of characters are public officials who\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nworked at or with the Port Authority and had political ties\nto New Jersey\u2019s then-Governor Chris Christie. The Port\nAuthority is a bi-state agency that manages bridges, tun-\nnels, airports, and other transportation facilities in New\nYork and New Jersey. At the time relevant here, William\nBaroni was its Deputy Executive Director, an appointee of\nGovernor Christie and the highest ranking New Jersey of-\nficial in the agency. Together with the Executive Director\n(a New York appointee), he oversaw \u201call aspects of the Port\nAuthority\u2019s business,\u201d including operation of the George\nWashington Bridge. App. 21 (indictment). David Wildstein\n(who became the Government\u2019s star witness) functioned as\nBaroni\u2019s chief of staff. And Bridget Anne Kelly was a Dep-\nuty Chief of Staff to Governor Christie with special respon-\nsibility for managing his relations with local officials. She\noften worked hand-in-hand with Baroni and Wildstein to\ndeploy the Port Authority\u2019s resources in ways that would\nencourage mayors and other local figures to support the\nGovernor.\n   The fateful lane change arose out of one mayor\u2019s re-\nsistance to such blandishments. In 2013, Governor Christie\nwas up for reelection, and he wanted to notch a large, bi-\npartisan victory as he ramped up for a presidential cam-\npaign. On his behalf, Kelly avidly courted Democratic\nmayors for their endorsements\u2014among them, Mark\nSokolich of Fort Lee. As a result, that town received some\nvaluable benefits from the Port Authority, including an ex-\npensive shuttle-bus service. But that summer, Mayor\nSokolich informed Kelly\u2019s office that he would not back the\nGovernor\u2019s campaign. A frustrated Kelly reached out to\nWildstein for ideas on how to respond. He suggested that\ngetting rid of the dedicated Fort Lee lanes on the Bridge\u2019s\ntoll plaza would cause rush-hour traffic to back up onto lo-\ncal streets, leading to gridlock there. Kelly agreed to the\nidea in an admirably concise e-mail: \u201cTime for some traffic\nproblems in Fort Lee.\u201d App. 917 (trial exhibit). In a later\n\f4                 KELLY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nphone conversation, Kelly confirmed to Wildstein that she\nwanted to \u201ccreat[e] a traffic jam that would punish\u201d Mayor\nSokolich and \u201csend him a message.\u201d Id., at 254 (Wildstein\ntestimony). And after Wildstein relayed those communica-\ntions, Baroni gave the needed sign-off.\n   To complete the scheme, Wildstein then devised \u201ca cover\nstory\u201d\u2014that the lane change was part of a traffic study, in-\ntended to assess whether to retain the dedicated Fort Lee\nlanes in the future. Id., at 264. Wildstein, Baroni, and\nKelly all agreed to use that \u201cpublic policy\u201d justification\nwhen speaking with the media, local officials, and the Port\nAuthority\u2019s own employees. Id., at 265. And to give their\nstory credibility, Wildstein in fact told the Port Authority\u2019s\nengineers to collect \u201csome numbers on how[ ] far back the\ntraffic was delayed.\u201d Id., at 305. That inquiry bore little\nresemblance to the Port Authority\u2019s usual traffic studies.\nAccording to one engineer\u2019s trial testimony, the Port Au-\nthority never closes lanes to study traffic patterns, because\n\u201ccomputer-generated model[ing]\u201d can itself predict the ef-\nfect of such actions. Id., at 484 (testimony of Umang Patel);\nsee id., at 473\u2013474 (similar testimony of Victor Chung).\nAnd the information that the Port Authority\u2019s engineers\ncollected on this singular occasion was mostly \u201cnot useful\u201d\nand \u201cdiscarded.\u201d Id., at 484\u2013485 (Patel testimony). Nor did\nWildstein or Baroni show any interest in the data. They\nnever asked to review what the engineers had found; in-\ndeed, they learned of the results only weeks later, after a\njournalist filed a public-records request. So although the\nengineers spent valuable time assessing the lane change,\ntheir work was to no practical effect.\n   Baroni, Wildstein, and Kelly also agreed to incur another\ncost\u2014for extra toll collectors\u2014in pursuit of their object.\nWildstein\u2019s initial thought was to eliminate all three dedi-\ncated lanes by not laying down any traffic cones, thus turn-\ning the whole toll plaza into a free-for-all. But the Port Au-\nthority\u2019s chief engineer told him that without the cones\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthere would be a substantial risk of sideswipe crashes\u201d in-\nvolving cars coming into the area from different directions.\nId., at 284 (Wildstein testimony). So Wildstein went back\nto Baroni and Kelly and got their approval to keep one lane\nreserved for Fort Lee traffic. That solution, though, raised\nanother complication. Ordinarily, if a toll collector on a\nFort Lee lane has to take a break, he closes his booth, and\ndrivers use one of the other two lanes. Under the one-lane\nplan, of course, that would be impossible. So the Bridge\nmanager told Wildstein that to make the scheme work, \u201can\nextra toll collector\u201d would always have to be \u201con call\u201d to re-\nlieve the regular collector when he went on break. Id., at\n303. Once again, Wildstein took the news to Baroni and\nKelly. Baroni thought it was \u201cfunny,\u201d remarking that \u201conly\nat the Port Authority would [you] have to pay a toll collector\nto just sit there and wait.\u201d Ibid. Still, he and Kelly gave\nthe okay.\n   The plan was now ready, and on September 9 it went into\neffect. Without advance notice and on the (traffic-heavy)\nfirst day of school, Port Authority employees placed traffic\ncones two lanes further to the right than usual, restricting\ncars from Fort Lee to a single lane. Almost immediately,\nthe town\u2019s streets came to a standstill. According to the\nFort Lee Chief of Police, the traffic rivaled that of 9/11,\nwhen the George Washington Bridge had shut down.\nSchool buses stood in place for hours. An ambulance strug-\ngled to reach the victim of a heart attack; police had trouble\nresponding to a report of a missing child. Mayor Sokolich\ntried to reach Baroni, leaving a message that the call was\nabout an \u201curgent matter of public safety.\u201d Id., at 323. Yet\nBaroni failed to return that call or any other: He had agreed\nwith Wildstein and Kelly that they should all maintain \u201cra-\ndio silence.\u201d Id., at 270. A text from the Mayor to Baroni\nabout the locked-in school buses\u2014also unanswered\u2014went\naround the horn to Wildstein and Kelly. The last replied:\n\f6                 KELLY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cIs it wrong that I am smiling?\u201d Id., at 990 (Kelly text mes-\nsage). The three merrily kept the lane realignment in place\nfor another three days. It ended only when the Port Au-\nthority\u2019s Executive Director found out what had happened\nand reversed what he called their \u201cabusive decision.\u201d Id.,\nat 963 (e-mail of Patrick Foye).\n  The fallout from the scheme was swift and severe.\nBaroni, Kelly, and Wildstein all lost their jobs. More to the\npoint here, they all ran afoul of federal prosecutors.\nWildstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and agreed\nto cooperate with the Government. Baroni and Kelly went\nto trial on charges of wire fraud, fraud on a federally funded\nprogram or entity (the Port Authority), and conspiracy to\ncommit each of those crimes. The jury found both of them\nguilty on all counts. The Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit affirmed, rejecting Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s claim that\nthe evidence was insufficient to support their convictions.\nSee United States v. Baroni, 909 F. 3d 550, 560\u2013579 (2018).\nWe granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___ (2019).\n                              II\n  The Government in this case needed to prove property\nfraud. The federal wire fraud statute makes it a crime to\neffect (with use of the wires) \u201cany scheme or artifice to de-\nfraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false\nor fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71343. Construing that disjunctive language as a\nunitary whole, this Court has held that \u201cthe money-or-\nproperty requirement of the latter phrase\u201d also limits the\nformer. McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358\n(1987). The wire fraud statute thus prohibits only deceptive\n\u201cschemes to deprive [the victim of] money or property.\u201d Id.,\nat 356. Similarly, the federal-program fraud statute bars\n\u201cobtain[ing] by fraud\u201d the \u201cproperty\u201d (including money) of a\nfederally funded program or entity like the Port Authority.\n\u00a7666(a)(1)(A). So under either provision, the Government\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhad to show not only that Baroni and Kelly engaged in de-\nception, but that an \u201cobject of the[ir] fraud [was] \u2018property.\u2019 \u201d\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 26 (2000).1\n   That requirement, this Court has made clear, prevents\nthese statutes from criminalizing all acts of dishonesty by\nstate and local officials. Some decades ago, courts of ap-\npeals often construed the federal fraud laws to \u201cproscribe[]\nschemes to defraud citizens of their intangible rights to\nhonest and impartial government.\u201d McNally, 483 U. S., at\n355. This Court declined to go along. The fraud statutes,\nwe held in McNally, were \u201climited in scope to the protection\nof property rights.\u201d Id., at 360. They did not authorize fed-\neral prosecutors to \u201cset[ ] standards of disclosure and good\ngovernment for local and state officials.\u201d Ibid. Congress\nresponded to that decision by enacting a law barring fraud-\nulent schemes \u201cto deprive another of the intangible right of\nhonest services\u201d\u2014regardless of whether the scheme sought\nto divest the victim of any property. \u00a71346. But the vague-\nness of that language led this Court to adopt \u201ca limiting\nconstruction,\u201d confining the statute to schemes involving\nbribes or kickbacks. Skilling v. United States, 561 U. S.\n358, 405, 410 (2010). We specifically rejected a proposal to\nconstrue the statute as encompassing \u201cundisclosed self-\ndealing by a public official,\u201d even when he hid financial in-\nterests. Id., at 409. The upshot is that federal fraud law\nleaves much public corruption to the States (or their elec-\ntorates) to rectify. Cf. N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:30\u20132 (West\n2016) (prohibiting the unauthorized exercise of official func-\ntions). Save for bribes or kickbacks (not at issue here), a\nstate or local official\u2019s fraudulent schemes violate that law\nonly when, again, they are \u201cfor obtaining money or prop-\nerty.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71343; see \u00a7666(a)(1)(A) (similar).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The conspiracy verdicts raise no separate issue. None of the parties\n\ndoubts that those convictions stand or fall with the substantive offenses.\nIf there was property fraud here, there was also conspiracy to commit it.\nBut if not, not.\n\f8                 KELLY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government acknowledges this much, but thinks\nBaroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s convictions remain valid. According to\nthe Government\u2019s theory of the case, Baroni and Kelly \u201cused\na lie about a fictional traffic study\u201d to achieve their goal of\nreallocating the Bridge\u2019s toll lanes. Brief for United States\n43. The Government accepts that the lie itself\u2014i.e., that\nthe lane change was part of a traffic study, rather than po-\nlitical payback\u2014could not get the prosecution all the way\nhome. See id., at 43\u201344. As the Government recognizes,\nthe deceit must also have had the \u201cobject\u201d of obtaining the\nPort Authority\u2019s money or property. Id., at 44. The scheme\nmet that requirement, the Government argues, in two\nways. First, the Government claims that Baroni and Kelly\nsought to \u201ccommandeer[ ]\u201d part of the Bridge itself\u2014to \u201ctake\ncontrol\u201d of its \u201cphysical lanes.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 58\u201359. Sec-\nond, the Government asserts that the two defendants aimed\nto deprive the Port Authority of the costs of compensating\nthe traffic engineers and back-up toll collectors who per-\nformed work relating to the lane realignment. On either\ntheory, the Government insists, Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s\nscheme targeted \u201ca \u2018species of valuable right [or] interest\u2019\nthat constitutes \u2018property\u2019 under the fraud statutes.\u201d Brief\nfor United States 22 (quoting Pasquantino v. United States,\n544 U. S. 349, 356 (2005)).\n   We cannot agree. As we explain below, the Government\ncould not have proved\u2014on either of its theories, though for\ndifferent reasons\u2014that Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s scheme was\n\u201cdirected at the [Port Authority\u2019s] property.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 44. Baroni and Kelly indeed \u201cplotted to re-\nduce [Fort Lee\u2019s] lanes.\u201d Id., at 34. But that realignment\nwas a quintessential exercise of regulatory power. And this\nCourt has already held that a scheme to alter such a regu-\nlatory choice is not one to appropriate the government\u2019s\nproperty. See Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 23. By contrast, a\nscheme to usurp a public employee\u2019s paid time is one to take\nthe government\u2019s property. But Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s plan\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnever had that as an object. The use of Port Authority em-\nployees was incidental to\u2014the mere cost of implementing\u2014\nthe sought-after regulation of the Bridge\u2019s toll lanes.\n  Start with this Court\u2019s decision in Cleveland, which re-\nversed another set of federal fraud convictions based on the\ndistinction between property and regulatory power. The de-\nfendant there had engaged in a deceptive scheme to influ-\nence, to his own benefit, Louisiana\u2019s issuance of gaming li-\ncenses. The Government argued that his fraud aimed to\ndeprive the State of property by altering its licensing deci-\nsions. This Court rejected the claim. The State\u2019s \u201cintangi-\nble rights of allocation, exclusion, and control\u201d\u2014its prerog-\natives over who should get a benefit and who should not\u2014\ndo \u201cnot create a property interest.\u201d Ibid. Rather, the Court\nstated, those rights \u201camount to no more and no less than\u201d\nthe State\u2019s \u201csovereign power to regulate.\u201d Ibid.; see id., at\n20 (\u201c[T]he State\u2019s core concern\u201d in allocating gaming li-\ncenses \u201cis regulatory\u201d). Or said another way: The defend-\nant\u2019s fraud \u201cimplicate[d] the Government\u2019s role as sover-\neign\u201d wielding \u201ctraditional police powers\u201d\u2014not its role \u201cas\nproperty holder.\u201d Id., at 23\u201324. And so his conduct, how-\never deceitful, was not property fraud.\n  The same is true of the lane realignment. Through that\naction, Baroni and Kelly changed the traffic flow onto the\nGeorge Washington Bridge\u2019s tollbooth plaza. Contrary to\nthe Government\u2019s view, the two defendants did not \u201ccom-\nmandeer\u201d the Bridge\u2019s access lanes (supposing that word\nbears its normal meaning). They (of course) did not walk\naway with the lanes; nor did they take the lanes from the\nGovernment by converting them to a non-public use. Ra-\nther, Baroni and Kelly regulated use of the lanes, as offi-\ncials responsible for roadways so often do\u2014allocating lanes\nas between different groups of drivers. To borrow Cleve-\nland\u2019s words, Baroni and Kelly exercised the regulatory\nrights of \u201callocation, exclusion, and control\u201d\u2014deciding that\n\f10                    KELLY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndrivers from Fort Lee should get two fewer lanes while driv-\ners from nearby highways should get two more. They did\nso, according to all the Government\u2019s evidence, for bad rea-\nsons; and they did so by resorting to lies. But still, what\nthey did was alter a regulatory decision about the toll\nplaza\u2019s use\u2014in effect, about which drivers had a \u201clicense\u201d\nto use which lanes. And under Cleveland, that run-of-the-\nmine exercise of regulatory power cannot count as the tak-\ning of property.\n  A government\u2019s right to its employees\u2019 time and labor, by\ncontrast, can undergird a property fraud prosecution. Sup-\npose that a mayor uses deception to get \u201con-the-clock city\nworkers\u201d to renovate his daughter\u2019s new home. United\nStates v. Pabey, 664 F. 3d 1084, 1089 (CA7 2011). Or imag-\nine that a city parks commissioner induces his employees\ninto doing gardening work for political contributors. See\nUnited States v. Delano, 55 F. 3d 720, 723 (CA2 1995). As\nboth defendants agree, the cost of those employees\u2019 services\nwould qualify as an economic loss to a city, sufficient to\nmeet the federal fraud statutes\u2019 property requirement. See\nBrief for Respondent Baroni 27; Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. No less\nthan if the official took cash out of the city\u2019s bank account\nwould he have deprived the city of a \u201cvaluable entitlement.\u201d\nPasquantino, 544 U.

But\nnow consider the difficulty if the prosecution in Cleveland\nhad raised a similar employee-labor argument. As the Gov-\nernment noted at oral argument here, the fraud on Louisi-\nana\u2019s licensing system doubtless imposed costs calculable in\nemployee time: If nothing else, some state worker had to\nprocess each of the fraudster\u2019s falsified applications. But\nstill, the Government acknowledged, those costs were\n\u201c[i]ncidental.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 63. The object of the scheme\nwas never to get the employees\u2019 labor: It was to get gaming\nlicenses. So the labor costs could not sustain the conviction\nfor property fraud. See id., at 62\u201363.\n   This case is no different. The time and labor of Port Au-\nthority employees were just the implementation costs of the\ndefendants\u2019 scheme to reallocate the Bridge\u2019s access lanes.\nOr said another way, the labor costs were an incidental\n(even if foreseen) byproduct of Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s regula-\ntory object. Neither defendant sought to obtain the services\nthat the employees provided. The back-up toll collectors\u2014\nwhom Baroni joked would just \u201csit there and wait\u201d\u2014did\nnothing he or Kelly thought useful. App. 303; see supra, at\n5. Indeed, those workers came onto the scene only because\nthe Port Authority\u2019s chief engineer managed to restore one\nof Fort Lee\u2019s lanes to reduce the risk of traffic accidents.\nSee supra, at 5. In the defendants\u2019 original plan, which\nscrapped all reserved lanes, there was no reason for extra\ntoll collectors. And similarly, Baroni and Kelly did not hope\nto obtain the data that the traffic engineers spent their time\ncollecting. By the Government\u2019s own account, the traffic\nstudy the defendants used for a cover story was a \u201csham,\u201d\nand they never asked to see its results.

Even if so, it\nwould make no difference. Every regulatory decision (think\nagain of Cleveland, see supra, at 11) requires the use of\nsome employee labor. But that does not mean every scheme\nto alter a regulation has that labor as its object. Baroni\u2019s\nand Kelly\u2019s plan aimed to impede access from Fort Lee to\nthe George Washington Bridge. The cost of the employee\nhours spent on implementing that plan was its incidental\nbyproduct.\n  To rule otherwise would undercut this Court\u2019s oft-\nrepeated instruction: Federal prosecutors may not use\nproperty fraud statutes to \u201cset[ ] standards of disclosure and\ngood government for local and state officials.\u201d McNally, 483\nU. S., at 360; see supra, at 7. Much of governance involves\n(as it did here) regulatory choice. If U. S. Attorneys could\nprosecute as property fraud every lie a state or local official\ntells in making such a decision, the result would be\u2014as\nCleveland recognized\u2014\u201ca sweeping expansion of federal\ncriminal jurisdiction.\u201d 531 U. S., at 24. And if those prose-\ncutors could end-run Cleveland just by pointing to the reg-\nulation\u2019s incidental costs, the same ballooning of federal\npower would follow. In effect, the Federal Government\ncould use the criminal law to enforce (its view of ) integrity\nin broad swaths of state and local policymaking. The prop-\nerty fraud statutes do not countenance that outcome. They\ndo not \u201cproscribe[ ] schemes to defraud citizens of their in-\ntangible rights to honest and impartial government.\u201d\nMcNally, 483 U. S., at 355; see supra, at 7.

Argued January 14, 2020\u2014Decided May 7, 2020\nDuring former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s 2013 reelection\n campaign, his Deputy Chief of Staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, avidly\n courted Democratic mayors for their endorsements, but Fort Lee\u2019s\n mayor refused to back the Governor\u2019s campaign. Determined to pun-\n ish the mayor, Kelly, Port Authority Deputy Executive Director Wil-\n liam Baroni, and another Port Authority official, David Wildstein, de-\n cided to reduce from three to one the number of lanes long reserved at\n the George Washington Bridge\u2019s toll plaza for Fort Lee\u2019s morning com-\n muters. To disguise their efforts at political retribution, Wildstein de-\n vised a cover story: The lane realignment was for a traffic study. As\n part of that cover story, the defendants asked Port Authority traffic\n engineers to collect some numbers about the effect of the changes. At\n the suggestion of a Port Authority manager, they also agreed to pay an\n extra toll collector overtime so that Fort Lee\u2019s one remaining lane\n would not be shut down if the collector on duty needed a break. The\n lane realignment caused four days of gridlock in Fort Lee, and only\n ended when the Port Authority\u2019s Executive Director learned of the\n scheme. Baroni and Kelly were convicted in federal court of wire fraud,\n fraud on a federally funded program or entity (the Port Authority), and\n conspiracy to commit each of those crimes. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the scheme here did not aim to obtain money or property,\n Baroni and Kelly could not have violated the federal-program fraud or\n wire fraud laws.\n    The federal wire fraud statute makes it a crime to effect (with the\n use of the wires) \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining\n money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, repre-\n sentations, or promises.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71343.

The cause was an unannounced\nrealignment of 12 toll lanes leading to the George Washing-\nton Bridge, an entryway into Manhattan administered by\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. For dec-\nades, three of those access lanes had been reserved during\nmorning rush hour for commuters coming from the streets\nof Fort Lee. But on these four days\u2014with predictable\nconsequences\u2014only a single lane was set aside. The public\nofficials who ordered that change claimed they were reduc-\ning the number of dedicated lanes to conduct a traffic study.\nIn fact, they did so for a political reason\u2014to punish the\nmayor of Fort Lee for refusing to support the New Jersey\nGovernor\u2019s reelection bid.\n  Exposure of their behavior led to the criminal convictions\nwe review here. The Government charged the responsible\nofficials under the federal statutes prohibiting wire fraud\nand fraud on a federally funded program or entity. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7\u00a71343, 666(a)(1)(A). Both those laws target fraud-\nulent schemes for obtaining property. See \u00a71343 (barring\n\f2                 KELLY v.

The jury convicted the defendants, and the\nlower courts upheld the verdicts.\n   The question presented is whether the defendants com-\nmitted property fraud. The evidence the jury heard no\ndoubt shows wrongdoing\u2014deception, corruption, abuse of\npower. But the federal fraud statutes at issue do not crim-\ninalize all such conduct. Under settled precedent, the offi-\ncials could violate those laws only if an object of their dis-\nhonesty was to obtain the Port Authority\u2019s money or\nproperty. The Government contends it was, because the of-\nficials sought both to \u201ccommandeer\u201d the Bridge\u2019s access\nlanes and to divert the wage labor of the Port Authority em-\nployees used in that effort. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. We disa-\ngree. The realignment of the toll lanes was an exercise of\nregulatory power\u2014something this Court has already held\nfails to meet the statutes\u2019 property requirement. And the\nemployees\u2019 labor was just the incidental cost of that regula-\ntion, rather than itself an object of the officials\u2019 scheme. We\ntherefore reverse the convictions.\n                                I\n   The setting of this case is the George Washington Bridge.\nRunning between Fort Lee and Manhattan, it is the busiest\nmotor-vehicle bridge in the world. Twelve lanes with toll-\nbooths feed onto the Bridge\u2019s upper level from the Fort Lee\nside. Decades ago, the then-Governor of New Jersey com-\nmitted to a set allocation of those lanes for the morning\ncommute. And (save for the four days soon described) his\nplan has lasted to this day. Under the arrangement, nine\nof the lanes carry traffic coming from nearby highways.\nThe three remaining lanes, designated by a long line of traf-\nfic cones laid down each morning, serve only cars coming\nfrom Fort Lee.\n   The case\u2019s cast of characters are public officials who\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

The Port\nAuthority is a bi-state agency that manages bridges, tun-\nnels, airports, and other transportation facilities in New\nYork and New Jersey. At the time relevant here, William\nBaroni was its Deputy Executive Director, an appointee of\nGovernor Christie and the highest ranking New Jersey of-\nficial in the agency. Together with the Executive Director\n(a New York appointee), he oversaw \u201call aspects of the Port\nAuthority\u2019s business,\u201d including operation of the George\nWashington Bridge. App. 21 (indictment). David Wildstein\n(who became the Government\u2019s star witness) functioned as\nBaroni\u2019s chief of staff. And Bridget Anne Kelly was a Dep-\nuty Chief of Staff to Governor Christie with special respon-\nsibility for managing his relations with local officials. She\noften worked hand-in-hand with Baroni and Wildstein to\ndeploy the Port Authority\u2019s resources in ways that would\nencourage mayors and other local figures to support the\nGovernor.\n   The fateful lane change arose out of one mayor\u2019s re-\nsistance to such blandishments. In 2013, Governor Christie\nwas up for reelection, and he wanted to notch a large, bi-\npartisan victory as he ramped up for a presidential cam-\npaign. On his behalf, Kelly avidly courted Democratic\nmayors for their endorsements\u2014among them, Mark\nSokolich of Fort Lee. As a result, that town received some\nvaluable benefits from the Port Authority, including an ex-\npensive shuttle-bus service. But that summer, Mayor\nSokolich informed Kelly\u2019s office that he would not back the\nGovernor\u2019s campaign. A frustrated Kelly reached out to\nWildstein for ideas on how to respond. He suggested that\ngetting rid of the dedicated Fort Lee lanes on the Bridge\u2019s\ntoll plaza would cause rush-hour traffic to back up onto lo-\ncal streets, leading to gridlock there. Kelly agreed to the\nidea in an admirably concise e-mail: \u201cTime for some traffic\nproblems in Fort Lee.\u201d App. 917 (trial exhibit). In a later\n\f4                 KELLY v.

And after Wildstein relayed those communica-\ntions, Baroni gave the needed sign-off.\n   To complete the scheme, Wildstein then devised \u201ca cover\nstory\u201d\u2014that the lane change was part of a traffic study, in-\ntended to assess whether to retain the dedicated Fort Lee\nlanes in the future.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 264. </span><pre class=\"inline\">Wildstein, Baroni, and\nKelly all agreed to use that \u201cpublic policy\u201d justification\nwhen speaking with the media, local officials, and the Port\nAuthority\u2019s own employees.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 265. </span><pre class=\"inline\">And to give their\nstory credibility, Wildstein in fact told the Port Authority\u2019s\nengineers to collect \u201csome numbers on how[ ] far back the\ntraffic was delayed.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 305. </span><pre class=\"inline\">That inquiry bore little\nresemblance to the Port Authority\u2019s usual traffic studies.\nAccording to one engineer\u2019s trial testimony, the Port Au-\nthority never closes lanes to study traffic patterns, because\n\u201ccomputer-generated model[ing]\u201d can itself predict the ef-\nfect of such actions.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 484 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(testimony of Umang Patel);\nsee</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> at 473\u2013474 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(similar testimony of Victor Chung).\nAnd the information that the Port Authority\u2019s engineers\ncollected on this singular occasion was mostly \u201cnot useful\u201d\nand \u201cdiscarded.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 484</span><pre class=\"inline\">\u2013485 (Patel testimony). Nor did\nWildstein or Baroni show any interest in the data.

So although the\nengineers spent valuable time assessing the lane change,\ntheir work was to no practical effect.\n   Baroni, Wildstein, and Kelly also agreed to incur another\ncost\u2014for extra toll collectors\u2014in pursuit of their object.\nWildstein\u2019s initial thought was to eliminate all three dedi-\ncated lanes by not laying down any traffic cones, thus turn-\ning the whole toll plaza into a free-for-all.

So Wildstein went back\nto Baroni and Kelly and got their approval to keep one lane\nreserved for Fort Lee traffic. That solution, though, raised\nanother complication. Ordinarily, if a toll collector on a\nFort Lee lane has to take a break, he closes his booth, and\ndrivers use one of the other two lanes. Under the one-lane\nplan, of course, that would be impossible. So the Bridge\nmanager told Wildstein that to make the scheme work, \u201can\nextra toll collector\u201d would always have to be \u201con call\u201d to re-\nlieve the regular collector when he went on break.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at\n303. </span><pre class=\"inline\">Once again, Wildstein took the news to Baroni and\nKelly.

The use of Port Authority em-\nployees was incidental to\u2014the mere cost of implementing\u2014\nthe sought-after regulation of the Bridge\u2019s toll lanes.\n  Start with this Court\u2019s decision in Cleveland, which re-\nversed another set of federal fraud convictions based on the\ndistinction between property and regulatory power. The de-\nfendant there had engaged in a deceptive scheme to influ-\nence, to his own benefit, Louisiana\u2019s issuance of gaming li-\ncenses. The Government argued that his fraud aimed to\ndeprive the State of property by altering its licensing deci-\nsions. This Court rejected the claim.

Through that\naction, Baroni and Kelly changed the traffic flow onto the\nGeorge Washington Bridge\u2019s tollbooth plaza. Contrary to\nthe Government\u2019s view, the two defendants did not \u201ccom-\nmandeer\u201d the Bridge\u2019s access lanes (supposing that word\nbears its normal meaning). They (of course) did not walk\naway with the lanes; nor did they take the lanes from the\nGovernment by converting them to a non-public use. Ra-\nther, Baroni and Kelly regulated use of the lanes, as offi-\ncials responsible for roadways so often do\u2014allocating lanes\nas between different groups of drivers. To borrow Cleve-\nland\u2019s words, Baroni and Kelly exercised the regulatory\nrights of \u201callocation, exclusion, and control\u201d\u2014deciding that\n\f10                    KELLY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndrivers from Fort Lee should get two fewer lanes while driv-\ners from nearby highways should get two more. They did\nso, according to all the Government\u2019s evidence, for bad rea-\nsons; and they did so by resorting to lies. But still, what\nthey did was alter a regulatory decision about the toll\nplaza\u2019s use\u2014in effect, about which drivers had a \u201clicense\u201d\nto use which lanes. And under Cleveland, that run-of-the-\nmine exercise of regulatory power cannot count as the tak-\ning of property.\n  A government\u2019s right to its employees\u2019 time and labor, by\ncontrast, can undergird a property fraud prosecution.

But\nnow consider the difficulty if the prosecution in Cleveland\nhad raised a similar employee-labor argument.

SINENENG-SMITH\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 19\u201367. Argued February 25, 2020\u2014Decided May 7, 2020\nRespondent Evelyn Sineneng-Smith operated an immigration consulting\n  firm in San Jose, California. She assisted clients working without au-\n  thorization in the United States to file applications for a labor certifi-\n  cation program that once provided a path for aliens to adjust to lawful\n  permanent resident status. Sineneng-Smith knew that her clients\n  could not meet the long-passed statutory application-filing deadline,\n  but she nonetheless charged each client over $6,000, netting more than\n  $3.3 million.\n     Sineneng-Smith was indicted for multiple violations of 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) and (B)(i). Those provisions make it a federal felony\n  to \u201cencourag[e] or induc[e] an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the\n  United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such\n  coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law,\u201d\n  \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv), and impose an enhanced penalty if the crime is\n  \u201cdone for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial\n  gain,\u201d \u00a71324(a)(1)(B)(i). In the District Court, she urged that the pro-\n  visions did not cover her conduct, and if they did, they violated the\n  Petition and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment as applied.\n  The District Court rejected her arguments and she was convicted, as\n  relevant here, on two counts under \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) and (B)(i).\n     Sineneng-Smith essentially repeated the same arguments on appeal\n  to the Ninth Circuit. Again she asserted a right under the First\n  Amendment to file administrative applications on her clients\u2019 behalf,\n  and she argued that the statute could not constitutionally be applied\n  to her conduct. Instead of adjudicating the case presented by the par-\n  ties, however, the court named three amici and invited them to brief\n  and argue issues framed by the panel, including a question never\n  raised by Sineneng-Smith: Whether the statute is overbroad under the\n\f2               UNITED STATES v. SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    First Amendment. In accord with the amici\u2019s arguments, the Ninth\n    Circuit held that \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) is unconstitutionally overbroad.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit panel\u2019s drastic departure from the principle of\n party presentation constituted an abuse of discretion.\n    The Nation\u2019s adversarial adjudication system follows the principle\n of party presentation. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 243.\n \u201cIn both civil and criminal cases, . . . we rely on the parties to frame\n the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter\n of matters the parties present.\u201d Id., at 243.\n    That principle forecloses the controlling role the Ninth Circuit took\n on in this case. No extraordinary circumstances justified the panel\u2019s\n takeover of the appeal. Sineneng-Smith, represented by competent\n counsel, had raised a vagueness argument and First Amendment ar-\n guments homing in on her own conduct, not that of others. Electing\n not to address the party-presented controversy, the panel projected\n that \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) might cover a wide swath of protected speech,\n including abstract advocacy and legal advice. It did so even though\n Sineneng-Smith\u2019s counsel had presented a contrary theory of the case\n in her briefs and before the District Court. A court is not hidebound\n by counsel\u2019s precise arguments, but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s radical trans-\n formation of this case goes well beyond the pale. On remand, the case\n is to be reconsidered shorn of the overbreadth inquiry interjected by\n the appellate panel and bearing a fair resemblance to the case shaped\n by the parties.

S. C. \u00a71324, which makes it a\nfederal felony to \u201cencourag[e] or induc[e] an alien to come\nto, enter, or reside in the United States, knowing or in\nreckless disregard of the fact that such coming to,\nentry, or residence is or will be in violation of law.\u201d\n\u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv). The crime carries an enhanced penalty\nif \u201cdone for the purpose of commercial advantage or private\nfinancial gain.\u201d \u00a71324(a)(1)(B)(i).1\n   Respondent Evelyn Sineneng-Smith operated an immi-\ngration consulting firm in San Jose, California. She was\nindicted for multiple violations of \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) and\n(B)(i). Her clients, most of them from the Philippines,\nworked without authorization in the home health care\nindustry in the United States. Between 2001 and 2008,\nSineneng-Smith assisted her clients in applying for a \u201clabor\ncertification\u201d that once allowed certain aliens to adjust their\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For violations of 8 U.

SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident permitted to\nlive and work in the United States. \u00a71255(i)(1)(B)(ii).\n   There was a hindrance to the efficacy of Sineneng-\nSmith\u2019s advice and assistance. To qualify for the labor-\ncertification dispensation she promoted to her clients, an\nalien had to be in the United States on December 21, 2000,\nand apply for certification before April 30, 2001.\n\u00a71255(i)(1)(C). Sineneng-Smith knew her clients did not\nmeet the application-filing deadline; hence, their applica-\ntions could not put them on a path to lawful residence.2\nNevertheless, she charged each client $5,900 to file an ap-\nplication with the Department of Labor and another $900\nto file with the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nFor her services in this regard, she collected more than $3.3\nmillion from her unwitting clients.\n   In the District Court, Sineneng-Smith urged unsuccess-\nfully, inter alia, that the above-cited provisions, properly\nconstrued, did not cover her conduct, and if they did, they\nviolated the Petition and Free Speech Clauses of the First\nAmendment as applied. See Motion to Dismiss in No. 10\u2013\ncr\u2013414 (ND Cal.), pp. 7\u201313, 20\u201325; Motion for Judgt. of Ac-\nquittal in No. 10\u2013cr\u2013414 (ND Cal.), pp. 14\u201319, 20\u201325. She\nwas convicted on two counts under \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) and\n(B)(i), and on other counts (filing false tax returns and mail\nfraud) she does not now contest. Throughout the District\nCourt proceedings and on appeal, she was represented by\ncompetent counsel.\n   On appeal from the \u00a71324 convictions to the Ninth\nCircuit, both on brief and at oral argument, Sineneng-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Sineneng-Smith argued that labor-certification applications were\n\noften approved despite expiration of the statutory dispensation, and that\nan approved application, when submitted as part of a petition for adjust-\nment of status, would place her clients in line should Congress reactivate\nthe dispensation. See Motion for Judgt. of Acquittal in No. 10\u2013cr\u2013414\n(ND Cal.), p. 16.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSmith essentially repeated the arguments she earlier pre-\nsented to the District Court. See Brief for Appellant in\nNo. 15\u201310614 (CA9), pp. 11\u201328. The case was then moved\nby the appeals panel onto a different track. Instead of ad-\njudicating the case presented by the parties, the appeals\ncourt named three amici and invited them to brief and ar-\ngue issues framed by the panel, including a question\nSineneng-Smith herself never raised earlier: \u201c[W]hether\nthe statute of conviction is overbroad . . . under the First\nAmendment.\u201d App. 122\u2013124. In the ensuing do over of the\nappeal, counsel for the parties were assigned a secondary\nrole. The Ninth Circuit ultimately concluded, in accord\nwith the invited amici\u2019s arguments, that \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv)\nis unconstitutionally overbroad. 910 F. 3d 461, 485 (2018).\nThe Government petitioned for our review because the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals invalidated a federal stat-\nute. Pet. for Cert. 24. We granted the petition. 588 U. S.\n___ (2019).\n   As developed more completely hereinafter, we now hold\nthat the appeals panel departed so drastically from the\nprinciple of party presentation as to constitute an abuse of\ndiscretion. We therefore vacate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judg-\nment and remand the case for an adjudication of the appeal\nattuned to the case shaped by the parties rather than the\ncase designed by the appeals panel.\n                                 I\n    In our adversarial system of adjudication, we follow the\nprinciple of party presentation. As this Court stated in\nGreenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237 (2008), \u201cin both\ncivil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal\n. . . , we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision\nand assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters\nthe parties present.\u201d Id., at 243. In criminal cases, depar-\ntures from the party presentation principle have usually oc-\ncurred \u201cto protect a pro se litigant\u2019s rights.\u201d Id., at 244;\n\f4              UNITED STATES v. SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee, e.g., Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 381\u2013383\n(2003) (affirming courts\u2019 authority to recast pro se litigants\u2019\nmotions to \u201cavoid an unnecessary dismissal\u201d or \u201cinappropri-\nately stringent application of formal labeling requirements,\nor to create a better correspondence between the substance\nof a pro se motion\u2019s claim and its underlying legal basis\u201d (ci-\ntation omitted)). But as a general rule, our system \u201cis de-\nsigned around the premise that [parties represented by\ncompetent counsel] know what is best for them, and are re-\nsponsible for advancing the facts and argument entitling\nthem to relief.\u201d Id., at 386 (Scalia, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment).3\n   In short: \u201c[C]ourts are essentially passive instruments of\ngovernment.\u201d United States v. Samuels, 808 F. 2d 1298,\n1301 (CA8 1987) (Arnold, J., concurring in denial of reh\u2019g\nen banc)). They \u201cdo not, or should not, sally forth each day\nlooking for wrongs to right. [They] wait for cases to come to\n[them], and when [cases arise, courts] normally decide only\nquestions presented by the parties.\u201d Ibid.\n   The party presentation principle is supple, not ironclad.\nThere are no doubt circumstances in which a modest initi-\nating role for a court is appropriate. See, e.g., Day v.\nMcDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202 (2006) (federal court had\n\u201cauthority, on its own initiative,\u201d to correct a party\u2019s \u201cevi-\ndent miscalculation of the elapsed time under a statute [of\nlimitations]\u201d absent \u201cintelligent waiver\u201d).4 But this case\nscarcely fits that bill. To explain why that is so, we turn\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See Kaplan, Civil Procedure\u2014Reflections on the Comparison of Sys-\n\ntems, 9 Buffalo L. Rev. 409, 431\u2013432 (1960) (U.

None of them bear any resemblance to the redirection ordered by\nthe Ninth Circuit panel in this case.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst to the proceedings in the District Court.\n   In July 2010, a grand jury returned a multicount indict-\nment against Sineneng-Smith, including three counts of\nviolating \u00a71324, three counts of mail fraud in violation of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71341, and two counts of willfully subscribing to a\nfalse tax return in violation of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(1).\nSineneng-Smith pleaded guilty to the tax-fraud counts,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 78a\u201379a, and did not pursue on appeal\nthe two mail-fraud counts on which she was ultimately\nconvicted. We therefore concentrate this description on her\ndefenses against the \u00a71324 charges.\n   Before trial, Sineneng-Smith moved to dismiss the \u00a71324\ncounts. Motion to Dismiss in No. 10\u2013cr\u2013414 (ND Cal.). She\nasserted first that the conduct with which she was\ncharged\u2014advising and assisting aliens about labor certifi-\ncations\u2014is not proscribed by \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) and (B)(i).\nBeing hired to file lawful applications on behalf of aliens\nalready residing in the United States, she maintained, did\nnot \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201cinduce\u201d them to remain in this country.\nId., at 7\u201313. Next, she urged, alternatively, that clause (iv)\nis unconstitutionally vague and therefore did not provide\nfair notice that her conduct was prohibited, id., at 13\u201318, or\nshould rank as a content-based restraint on her speech, id.,\nat 22\u201324. She further asserted that she has a right safe-\nguarded to her by the Petition and Free Speech Clauses of\nthe First Amendment to file applications on her clients\u2019 be-\nhalf. Id., at 20\u201325. Nowhere did she so much as hint that\nthe statute is infirm, not because her own conduct is pro-\ntected, but because it trenches on the First Amendment\nsheltered expression of others.\n   The District Court denied the motion to dismiss,\nholding that Sineneng-Smith could \u201cencourag[e]\u201d nonciti-\nzens to remain in the country, within the meaning of\n\u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv), \u201c[b]y suggesting to [them] that the appli-\ncations she would make on their behalf, in exchange for\ntheir payments, would allow them to eventually obtain\n\f6              UNITED STATES v. SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlegal permanent residency in the United States.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 73a. The court also rejected Sineneng-Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional arguments, reasoning that she was prose-\ncuted, not for filing clients\u2019 applications, but for falsely rep-\nresenting to noncitizens that her efforts, for which she col-\nlected sizable fees, would enable them to gain lawful status.\nId., at 75a.\n   After a 12-day trial, the jury found Sineneng-Smith guilty\non the three \u00a71324 counts charged in the indictment, along\nwith the three mail-fraud counts. App. 118\u2013121. Sineneng-\nSmith then moved for a judgment of acquittal. She re-\nnewed, \u201calmost verbatim,\u201d the arguments made in her mo-\ntion to dismiss, App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, and the District\nCourt rejected those arguments \u201c[f ]or the same reasons as\nthe court expressed in its order denying Sineneng-Smith\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss,\u201d ibid. She simultaneously urged that the\nevidence did not support the verdicts. Motion for Judgt. of\nAcquittal in No. 10\u2013cr\u2013414 (ND Cal.), at 1\u201314. The District\nCourt found the evidence sufficient as to two of the three\n\u00a71324 counts and two of the three mail-fraud counts. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 67a.5\n   Sineneng-Smith\u2019s appeal to the Ninth Circuit from the\nDistrict Court\u2019s \u00a71324 convictions commenced unremarka-\nbly. On brief and at oral argument, she reasserted the self-\nregarding arguments twice rehearsed, initially in her mo-\ntion to dismiss, and later in her motion for acquittal.

Whether the statute of conviction is overbroad or\n    likely overbroad under the First Amendment, and if so,\n    whether any permissible limiting construction would\n    cure the First Amendment problem?\n       \u201c2. Whether the statute of conviction is void for\n    vagueness or likely void for vagueness, either under the\n    First Amendment or the Fifth Amendment, and if so,\n    whether any permissible limiting construction would\n    cure the constitutional vagueness problem?\n       \u201c3. Whether the statute of conviction contains an\n    implicit mens rea element which the Court should\n    enunciate. If so: (a) what should that mens rea element\n    be; and (b) would such a mens rea element cure any se-\n    rious constitutional problems the Court might deter-\n    mine existed?\u201d Ibid.\n   Counsel for the parties were permitted, but \u201cnot re-\nquired,\u201d to file supplemental briefs \u201climited to responding\nto any and all amicus/amici briefs.\u201d Id., at 123 (emphasis\nadded).

Of the\nthree specified areas of inquiry, the panel reached only the\nfirst, holding that \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) was facially overbroad\nunder the First Amendment, 910 F. 3d, at 483\u2013485, and\nwas not susceptible to a permissible limiting construction,\nid., at 472, 479.\n   True, in the redone appeal, Sineneng-Smith\u2019s counsel\n\f8               UNITED STATES v.

See Supplemental Brief for Appellant\nin No. 15\u201310614 (CA9), p. 1. How could she do otherwise?\nUnderstandably, she rode with an argument suggested by\nthe panel. In the panel\u2019s adjudication, her own arguments,\ndifferently directed, fell by the wayside, for they did not\nmesh with the panel\u2019s overbreadth theory of the case.\n                              II\n  No extraordinary circumstances justified the panel\u2019s\ntakeover of the appeal. Sineneng-Smith herself had raised\na vagueness argument and First Amendment arguments\nhoming in on her own conduct, not that of others. Electing\nnot to address the party-presented controversy, the panel\nprojected that \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) might cover a wide swath\nof protected speech, including political advocacy, legal ad-\nvice, even a grandmother\u2019s plea to her alien grandchild to\nremain in the United States. 910 F. 3d, at 483\u2013484.6 Nev-\nermind that Sineneng-Smith\u2019s counsel had presented a con-\ntrary theory of the case in the District Court, and that this\nCourt has repeatedly warned that \u201cinvalidation for [First\nAmendment] overbreadth is \u2018strong medicine\u2019 that is not to\nbe \u2018casually employed.\u2019 \u201d United States v.

S. C.\n\u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) is unconstitutionally overbroad. In my\nview, however, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision violates far\nmore than the party presentation rule. The merits of that\ndecision also highlight the troubling nature of this Court\u2019s\noverbreadth doctrine. That doctrine provides that \u201ca law\nmay be invalidated as overbroad if \u2018a substantial number of\nits applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to\nthe statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 \u201d United States v.\nStevens, 559 U. S. 460, 473 (2010) (quoting Washington\nState Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552\nU. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008)). Although I have previously\njoined the Court in applying this doctrine, I have since de-\nveloped doubts about its origins and application. It appears\nthat the overbreadth doctrine lacks any basis in the Consti-\ntution\u2019s text, violates the usual standard for facial chal-\nlenges, and contravenes traditional standing principles. I\nwould therefore consider revisiting this doctrine in an ap-\npropriate case.\n                              I\n  This Court\u2019s overbreadth jurisprudence is untethered\nfrom the text and history of the First Amendment. It first\n\f2            UNITED STATES v. SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nemerged in the mid-20th century. In Thornhill v. Alabama,\n310 U. S. 88 (1940), the Court determined that an antipick-\neting statute was \u201cinvalid on its face\u201d due to its \u201csweeping\nproscription of freedom of discussion,\u201d id., at 101\u2013105. The\nCourt rejected the State\u2019s argument that the statute was\nconstitutional because it was \u201climited or restricted in its ap-\nplication\u201d to proscribable \u201cviolence and breaches of the\npeace [that] are the concomitants of picketing.\u201d Id., at 105.\nWithout considering whether the defendant\u2019s actual con-\nduct was entitled to First Amendment protection, the Court\nconcluded that the law was unconstitutional because it\n\u201cd[id] not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area\nof state control but, on the contrary, swe[pt] within its am-\nbit other activities that in ordinary circumstances consti-\ntute an exercise of freedom of speech or of the press.\u201d Id.,\nat 97.\n   Since then, the Court has invoked this rationale to fa-\ncially invalidate a wide range of laws, from statutes enacted\nby Congress, see, e.g., Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535\nU. S. 234 (2002), to measures passed by city officials, see,\ne.g., Board of Airport Comm\u2019rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for\nJesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569 (1987). These laws covered a va-\nriety of subjects, from nudity in drive-in movies, Erznoznik\nv. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205 (1975), to charitable solicita-\ntions, Schaumburg v. Citizens for Better Environment, 444\nU. S. 620 (1980), to depictions of animal cruelty, Stevens,\nsupra, at 460. And all these laws were considered uncon-\nstitutional not because they necessarily violated an individ-\nual\u2019s First Amendment rights but \u201cbecause of a judicial pre-\ndiction or assumption that the statute\u2019s very existence may\ncause [some citizens] to refrain from constitutionally pro-\ntected [activity].\u201d Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601,\n612 (1973) (emphasis added); see also Erznoznik, supra, at\n216.\n   Notably, this Court has not attempted to ground its void-\nfor-overbreadth rule in the text or history of the First\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nAmendment. It did not do so in Thornhill, and it has not\ndone so since. Rather, the Court has justified this doctrine\nsolely by reference to policy considerations and value judg-\nments. See New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 768\u2013769\n(1982). It has stated that facially invalidating overbroad\nstatutes is sometimes necessary because \u201c[First Amend-\nment] freedoms are delicate and vulnerable, as well as su-\npremely precious in our society,\u201d and thus \u201cneed breathing\nspace to survive.\u201d* NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433\n(1963). And, in the context of the freedom of speech, the\nCourt has justified the overbreadth doctrine\u2019s departure\nfrom traditional principles of adjudication by noting free\nspeech\u2019s \u201ctranscendent value to all society, and not merely\nto those exercising their rights.\u201d Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380\nU. S. 479, 486 (1965).\n   In order to protect this \u201ctranscendent\u201d right, ibid., the\nCourt will deem a statute unconstitutional when, in \u201cthe\njudgment of this Court[,] the possible harm to society in per-\nmitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is out-\nweighed by the possibility that protected speech of others\nmay be muted and perceived grievances left to fester be-\ncause of the possible inhibitory effects of [the] statut[e].\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   *The Court often discusses the doctrine as applying in the context of\n\u201cFirst Amendment rights\u201d more generally. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\nU. S. 601, 611\u2013613 (1973); see also NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433\n(1963) (discussing \u201cthe First Amendment freedoms\u201d). Such arguments\nare typically raised in free speech cases, but the Court has occasionally\nentertained overbreadth challenges invoking the freedom of the press,\nsee, e.g., Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88 (1940), and the freedom of\nassociation, see, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of\nN. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967). Curiously, however, the Court has never ap-\nplied this doctrine in the context of the First Amendment\u2019s Religion\nClauses. In fact, the Court currently applies a far less protective stand-\nard to free exercise claims, upholding laws that substantially burden re-\nligious exercise so long as they are neutral and generally applicable. See\nEmployment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S.\n872 (1990). The Court has never acknowledged, much less explained,\nthis discrepancy.\n\f4           UNITED STATES v. SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nBroadrick, supra, at 612. In other words, the doctrine is\ndriven by a judicial determination of what serves the public\ngood. But there is \u201cno evidence [from the founding] in-\ndicat[ing] that the First Amendment empowered judges to\ndetermine whether particular restrictions of speech pro-\nmoted the general welfare.\u201d Campbell, Natural Rights and\nthe First Amendment, 127 Yale L. J. 246, 259 (2017). This\nmakes sense given that the Founders viewed value judg-\nments and policy considerations to be the work of legisla-\ntures, not unelected judges. See Obergefell v. Hodges, 576\nU. S. 644, 709 (2015) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Never-\ntheless, such judgments appear to be the very foundation\nupon which this Court\u2019s modern overbreadth doctrine was\nbuilt.\n   Perhaps unsurprisingly, the overbreadth doctrine shares\na close relationship with this Court\u2019s questionable vague-\nness doctrine. See Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. 591,\n611\u2013623 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). In\nfact, it appears that the Court\u2019s void-for-overbreadth rule\ndeveloped as a result of the vagueness doctrine\u2019s applica-\ntion in the First Amendment context. For example, this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Thornhill, which is recognized as \u201cthe\nfountainhead of the overbreadth doctrine,\u201d Monaghan,\nOverbreadth, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 11, cited a vagueness prec-\nedent in support of its overbreadth analysis. 310 U. S., at\n96 (citing Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 367\n(1931)). And the decision expressed concerns regarding the\nantipicketing statute\u2019s \u201cvague\u201d terms with \u201cno ascertaina-\nble meaning\u201d and their resulting potential for \u201cdiscrimina-\ntory enforcement.\u201d Thornhill, supra, at 97\u201398, 100\u2013101; cf.\nChicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 56 (1999) (opinion of Ste-\nvens, J.). As the overbreadth doctrine has developed, it has\n\u201calmost wholly merged\u201d with the vagueness doctrine as ap-\nplied to \u201cstatutes covering [F]irst [A]mendment activities.\u201d\nSargentich, Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doc-\ntrine, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 844, 873 (1970). Given the dubious\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Salerno,\n481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). But the overbreadth doctrine em-\npowers courts to hold statutes facially unconstitutional\neven when they can be validly applied in numerous circum-\nstances, including the very case before the court.\n   By lowering the bar for facial challenges in the First\nAmendment context, the overbreadth doctrine exacerbates\nthe many pitfalls of what is already a \u201cdisfavored\u201d method\nof adjudication. Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at\n450. \u201c[U]nder our constitutional system[,] courts are not\nroving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the va-\nlidity of the Nation\u2019s laws.\u201d Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 610\u2013\n611. But when a court entertains\u2014or in this case, seeks\nout\u2014an overbreadth challenge, it casts aside the \u201cjudicial\nrestraint\u201d necessary to avoid \u201c \u2018premature\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018unneces-\nsary pronouncement[s] on constitutional issues.\u2019 \u201d Wash-\nington State Grange, supra, at 450 (quoting United States\nv. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22 (1960)). This principle of re-\nstraint has long served as a fundamental limit on the scope\nof judicial power. See Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia\nS. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39\n(1885). \u201c[T]here is good evidence that courts [in the early\nRepublic] understood judicial review to consist [simply] \u2018of\na refusal to give a statute effect as operative law in resolv-\ning a case\u2019 \u201d once that statute was determined to be uncon-\nstitutional. Johnson, supra, at 615 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(quoting Walsh, Partial Unconstitutionality, 85 N. Y. U. L.\n\f6           UNITED STATES v. SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nRev. 738, 756 (2010)). Thus, our \u201cmodern practice of\nstrik[ing] down\u201d legislation as facially unconstitutional\nbears little resemblance to the practices of 18th and 19th\ncentury courts. Johnson, supra, at 615 (opinion of THOMAS,\nJ.) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mitchell,\nThe Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy, 104 Va. L. Rev. 933, 936\n(2018) (\u201c[F]ederal courts have no authority to erase a duly\nenacted law from the statute books\u201d).\n    Moreover, by relaxing the standard for facial challenges,\nthe overbreadth doctrine encourages \u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about\n\u201c \u2018imaginary\u2019 cases,\u201d Washington State Grange, supra, at\n450 (quoting Raines, supra, at 22), and \u201csummon[s] forth an\nendless stream of fanciful hypotheticals,\u201d United States v.\nWilliams, 553 U. S. 285, 301 (2008). And, when a court in-\nvalidates a statute based on its theoretical, illicit applica-\ntions at the expense of its real-world, lawful applications,\nthe court \u201cthreaten[s] to short circuit the democratic pro-\ncess by preventing laws embodying the will of the people\nfrom being implemented in a manner consistent with the\nConstitution.\u201d Washington State Grange, supra, at 451.\n    Collaterally, this Court has a tendency to lower the bar\nfor facial challenges when preferred rights are at stake.\nSee, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,\n505 U. S. 833 (1992).

This Court has long adhered to the rule that \u201ca liti-\ngant must assert his or her own legal rights and interests,\nand cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or inter-\nests of third parties.\u201d Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410\n(1991); see also Clark v. Kansas City, 176 U. S. 114, 118\n(1900); Owings v. Norwood\u2019s Lessee, 5 Cranch 344, 348\n(1809) (Marshall, C. J.). The Court has created a \u201climited\u201d\nexception to this rule, allowing third-party standing in cer-\ntain cases in which the litigant has \u201ca close relation to the\nthird-party\u201d and there is a substantial \u201chindrance to the\nthird party\u2019s ability to protect his or her own interests.\u201d\nPowers, supra, at 410\u2013411. Litigants raising overbreadth\nchallenges rarely satisfy either requirement, but the Court\nnevertheless allows third-party standing to \u201cavoi[d] making\nvindication of freedom of expression await the outcome of\nprotracted litigation.\u201d Dombrowski, 380 U. S., at 487. As I\nhave previously explained, this Court \u201chas no business cre-\nating ad hoc exceptions so that others can assert rights that\nseem especially important to vindicate.\u201d Whole Women\u2019s\nHealth, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at\n16).\n   The overbreadth doctrine\u2019s disregard for the general rule\nagainst third-party standing is especially problematic in\nlight of the rule\u2019s apparent roots in Article III\u2019s case-or-con-\ntroversy requirement. Although the modern Court has\ncharacterized the rule as a prudential rather than jurisdic-\ntional matter, see Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 193 (1976),\nit has never provided a substantive justification for that as-\nsertion. And the Court has admitted that this rule against\nthird-party standing is \u201cnot always clearly distinguished\nfrom the constitutional limitation[s]\u201d on standing, Barrows\nv. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 255 (1953); is \u201cclosely related to\nArt[icle] III concerns,\u201d Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500\n(1975); and even is \u201cgrounded in Art[icle] III limits on the\n\f8            UNITED STATES v. SINENENG-SMITH\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\njurisdiction of federal courts to actual cases and controver-\nsies,\u201d Ferber, 458 U. S., at 767, n. 20.\n    These statements find support in a historical under-\nstanding of Article III. To understand the scope of the Con-\nstitution\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement, \u201cwe must \u2018refer\ndirectly to the traditional, fundamental limitations upon\nthe powers of common-law courts.\u2019 \u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,\n578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op.,\nat 2) (quoting Honig v. Doe, 484 U. S. 305, 340 (1988)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting)). \u201cCommon-law courts imposed dif-\nferent limitations on a plaintiff \u2019s right to bring suit depend-\ning on the type of right the plaintiff sought to vindicate.\u201d\nSpokeo, 578 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op.,\nat 2). \u201cIn a suit for the violation of a private right, courts\nhistorically presumed that the plaintiff suffered a de facto\ninjury [if] his personal, legal rights [were] invaded.\u201d Ibid.\nPersonal constitutional rights, such as those protected un-\nder the First Amendment, are \u201cprivate rights\u201d in that they\n\u201c \u2018belon[g] to individuals, considered as individuals.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(quoting 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland *2); see also Ferber, supra, at 767 (recognizing \u201cthe\npersonal nature of constitutional rights\u201d as a \u201ccardinal prin-\ncipl[e] of our constitutional order\u201d); Hessick, Standing, In-\njury in Fact, and Private Rights, 93 Cornell L. Rev. 275, 287\n(2008) (listing \u201cFirst Amendment rights\u201d as examples of pri-\nvate rights provided by the Constitution). Thus, when a lit-\nigant challenges a statute on the grounds that it has vio-\nlated his First Amendment rights, he has alleged an injury\nsufficient to establish standing for his claim, regardless of\nthe attendant damages or other real-world harms he may\nor may not have suffered.\n    Overbreadth doctrine turns this traditional common-law\nrule on its head: It allows a litigant without a legal injury\nto assert the First Amendment rights of hypothetical third\nparties, so long as he has personally suffered a real-world\ninjury. See Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 612. In other words,\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

See Woolhandler & Nelson, Does History Defeat\nStanding Doctrine? 102 Mich. L. Rev. 689, 722\u2013723 (2004);\nsee also Hessick, 93 Cornell L. Rev., at 280\u2013281. At com-\nmon law, this sort of \u201cfactual harm without a legal injury\nwas damnum absque injuria and provided no basis for re-\nlief.\u201d Ibid. Courts adhered to the \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201cancient\nmaxim\u201d that one\u2019s real-world damages alone cannot \u201clay the\nfoundation of an action . . . if the act complained of does not\nviolate any of his legal rights.\u201d Parker v. Griswold, 17\nConn. *288, *302\u2013*303 (1846).\n   Here, the overbreadth challenge embraced by respondent\non appeal relied entirely on the free speech rights of\nothers\u2014immigration lawyers, activists, clergy, and even\ngrandmothers. This is not terribly surprising given that the\noverbreadth arguments were developed by amici organiza-\ntions that represent some of these third parties, not by re-\nspondent herself. See ante, at 7\u20138. Although it appears\nrespondent lacked standing on appeal to assert the rights\nof individuals not before the court, she did have standing to\nseek relief for alleged violations of her own constitutional\nrights, which she raised before the Ninth Circuit comman-\ndeered her appeal. On remand, the Court of Appeals will\nbe well within the bounds of its Article III jurisdiction in\nconsidering these narrower arguments.\n                          *    *    *\n   The overbreadth doctrine appears to be the handiwork of\njudges, based on the misguided \u201cnotion that some constitu-\ntional rights demand preferential treatment.\u201d Whole\nWoman\u2019s Health, 579 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 14). It seemingly lacks any basis in the text or\nhistory of the First Amendment, relaxes the traditional\nstandard for facial challenges, and violates Article III prin-\nciples regarding judicial power and standing.

Argued February 25, 2020\u2014Decided May 7, 2020\nRespondent Evelyn Sineneng-Smith operated an immigration consulting\n  firm in San Jose, California. She assisted clients working without au-\n  thorization in the United States to file applications for a labor certifi-\n  cation program that once provided a path for aliens to adjust to lawful\n  permanent resident status. Sineneng-Smith knew that her clients\n  could not meet the long-passed statutory application-filing deadline,\n  but she nonetheless charged each client over $6,000, netting more than\n  $3.3 million.\n     Sineneng-Smith was indicted for multiple violations of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n  \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) and (B)(i). Those provisions make it a federal felony\n  to \u201cencourag[e] or induc[e] an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the\n  United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such\n  coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law,\u201d\n  \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv), and impose an enhanced penalty if the crime is\n  \u201cdone for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial\n  gain,\u201d \u00a71324(a)(1)(B)(i). In the District Court, she urged that the pro-\n  visions did not cover her conduct, and if they did, they violated the\n  Petition and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment as applied.\n  The District Court rejected her arguments and she was convicted, as\n  relevant here, on two counts under \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) and (B)(i).\n     Sineneng-Smith essentially repeated the same arguments on appeal\n  to the Ninth Circuit. Again she asserted a right under the First\n  Amendment to file administrative applications on her clients\u2019 behalf,\n  and she argued that the statute could not constitutionally be applied\n  to her conduct. Instead of adjudicating the case presented by the par-\n  ties, however, the court named three amici and invited them to brief\n  and argue issues framed by the panel, including a question never\n  raised by Sineneng-Smith: Whether the statute is overbroad under the\n\f2               UNITED STATES v.

No extraordinary circumstances justified the panel\u2019s\n takeover of the appeal. Sineneng-Smith, represented by competent\n counsel, had raised a vagueness argument and First Amendment ar-\n guments homing in on her own conduct, not that of others. Electing\n not to address the party-presented controversy, the panel projected\n that \u00a71324(a)(1)(A)(iv) might cover a wide swath of protected speech,\n including abstract advocacy and legal advice. It did so even though\n Sineneng-Smith\u2019s counsel had presented a contrary theory of the case\n in her briefs and before the District Court. A court is not hidebound\n by counsel\u2019s precise arguments, but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s radical trans-\n formation of this case goes well beyond the pale.

To qualify for the labor-\ncertification dispensation she promoted to her clients, an\nalien had to be in the United States on December 21, 2000,\nand apply for certification before April 30, 2001.\n\u00a71255(i)(1)(C). Sineneng-Smith knew her clients did not\nmeet the application-filing deadline; hence, their applica-\ntions could not put them on a path to lawful residence.2\nNevertheless, she charged each client $5,900 to file an ap-\nplication with the Department of Labor and another $900\nto file with the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nFor her services in this regard, she collected more than $3.3\nmillion from her unwitting clients.\n   In the District Court, Sineneng-Smith urged unsuccess-\nfully, inter alia, that the above-cited provisions, properly\nconstrued, did not cover her conduct, and if they did, they\nviolated the Petition and Free Speech Clauses of the First\nAmendment as applied.

Curiously, however, the Court has never ap-\nplied this doctrine in the context of the First Amendment\u2019s Religion\nClauses. In fact, the Court currently applies a far less protective stand-\nard to free exercise claims, upholding laws that substantially burden re-\nligious exercise so long as they are neutral and generally applicable.

In other words, the doctrine is\ndriven by a judicial determination of what serves the public\ngood. But there is \u201cno evidence [from the founding] in-\ndicat[ing] that the First Amendment empowered judges to\ndetermine whether particular restrictions of speech pro-\nmoted the general welfare.\u201d Campbell, Natural Rights and\nthe First Amendment, 127 Yale L.

Never-\ntheless, such judgments appear to be the very foundation\nupon which this Court\u2019s modern overbreadth doctrine was\nbuilt.\n   Perhaps unsurprisingly, the overbreadth doctrine shares\na close relationship with this Court\u2019s questionable vague-\nness doctrine.

Argued December 2, 2019\u2014Decided April 27, 2020\nThe Copyright Act grants monopoly protection for \u201coriginal works of au-\n  thorship.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7102(a). Under the government edicts doctrine,\n  officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot be the au-\n  thors of the works they create in the course of their official duties.\n     The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the Official Code of Geor-\n  gia Annotated (OCGA). That Code includes the text of every Georgia\n  statute currently in force, as well as a set of non-binding annotations\n  that appear beneath each statutory provision. The annotations typi-\n  cally include summaries of judicial opinions construing each provision,\n  summaries of pertinent opinions of the state attorney general, and a\n  list of related law review articles and other reference materials. The\n  OCGA is assembled by the Code Revision Commission, a state entity\n  composed mostly of legislators, funded through legislative branch ap-\n  propriations, and staffed by the Office of Legislative Counsel.\n     The annotations in the current OCGA were produced by Matthew\n  Bender & Co., Inc., a division of the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a\n  work-for-hire agreement with the Commission. Under the agreement,\n  Lexis drafts the annotations under the supervision of the Commission,\n  which specifies what the annotations must include in exacting detail.\n  The agreement also states that any copyright in the OCGA vests in the\n  State of Georgia, acting through the Commission.\n     Respondent Public.Resource.Org (PRO), a nonprofit dedicated to fa-\n  cilitating public access to government records and legal materials,\n  posted the OCGA online and distributed copies to various organiza-\n  tions and Georgia officials. After sending PRO several cease-and-de-\n  sist letters, the Commission sued PRO for infringing its copyright in\n  the OCGA annotations. PRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory\n  judgment that the entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\n\f2             GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    public domain. The District Court sided with the Commission, holding\n    that the annotations were eligible for copyright protection because\n    they had not been enacted into law. The Eleventh Circuit reversed,\n    rejecting the Commission\u2019s copyright assertion under the government\n    edicts doctrine.\nHeld: The OCGA annotations are ineligible for copyright protection.\n Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The government edicts doctrine developed from a trio of 19th-\n century cases. In Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, the Court held that no\n reporter can have a copyright in the Court\u2019s opinions and that the Jus-\n tices cannot confer such a right on any reporter. In Banks v. Manches-\n ter, 128 U. S. 244, the Court held that judges could not assert copyright\n in \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity as judges\u201d\u2014be it \u201cthe\n opinion or decision, the statement of the case and the syllabus or the\n head note.\u201d Id., at 253. Finally, in Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617,\n the Court reiterated that an official reporter cannot hold a copyright\n interest in opinions created by judges. But, confronting an issue not\n addressed in Wheaton or Banks, the Court upheld the reporter\u2019s copy-\n right interest in several explanatory materials that the reporter had\n created himself because they came from an author who had no author-\n ity to speak with the force of law.\n    The animating principle behind the government edicts doctrine is\n that no one can own the law. The doctrine gives effect to that principle\n in the copyright context through construction of the statutory term\n \u201cauthor.\u201d For purposes of the Copyright Act, judges cannot be the \u201cau-\n thor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity\u201d as lawmak-\n ers. Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. Because legislators, like judges, have\n the authority to make law, it follows that they, too, cannot be \u201cau-\n thors.\u201d And, as with judges, the doctrine applies to whatever work\n legislators perform in their capacity as legislators, including explana-\n tory and procedural materials they create in the discharge of their leg-\n islative duties. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not copy-\n rightable. First, the author of the annotations qualifies as a legislator.\n Under the Copyright Act, the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the annotations is the\n Commission, 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b), which functions as an arm of the\n Georgia Legislature in producing the annotations. Second, the Com-\n mission creates the annotations in the discharge of its legislative du-\n ties. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (c) Georgia argues that excluding the OCGA annotations from copy-\n right protection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. First, it\n notes that \u00a7101 lists \u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible\n for copyright protection. That provision, however, refers only to \u201can-\n notations . . . which . . . represent an original work of authorship.\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (Emphasis added.) Georgia\u2019s annotations do not fit that description\n  because they are prepared by a legislative body that cannot be deemed\n  the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works it creates in its official capacity. Second,\n  Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact that the Act excludes\n  from copyright protection works prepared by Federal Government of-\n  ficials, without establishing a similar rule for State officials. \u00a7\u00a7101,\n  105. That rule, however, applies to all federal officials, regardless of\n  the nature and scope of their duties. It does not suggest an intent to\n  displace the much narrower government edicts doctrine with respect\n  to the States.\n     Moving on from the text, Georgia invokes what it views as the offi-\n  cial position of the Copyright Office, as reflected in the Compendium\n  of U. S. Copyright Office Practices. The Compendium, however, is a\n  non-binding administrative manual and is largely consistent with this\n  Court\u2019s position. Georgia also appeals to copyright policy, but such\n  requests should be addressed to Congress, not the courts.\n     Georgia attempts to frame the government edicts doctrine to focus\n  exclusively on whether a particular work has the force of law. But that\n  understanding cannot be squared with precedent\u2014especially Banks.\n  Moreover, Georgia\u2019s conception of the doctrine as distinguishing be-\n  tween different categories of content with different effects has less of\n  a textual footing than the traditional formulation, which focuses on the\n  identity of the author. Georgia\u2019s characterization of the OCGA anno-\n  tations as non-binding and non-authoritative undersells the practical\n  significance of the annotations to litigants and citizens. And its ap-\n  proach would logically permit States to hide all non-binding judicial\n  and legislative work product\u2014including dissents and legislative his-\n  tory\u2014behind a paywall.

S. C.\n\u00a7102(a). The question in this case is whether that protec-\ntion extends to the annotations contained in Georgia\u2019s\nofficial annotated code.\n   We hold that it does not. Over a century ago, we recog-\nnized a limitation on copyright protection for certain\ngovernment work product, rooted in the Copyright Act\u2019s\n\u201cauthorship\u201d requirement. Under what has been dubbed\nthe government edicts doctrine, officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law cannot be the authors of\u2014and\ntherefore cannot copyright\u2014the works they create in the\ncourse of their official duties.\n   We have previously applied that doctrine to hold that\nnon-binding, explanatory legal materials are not copyright-\nable when created by judges who possess the authority to\nmake and interpret the law. See Banks v. Manchester, 128\nU. S. 244 (1888). We now recognize that the same logic ap-\nplies to non-binding, explanatory legal materials created by\n\f2         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na legislative body vested with the authority to make law.\nBecause Georgia\u2019s annotations are authored by an arm\nof the legislature in the course of its legislative duties, the\ngovernment edicts doctrine puts them outside the reach of\ncopyright protection.\n                              I\n                              A\n   The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the \u201cOfficial\nCode of Georgia Annotated,\u201d or OCGA. The first page of\neach volume of the OCGA boasts the State\u2019s official seal and\nannounces to readers that it is \u201cPublished Under Authority\nof the State.\u201d\n   The OCGA includes the text of every Georgia statute\ncurrently in force, as well as various non-binding supple-\nmentary materials. At issue in this case is a set of annota-\ntions that appear beneath each statutory provision. The\nannotations generally include summaries of judicial deci-\nsions applying a given provision, summaries of any perti-\nnent opinions of the state attorney general, and a list of re-\nlated law review articles and similar reference materials.\nIn addition, the annotations often include editor\u2019s notes\nthat provide information about the origins of the statutory\ntext, such as whether it derives from a particular judicial\ndecision or resembles an older provision that has been con-\nstrued by Georgia courts. See, e.g., OCGA \u00a7\u00a751\u20131\u20131, 53\u20134\u2013\n2 (2019).\n   The OCGA is assembled by a state entity called the Code\nRevision Commission. In 1977, the Georgia Legislature\nestablished the Commission to recodify Georgia law for the\nfirst time in decades. The Commission was (and remains)\ntasked with consolidating disparate bills into a single Code\nfor reenactment by the legislature and contracting with a\nthird party to produce the annotations.

And it is staffed by the Office of Legislative Coun-\nsel, which is obligated by statute to provide services \u201cfor the\nlegislative branch of government.\u201d \u00a7\u00a728\u20134\u20133(c)(4), 28\u20139\u20134.\nUnder the Georgia Constitution, the Commission\u2019s role in\ncompiling the statutory text and accompanying annotations\nfalls \u201cwithin the sphere of legislative authority.\u201d Harrison\nCo. v. Code Revision Comm\u2019n, 244 Ga. 325, 330, 260 S. E.\n2d 30, 34 (1979).\n   Each year, the Commission submits its proposed statu-\ntory text and accompanying annotations to the legislature\nfor approval. The legislature then votes to do three things:\n(1) \u201cenact[ ]\u201d the \u201cstatutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws\u201d; (2) \u201cmerge[ ]\u201d the statutory portion \u201cwith\n[the] annotations\u201d; and (3) \u201cpublish[ ]\u201d the final merged\nproduct \u201cby authority of the state\u201d as \u201cthe \u2018Official Code\nof Georgia Annotated.\u2019 \u201d OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20131 (2019); see Code\nRevision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 906 F. 3d\n1229, 1245, 1255 (CA11 2018); Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\n   The annotations in the current OCGA were prepared in\nthe first instance by Matthew Bender & Co., Inc., a division\nof the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a work-for-hire agree-\nment with the Commission. The agreement between Lexis\nand the Commission states that any copyright in the OCGA\nvests exclusively in \u201cthe State of Georgia, acting through\nthe Commission.\u201d App. 567. Lexis and its army of research-\ners perform the lion\u2019s share of the work in drafting the an-\nnotations, but the Commission supervises that work and\nspecifies what the annotations must include in exacting de-\ntail. See 906 F. 3d, at 1243\u20131244; App. 269\u2013278, 286\u2013427\n(Commission specifications). Under the agreement, Lexis\nenjoys the exclusive right to publish, distribute, and sell the\nOCGA. In exchange, Lexis has agreed to limit the price it\nmay charge for the OCGA and to make an unannotated\n\f4         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nversion of the statutory text available to the public online\nfor free. A hard copy of the complete OCGA currently re-\ntails for $412.00.\n                               B\n   Public.Resource.Org (PRO) is a nonprofit organization\nthat aims to facilitate public access to government records\nand legal materials. Without permission, PRO posted a dig-\nital version of the OCGA on various websites, where it could\nbe downloaded by the public without charge. PRO also\ndistributed copies of the OCGA to various organizations\nand Georgia officials.\n   In response, the Commission sent PRO several cease-\nand-desist letters asserting that PRO\u2019s actions constituted\nunlawful copyright infringement. When PRO refused to\nhalt its distribution activities, the Commission sued PRO\non behalf of the Georgia Legislature and the State of Geor-\ngia for copyright infringement. The Commission limited its\nassertion of copyright to the annotations described above; it\ndid not claim copyright in the statutory text or numbering.\nPRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\npublic domain.\n   The District Court sided with the Commission. The\nCourt acknowledged that the annotations in the OCGA pre-\nsented \u201can unusual case because most official codes are not\nannotated and most annotated codes are not official.\u201d Code\nRevision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 244 F. Supp.\n3d 1350, 1356 (ND Ga. 2017). But, ultimately, the Court\nconcluded that the annotations were eligible for copyright\nprotection because they were \u201cnot enacted into law\u201d and\nlacked \u201cthe force of law.\u201d Ibid. In light of that conclusion,\nthe Court granted partial summary judgment to the Com-\nmission and entered a permanent injunction requiring PRO\nto cease its distribution activities and to remove the digital\ncopies of the OCGA from the internet.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Eleventh Circuit reversed. 906 F. 3d 1229. The\nCourt began by reviewing the three 19th-century cases in\nwhich we articulated the government edicts doctrine. See\nWheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834); Banks v. Manchester,\n128 U. S. 244 (1888); Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617\n(1888). The Court understood those cases to establish a\n\u201crule\u201d based on an interpretation of the statutory term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d that \u201cworks created by courts in the performance of\ntheir official duties did not belong to the judges\u201d but instead\nfell \u201cin the public domain.\u201d 906 F. 3d, at 1239. In the\nCourt\u2019s view, that rule \u201cderive[s] from first principles about\nthe nature of law in our democracy.\u201d Ibid. In a democracy,\nthe Court reasoned, \u201cthe People\u201d are \u201cthe constructive au-\nthors\u201d of the law, and judges and legislators are merely\n\u201cdraftsmen . . . exercising delegated authority.\u201d Ibid. The\nCourt therefore deemed the \u201cultimate inquiry\u201d to be\nwhether a work is \u201cattributable to the constructive author-\nship of the People.\u201d Id., at 1242. The Court identified three\nfactors to guide that inquiry: \u201cthe identity of the public offi-\ncial who created the work; the nature of the work; and the\nprocess by which the work was produced.\u201d Id., at 1254. The\nCourt found that each of those factors cut in favor of treat-\ning the OCGA annotations as government edicts authored\nby the People. It therefore rejected the Commission\u2019s asser-\ntion of copyright, vacated the injunction against PRO, and\ndirected that judgment be entered for PRO.\n   We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___ (2019).\n                             II\n  We hold that the annotations in Georgia\u2019s Official Code\nare ineligible for copyright protection, though for reasons\ndistinct from those relied on by the Court of Appeals. A\ncareful examination of our government edicts precedents\nreveals a straightforward rule based on the identity of the\nauthor. Under the government edicts doctrine, judges\u2014\nand, we now confirm, legislators\u2014may not be considered\n\f6         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe \u201cauthors\u201d of the works they produce in the course of\ntheir official duties as judges and legislators. That rule\napplies regardless of whether a given material carries the\nforce of law. And it applies to the annotations here because\nthey are authored by an arm of the legislature in the course\nof its official duties.\n                               A\n   We begin with precedent. The government edicts doc-\ntrine traces back to a trio of cases decided in the 19th cen-\ntury. In this Court\u2019s first copyright case, Wheaton v. Peters,\n8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court\u2019s third Reporter of Decisions,\nWheaton, sued the fourth, Peters, unsuccessfully asserting\na copyright interest in the Justices\u2019 opinions. Id., at 617\n(argument). In Wheaton\u2019s view, the opinions \u201cmust have\nbelonged to some one\u201d because \u201cthey were new, original,\u201d\nand much more \u201celaborate\u201d than law or custom required.\nId., at 615. Wheaton argued that the Justices were the au-\nthors and had assigned their ownership interests to him\nthrough a tacit \u201cgift.\u201d Id., at 614. The Court unanimously\nrejected that argument, concluding that \u201cno reporter has or\ncan have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by\nthis court\u201d and that \u201cthe judges thereof cannot confer on\nany reporter any such right.\u201d Id., at 668 (opinion).\n   That conclusion apparently seemed too obvious to adorn\nwith further explanation, but the Court provided one a half\ncentury later in Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244 (1888).\nThat case concerned whether Wheaton\u2019s state-court coun-\nterpart, the official reporter of the Ohio Supreme Court,\nheld a copyright in the judges\u2019 opinions and several non-\nbinding explanatory materials prepared by the judges. Id.,\nat 249\u2013251. The Court concluded that he did not, explain-\ning that \u201cthe judge who, in his judicial capacity, prepares\nthe opinion or decision, the statement of the case and the\nsyllabus or head note\u201d cannot \u201cbe regarded as their author\nor their proprietor, in the sense of [the Copyright Act].\u201d Id.,\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 253. Pursuant to \u201ca judicial consensus\u201d dating back to\nWheaton, judges could not assert copyright in \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as judges.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S, at 253 (emphasis in original). Rather, \u201c[t]he whole\nwork done by the judges constitutes the authentic exposi-\ntion and interpretation of the law, which, binding every\ncitizen, is free for publication to all.\u201d Ibid. (citing Nash v.\nLathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 6 N. E. 559 (1886)).\n   In a companion case decided later that Term, Callaghan\nv. Myers, 128 U. S. 617 (1888), the Court identified an im-\nportant limiting principle. As in Wheaton and Banks,\nthe Court rejected the claim that an official reporter held a\ncopyright interest in the judges\u2019 opinions. But, resolving an\nissue not addressed in Wheaton and Banks, the Court up-\nheld the reporter\u2019s copyright interest in several explanatory\nmaterials that the reporter had created himself: headnotes,\nsyllabi, tables of contents, and the like. Callaghan, 128\nU. S., at 645, 647. Although these works mirrored the\njudge-made materials rejected in Banks, they came from an\nauthor who had no authority to speak with the force of law.\nBecause the reporter was not a judge, he was free to \u201cob-\ntain[ ] a copyright\u201d for the materials that were \u201cthe result\nof his [own] intellectual labor.\u201d 128 U. S., at 647.\n   These cases establish a straightforward rule: Because\njudges are vested with the authority to make and interpret\nthe law, they cannot be the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works they pre-\npare \u201cin the discharge of their judicial duties.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S., at 253. This rule applies both to binding works (such\nas opinions) and to non-binding works (such as headnotes\nand syllabi). Ibid. It does not apply, however, to works cre-\nated by government officials (or private parties) who lack\nthe authority to make or interpret the law, such as court\nreporters. Compare ibid. with Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 647.\n   The animating principle behind this rule is that no one\ncan own the law. \u201cEvery citizen is presumed to know the\nlaw,\u201d and \u201cit needs no argument to show . . . that all should\n\f8           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhave free access\u201d to its contents. Nash, 142 Mass., at 35, 6\nN. E., at 560 (cited by Banks, 128 U. S., at 253\u2013254). Our\ncases give effect to that principle in the copyright context\nthrough construction of the statutory term \u201cauthor.\u201d Id., at\n253.1 Rather than attempting to catalog the materials\nthat constitute \u201cthe law,\u201d the doctrine bars the officials\nresponsible for creating the law from being considered the\n\u201cauthor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capac-\nity\u201d as lawmakers. Ibid. (emphasis added). Because these\nofficials are generally empowered to make and interpret\nlaw, their \u201cwhole work\u201d is deemed part of the \u201cauthentic ex-\nposition and interpretation of the law\u201d and must be \u201cfree for\npublication to all.\u201d Ibid.\n   If judges, acting as judges, cannot be \u201cauthors\u201d because of\ntheir authority to make and interpret the law, it follows\nthat legislators, acting as legislators, cannot be either.\nCourts have thus long understood the government edicts\ndoctrine to apply to legislative materials. See, e.g., Nash,\n142 Mass., at 35, 6 N. E., at 560 (judicial opinions and stat-\nutes stand \u201con substantially the same footing\u201d for purposes\nof the government edicts doctrine); Howell v. Miller, 91 F.\n129, 130\u2013131, 137\u2013138 (CA6 1898) (Harlan, J., Circuit Jus-\ntice, joined by then-Circuit Judge Taft) (analyzing statutes\nand supplementary materials under Banks and Callaghan\nand concluding that the materials were copyrightable be-\ncause they were prepared by a private compiler).\n   Moreover, just as the doctrine applies to \u201cwhatever work\n[judges] perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d Banks, 128\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Copyright Act of 1790 granted copyright protection to \u201cthe author\n\nand authors\u201d of qualifying works. Act of May 31, 1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 124.\nThis author requirement appears in the current Copyright Act at\n\u00a7102(a), which limits protection to \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d 17\nU. S. C. \u00a7102(a) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7201(a) (copyright \u201cvests ini-\ntially in the author or authors of the work\u201d).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 253, it applies to whatever work legislators per-\nform in their capacity as legislators. That of course includes\nfinal legislation, but it also includes explanatory and proce-\ndural materials legislators create in the discharge of their\nlegislative duties. In the same way that judges cannot be\nthe authors of their headnotes and syllabi, legislators can-\nnot be the authors of (for example) their floor statements,\ncommittee reports, and proposed bills. These materials are\npart of the \u201cwhole work done by [legislators],\u201d so they must\nbe \u201cfree for publication to all.\u201d Ibid.\n   Under our precedents, therefore, copyright does not vest\nin works that are (1) created by judges and legislators (2) in\nthe course of their judicial and legislative duties.\n                              B\n                              1\n   Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not\ncopyrightable. The first step is to examine whether their\npurported author qualifies as a legislator.\n   As we have explained, the annotations were prepared in\nthe first instance by a private company (Lexis) pursuant to\na work-for-hire agreement with Georgia\u2019s Code Revision\nCommission. The Copyright Act therefore deems the Com-\nmission the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the work. 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b).\nAlthough Lexis expends considerable effort preparing the\nannotations, for purposes of copyright that labor redounds\nto the Commission as the statutory author. Georgia agrees\nthat the author is the Commission. Brief for Petitioners 25.\n   The Commission is not identical to the Georgia Legisla-\nture, but functions as an arm of it for the purpose of produc-\ning the annotations. The Commission is created by the leg-\nislature, for the legislature, and consists largely of\nlegislators. The Commission receives funding and staff des-\nignated by law for the legislative branch. Significantly, the\nannotations the Commission creates are approved by the\nlegislature before being \u201cmerged\u201d with the statutory text\n\f10           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand published in the official code alongside that text at the\nlegislature\u2019s direction. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20131; see 906 F. 3d, at\n1245, 1255; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\n   If there were any doubt about the link between the Com-\nmission and the legislature, the Georgia Supreme Court\nhas dispelled it by holding that, under the Georgia Consti-\ntution, \u201cthe work of the Commission; i.e., selecting a pub-\nlisher and contracting for and supervising the codification\nof the laws enacted by the General Assembly, including\ncourt interpretations thereof, is within the sphere of legisla-\ntive authority.\u201d Harrison Co., 244 Ga., at 330, 260 S. E. 2d,\nat 34 (emphasis added). That holding is not limited to the\nCommission\u2019s role in codifying the statutory text. The Com-\nmission\u2019s \u201clegislative authority\u201d specifically includes its\n\u201ccodification of . . . court interpretations\u201d of the State\u2019s laws.\nIbid. Thus, as a matter of state law, the Commission wields\nthe legislature\u2019s authority when it works with Lexis to pro-\nduce the annotations. All of this shows that the Commis-\nsion serves as an extension of the Georgia Legislature in\npreparing and publishing the annotations. And it helps\nexplain why the Commission brought this suit asserting\ncopyright in the annotations \u201con behalf of and for the\nbenefit of \u201d the Georgia Legislature and the State of\nGeorgia. App. 20.2\n                             2\n  The second step is to determine whether the Commission\ncreates the annotations in the \u201cdischarge\u201d of its legislative\n\u201cduties.\u201d Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. It does. Although the\nannotations are not enacted into law through bicameralism\nand presentment, the Commission\u2019s preparation of the an-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE THOMAS does not dispute that the Commission is an exten-\n\nsion of the legislature; he instead faults us for highlighting the multiple\nfeatures of the Commission that make clear that this is so. See post, at\n16 (dissenting opinion).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotations is under Georgia law an act of \u201clegislative author-\nity,\u201d Harrison Co., 244 Ga., at 330, 260 S. E. 2d, at 34, and\nthe annotations provide commentary and resources that the\nlegislature has deemed relevant to understanding its laws.\nGeorgia and JUSTICE GINSBURG emphasize that the anno-\ntations do not purport to provide authoritative explanations\nof the law and largely summarize other materials, such as\njudicial decisions and law review articles. See post, at 3\u20134\n(dissenting opinion). But that does not take them outside\nthe exercise of legislative duty by the Commission and leg-\nislature. Just as we have held that the \u201cstatement of the\ncase and the syllabus or head note\u201d prepared by judges fall\nwithin the \u201cwork they perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d\nBanks, 128 U. S., at 253, so too annotations published by\nlegislators alongside the statutory text fall within the work\nlegislators perform in their capacity as legislators.\n   In light of the Commission\u2019s role as an adjunct to the leg-\nislature and the fact that the Commission authors the\nannotations in the course of its legislative responsibilities,\nthe annotations in Georgia\u2019s Official Code fall within the\ngovernment edicts doctrine and are not copyrightable.\n                               III\n   Georgia resists this conclusion on several grounds. At the\noutset, Georgia advances two arguments for why, in its\nview, excluding the OCGA annotations from copyright\nprotection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. Both\nare unavailing.\n   First, Georgia notes that \u00a7101 of the Act specifically lists\n\u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible for copy-\nright protection. But that provision refers only to \u201cannota-\ntions . . . which . . . represent an original work of author-\nship.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7101 (emphasis added). The whole point\nof the government edicts doctrine is that judges and legis-\nlators cannot serve as authors when they produce works in\ntheir official capacity. While the reference to \u201cannotations\u201d\n\f12        GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin \u00a7101 may help explain why supplemental, explanatory\nmaterials are copyrightable when prepared by a private\nparty, or a non-lawmaking official like the reporter in Cal-\nlaghan, it does not speak to whether those same materials\nare copyrightable when prepared by a judge or a legislator.\nIn the same way that judicial materials are ineligible for\nprotection even though they plainly qualify as \u201c[l]iterary\nworks . . . expressed in words,\u201d ibid., legislative materials\nare ineligible for protection even if they happen to fit the\ndescription of otherwise copyrightable \u201cannotations.\u201d\n  Second, Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact\nthat the Act excludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s]\nprepared by an officer or employee of the United States\nGovernment as part of that person\u2019s official duties\u201d and\ndoes not establish a similar rule for the States. \u00a7101; see\nalso \u00a7105. But the bar on copyright protection for federal\nworks sweeps much more broadly than the government\nedicts doctrine does. That bar applies to works created by\nall federal \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s],\u201d without regard for the\nnature of their position or scope of their authority. What-\never policy reasons might justify the Federal Government\u2019s\ndecision to forfeit copyright protection for its own proprie-\ntary works, that federal rule does not suggest an intent to\ndisplace the much narrower government edicts doctrine\nwith respect to the States. That doctrine does not apply to\nnon-lawmaking officials, leaving States free to assert copy-\nright in the vast majority of expressive works they produce,\nsuch as those created by their universities, libraries,\ntourism offices, and so on.\n  More generally, Georgia suggests that we should resist\napplying our government edicts precedents to the OCGA\nannotations because our 19th-century forebears inter-\npreted the statutory term author by reference to \u201cpublic\npolicy\u201d\u2014an approach that Georgia believes is incongruous\nwith the \u201cmodern era\u201d of statutory interpretation.

The same study cited by JUSTICE THOMAS to support a practice\nof claiming copyright in non-binding annotations also reports that \u201cmany\nstates claim copyright interest in their primary law materials,\u201d including\nstatutes and regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of Copyrights in\nPrimary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertainment L. J. 81, 109\n(2000) (emphasis added). JUSTICE THOMAS concedes that such assertions\nare plainly foreclosed by our government edicts precedents. Post, at 4.\nThat interested parties have pursued ambitious readings of our prece-\ndents does not mean those precedents are incapable of providing mean-\ningful guidance to us or to Congress.\n\f14         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nmerits deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S.\n134 (1944). That means we must follow it only to the extent\nit has the \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d Id., at 140. Because our\nprecedents answer the question before us, we find any com-\npeting guidance in the Compendium unpersuasive.\n   In any event, the Compendium is largely consistent with\nour decision. Drawing on Banks, it states that, \u201c[a]s a mat-\nter of longstanding public policy, the U. S. Copyright Office\nwill not register a government edict that has been issued by\nany state, local, or territorial government, including legis-\nlative enactments, judicial decisions, administrative rul-\nings, public ordinances, or similar types of official legal ma-\nterials.\u201d Compendium \u00a7313.6(C)(2) (rev. 3d ed. 2017)\n(emphasis added). And, under Banks, what counts as a\n\u201csimilar\u201d material depends on what kind of officer created\nthe material (i.e., a judge) and whether the officer created\nit in the course of official (i.e., judicial) duties. See Compen-\ndium \u00a7313.6(C)(2) (quoting Banks, 128 U. S., at 253, for the\nproposition that copyright cannot vest \u201cin the products of\nthe labor done by judicial officers in the discharge of their\njudicial duties\u201d).\n   The Compendium goes on to observe that \u201cthe Office may\nregister annotations that summarize or comment upon\nlegal materials . . . unless the annotations themselves have\nthe force of law.\u201d Compendium \u00a7313.6(C)(2). But that\nbroad statement\u2014true of annotations created by officials\nsuch as court reporters that lack the authority to make or\ninterpret the law\u2014does not engage with the critical issue of\nannotations created by judges or legislators in their official\ncapacities. Because the Compendium does not address that\nquestion and otherwise echoes our government edicts prec-\nedents, it is of little relevance here.\n   Georgia also appeals to the overall purpose of the Copy-\nright Act to promote the creation and dissemination of\ncreative works. Georgia submits that, without copyright\nprotection, Georgia and many other States will be unable to\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

That\nappeal to copyright policy, however, is addressed to the\nwrong forum. As Georgia acknowledges, \u201c[I]t is generally\nfor Congress, not the courts, to decide how best to pursue\nthe Copyright Clause\u2019s objectives.\u201d Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537\nU. S. 186, 212 (2003). And that principle requires adher-\nence to precedent when, as here, we have construed the\nstatutory text and \u201ctossed [the ball] into Congress\u2019s court,\nfor acceptance or not as that branch elects.\u201d Kimble, 576\nU. S., at 456.\n   Turning to our government edicts precedents, Georgia in-\nsists that they can and should be read to focus exclusively\non whether a particular work has \u201cthe force of law.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 32 (capitalization deleted). JUSTICE THOMAS\nappears to endorse the same view. See post, at 4. But that\nframing has multiple flaws.\n   Most obviously, it cannot be squared with the reasoning\nor results of our cases\u2014especially Banks. Banks, following\nWheaton and the \u201cjudicial consensus\u201d it inspired, denied\ncopyright protection to judicial opinions without excepting\nconcurrences and dissents that carry no legal force. 128\nU. S., at 253 (emphasis deleted). As every judge learns the\nhard way, \u201ccomments in [a] dissenting opinion\u201d about legal\nprinciples and precedents \u201care just that: comments in a dis-\nsenting opinion.\u201d Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449\nU. S. 166, 177, n. 10 (1980). Yet such comments are covered\nby the government edicts doctrine because they come from\nan official with authority to make and interpret the law.\n   Indeed, Banks went even further and withheld copyright\nprotection from headnotes and syllabi produced by judges.\n128 U. S., at 253. Surely these supplementary materials do\nnot have the force of law, yet they are covered by the doc-\ntrine. The simplest explanation is the one Banks provided:\nThese non-binding works are not copyrightable because of\nwho creates them\u2014judges acting in their judicial capacity.\n\f16           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nSee ibid.\n  The same goes for non-binding legislative materials pro-\nduced by legislative bodies acting in a legislative capacity.\nThere is a broad array of such works ranging from floor\nstatements to proposed bills to committee reports. Under\nthe logic of Georgia\u2019s \u201cforce of law\u201d test, States would own\nsuch materials and could charge the public for access to\nthem.\n  Furthermore, despite Georgia\u2019s and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\npurported concern for the text of the Copyright Act, their\nconception of the government edicts doctrine has less of a\ntextual footing than the traditional formulation. The tex-\ntual basis for the doctrine is the Act\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d require-\nment, which unsurprisingly focuses on\u2014the author.\nJUSTICE THOMAS urges us to dig deeper to \u201cthe root\u201d of our\ngovernment edicts precedents. Post, at 5. But, in our view,\nthe text is the root. The Court long ago interpreted the\nword \u201cauthor\u201d to exclude officials empowered to speak with\nthe force of law, and Congress has carried that meaning for-\nward in multiple iterations of the Copyright Act. This tex-\ntual foundation explains why the doctrine distinguishes be-\ntween some authors (who are empowered to speak with the\nforce of law) and others (who are not). Compare Callaghan,\n128 U. S., at 647, with Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. But the\nAct\u2019s reference to \u201cauthorship\u201d provides no basis for Geor-\ngia\u2019s rule distinguishing between different categories of\ncontent with different effects.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Instead of accepting our predecessors\u2019 textual reasoning at face value,\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS conjures a trinity of alternative \u201corigin[s] and justifica-\ntion[s]\u201d for the government edicts doctrine that the Court might have had\nin mind. See post, at 5\u20137. Without committing to one or all of these\npossibilities, JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that each would yield a rule that\nrequires federal courts to pick out the subset of judicial and legislative\nmaterials that independently carry the force of law. But a Court moti-\nvated by JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s three-fold concerns might just as easily have\nread them as supporting a rule that prevents the officials responsible for\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Imagine a Georgia citizen in-\nterested in learning his legal rights and duties. If he reads\nthe economy-class version of the Georgia Code available\nonline, he will see laws requiring political candidates to pay\nhefty qualification fees (with no indigency exception), crim-\ninalizing broad categories of consensual sexual conduct,\nand exempting certain key evidence in criminal trials\nfrom standard evidentiary limitations\u2014with no hint\nthat important aspects of those laws have been held uncon-\nstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court. See OCGA\n\u00a7\u00a721\u20132\u2013131, 16\u20136\u20132, 16\u20136\u201318, 16\u201315\u20139 (available at\nwww.legis.ga.gov). Meanwhile, first-class readers with\naccess to the annotations will be assured that these laws\nare, in crucial respects, unenforceable relics that the legis-\nlature has not bothered to narrow or repeal. See \u00a7\u00a721\u20132\u2013\n131, 16\u20136\u20132, 16\u20136\u201318, 16\u201315\u20139 (available at https://store.\nlexisnexis.com/products/official-code-of-georgia-annotated-\nskuSKU6647 for $412.00).\n   If everything short of statutes and opinions were copy-\nrightable, then States would be free to offer a whole range\nof premium legal works for those who can afford the extra\nbenefit. A State could monetize its entire suite of legislative\nhistory. With today\u2019s digital tools, States might even\nlaunch a subscription or pay-per-law service.\n   There is no need to assume inventive or nefarious behav-\nior for these concerns to become a reality. Unlike other\nforms of intellectual property, copyright protection is both\ninstant and automatic. It vests as soon as a work is cap-\ntured in a tangible form, triggering a panoply of exclusive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncreating binding materials from qualifying as an \u201cauthor.\u201d Regardless,\nit is more \u201c[ ]consistent with the judicial role\u201d to apply the reasoning and\nresults the Court voted on and committed to writing than to speculate\nabout what practical considerations our predecessors \u201cmay have had\n. . . in mind,\u201d what history \u201cmay [have] suggest[ed],\u201d or what constitu-\ntional concerns \u201cmay have animated\u201d our government edicts precedents.\nIbid.\n\f18        GEORGIA v.

If Georgia were correct, then unless a State took the\naffirmative step of transferring its copyrights to the public\ndomain, all of its judges\u2019 and legislators\u2019 non-binding legal\nworks would be copyrighted. And citizens, attorneys, non-\nprofits, and private research companies would have to cease\nall copying, distribution, and display of those works or risk\nsevere and potentially criminal penalties. \u00a7\u00a7501\u2013506.\nSome affected parties might be willing to roll the dice with\na potential fair use defense. But that defense, designed to\naccommodate First Amendment concerns, is notoriously\nfact sensitive and often cannot be resolved without a trial.\nCf. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises,\n471 U. S. 539, 552, 560\u2013561 (1985). The less bold among us\nwould have to think twice before using official legal works\nthat illuminate the law we are all presumed to know and\nunderstand.\n  Thankfully, there is a clear path forward that avoids\nthese concerns\u2014the one we are already on. Instead of ex-\namining whether given material carries \u201cthe force of law,\u201d\nwe ask only whether the author of the work is a judge or a\nlegislator. If so, then whatever work that judge or legislator\nproduces in the course of his judicial or legislative duties is\nnot copyrightable. That is the framework our precedents\nlong ago established, and we adhere to those precedents\ntoday.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\nEleventh Circuit.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

And, after straining to conclude\nthat the Georgia Code Revision Commission (Commission)\nis an arm of the Georgia Legislature, ante, at 9\u201310, the ma-\njority concludes that Georgia cannot hold a copyright in the\nannotations that are included as part of the Official Code of\nGeorgia Annotated (OCGA). This ruling will likely come as\na shock to the 25 other jurisdictions\u201422 States, 2 Territo-\nries, and the District of Columbia\u2014that rely on arrange-\nments similar to Georgia\u2019s to produce annotated codes. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae 15, and\nApp. to id., at 1. Perhaps these jurisdictions all overlooked\nthis Court\u2019s purportedly clear guidance. Or perhaps the\nwidespread use of these arrangements indicates that to-\nday\u2019s decision extends the government edicts doctrine to a\nnew context, rather than simply \u201cconfirm[ing]\u201d what the\nprecedents have always held. See ante, at 5. Because I be-\nlieve we should \u201cleave to Congress the task of deciding\nwhether the Copyright Act needs an upgrade,\u201d American\n\f2         GEORGIA v.

Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court first\nregarded it as self-evident that judicial opinions cannot be\ncopyrighted either by the judges who signed them or by a\nreporter under whose auspices they are published. Con-\ngress provided that, in return for a salary of $1,000, the Re-\nporter of Decisions for this Court would prepare reports\nconsisting of judicial opinions and additional materials\nsummarizing the cases. Id., at 614, 617 (argument).\nWheaton, one of this Court\u2019s earliest Reporters, argued that\nhe owned a copyright for the entirety of his reports. He con-\ntended that he had \u201cacquired the right to the opinions by\njudges\u2019 gift\u201d once they became a part of his volume. Id., at\n614 (same). The Court ultimately remanded on the ques-\ntion whether Wheaton had complied with the Copyright\nAct\u2019s procedural requirements. Id., at 667\u2013668. In doing\nso, it observed in dicta that \u201cthe court [was] unanimously of\n[the] opinion, that no reporter has or can have any copy-\nright in the written opinions delivered by this court; and\nthat the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any\nsuch right.\u201d Id., at 668.\n   Fifty-four years later, the Court returned to the same\nsubject, suggesting a doctrinal basis for the rule that judi-\ncial opinions and certain closely related materials cannot be\ncopyrighted. In Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244 (1888),\nthe state-authorized publisher of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecisions, Banks & Brothers, sued a competing publisher\nfor copyright infringement. The competing publisher repro-\nduced portions from Banks\u2019 reports, including Ohio Su-\npreme Court decisions, statements of the cases, and syllabi,\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

This Court held that these materials were\nnot the proper subject of copyright. In reaching that con-\nclusion, the Court grounded its analysis in its interpreta-\ntion of the word \u201cauthor\u201d in the Copyright Act. It anchored\nthis interpretation in the \u201cpublic policy\u201d that \u201cthe judge\nwho, in his judicial capacity, prepares the opinion or deci-\nsion [and other materials]\u201d is not \u201cregarded as their author\nor their proprietor, in the sense of [the Copyright Act], so as\nto be able to confer any title by assignment.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S., at 253. The Court supported this conclusion by stat-\ning that \u201cthere has always been a judicial consensus . . .\nthat no copyright could[,] under the statutes passed by Con-\ngress, be secured in the products of the labor done by judi-\ncial officers in the discharge of their judicial duties.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis deleted). And the Court observed that this rule\nreflected the view that the \u201cauthentic exposition and inter-\npretation of the law . . . is free for publication to all,\u201d which\nin turn prevents a judge from qualifying as an author. Ibid.\n   Importantly, the Court also briefly discussed whether the\nState of Ohio could directly hold the copyright. In answer-\ning this question, the Court did not suggest that States\nwere categorically prohibited from holding copyrights as\nauthors or assignees. Instead, the Court simply noted that\nthe State fell outside the scope of the Act because it was not\na \u201cresident\u201d or \u201ccitizen of the United States,\u201d as then re-\nquired by statute, and because it did not meet other statu-\ntory criteria. Ibid. The Court felt it necessary to observe,\nhowever, that \u201c[w]hether the State could take out a copy-\nright for itself, or could enjoy the benefit of one taken out\nby an individual for it, as the assignee of a citizen of the\nUnited States or a resident therein, who should be the au-\nthor of a book, is a question not involved in the present case,\nand we refrain from considering it.\u201d Ibid.\n   Finally, in Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617 (1888), the\n\f4         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt addressed the limits of the government edicts doc-\ntrine. In that case, the Court settled another dispute be-\ntween a publisher of court decisions and an alleged in-\nfringer. The plaintiff purchased the proprietary rights to\nthe reports prepared by the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s re-\nporter of decisions, Freeman, including the copyright to the\nreports. Unlike in Banks, these reports also contained ma-\nterial authored by Freeman. Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 645.\nThe alleged infringers copied the judicial decisions and\nFreeman\u2019s materials. In finding for the plaintiff, this Court\nreiterated that \u201cthere can be no copyright in the opinions of\nthe judges, or in the work done by them in their official ca-\npacity as judges.\u201d Id., at 647 (citing Banks, 128 U. S. 244).\nBut the Court concluded that \u201cno [similar] ground of public\npolicy\u201d justified denying a state official a copyright\n\u201ccover[ing] the matter which is the result of his intellectual\nlabor.\u201d Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 647.\n                             II\n   These precedents establish that judicial opinions cannot\nbe copyrighted. But they do not exclude from copyright pro-\ntection notes that are prepared by an official court reporter\nand published together with the reported opinions. There\nis no apparent reason why the same logic would not apply\nto statutes and regulations. Thus, it must follow from our\nprecedents that statutes and regulations cannot be copy-\nrighted, but accompanying notes lacking legal force can be.\nSee Howell v. Miller, 91 F. 129 (CA6 1898) (Harlan, J.) (ex-\nplaining that, under Banks and Callaghan, annotations to\nMichigan statutes could be copyrighted).\n                               A\n  It is fair to say that the Court\u2019s 19th-century decisions do\nnot provide any extended explanation of the basis for the\ngovernment edicts doctrine. The majority is nonetheless\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

But the contours of the rule were\nfar from clear, and to understand the scope of the doctrine,\nwe must explore its underlying rationale.\n   In my view, the majority\u2019s uncritical extrapolation of\nprecedent is inconsistent with the judicial role. An unwill-\ningness to examine the root of a precedent has led to the\nsprouting of many noxious weeds that distort the meaning\nof the Constitution and statutes alike. Although we have\nnot been asked to revisit these precedents, it behooves us to\nexplore the origin of and justification for them, especially\nwhen we are asked to apply their rule for the first time in\nover 130 years.\n   The Court\u2019s precedents suggest three possible grounds\nsupporting their conclusion. In Banks, the Court referred\nto the meaning of the term \u201cauthor\u201d in copyright law. While\nthe Court did not develop this argument, it is conceivable\nthat the contemporaneous public meaning of the term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d was narrower in the copyright context than in ordi-\nnary speech. At the time this Court decided Banks, the\nCopyright Act provided protection for books, maps, prints,\nengravings, musical and dramatic compositions, photo-\ngraphs, and works of art.1 Judicial opinions differ markedly\nfrom these works. Books, for instance, express the thoughts\nof their authors. They typically have no power beyond the\nability of their words to influence readers, and they usually\nare published at private expense. Judicial opinions, on the\nother hand, do not simply express the thoughts of the\njudges who write or endorse them. Instead, they elaborate\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See 1 Stat. 124; 2 Stat. 171; ch. 16, 4 Stat. 436; 11 Stat. 138\u2013139; 13\n\nStat. 540; 16 Stat. 212.\n\f6          GEORGIA v.

Unlike other copyright-\nable works of authorship, judicial opinions have binding le-\ngal effect, and they are produced and issued at public\nexpense. Moreover, copyright law understands an author\nto be one whose work will be encouraged by the grant of an\nexclusive right. See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,\n579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6). But judges, when\nacting in an official capacity, do not fit that description. The\nCourt in Banks may have had these differences in mind\nwhen it concluded that a judge fell outside the scope of the\nterm \u201cauthor.\u201d 128 U. S., at 253.\n   History may also suggest a narrower meaning of \u201cauthor\u201d\nin the copyright context. In England, at least as far back as\n1666, courts and commentators agreed \u201cthat the property\nof all law books is in the king, because he pays the judges\nwho pronounce the law.\u201d G. Curtis, Law of Copyright 130\n(1847); see also Banks & Bros. v. West Publishing Co., 27 F.\n50, 57 (CC Minn. 1886) (citing English cases and treatises\nand concluding that \u201cEnglish courts generally sustain the\ncrown\u2019s proprietary rights in judicial opinions\u201d). Black-\nstone described this as a \u201cprerogative copyrigh[t],\u201d explain-\ning that \u201c[t]he king, as the executive magistrate, has the\nright of promulging to the people all acts of state and gov-\nernment. This gives him the exclusive privilege of printing,\nat his own press, or that of his grantees, all acts of parlia-\nment, proclamations, and orders of council.\u201d 2 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 410 (1766)\n(emphasis deleted); see also Wheaton, 8 Pet., at 659\u2013660.\nThis history helps to explain the dearth of cases permitting\nindividuals to obtain copyrights in judicial opinions.

As one court put it, \u201c[t]he decisions and\nopinions of the justices are the authorized expositions and\ninterpretations of the laws, which are binding upon all the\ncitizens. . . . Every citizen is presumed to know the law thus\ndeclared, and it needs no argument to show that justice re-\nquires that all should have free access to the opinions.\u201d\nNash v. Lathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 35, 6 N. E. 559, 560 (1886)\n(cited in Banks, 128 U. S., at 253\u2013254); see also American\nSoc. for Testing and Materials v.

First, unlike judicial opinions and statutes,\nthese annotations do not even purport to embody the will of\nthe people because they are not law. The General Assembly\nof Georgia has made abundantly clear through a variety of\nprovisions that the annotations do not create any binding\nobligations. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20137 states that \u201c[a]ll historical cita-\ntions, title and chapter analyses, and notes set out in this\nCode are given for the purpose of convenient reference and\ndo not constitute part of the law.\u201d Section 1\u20131\u20131 further\nprovides that \u201c[t]he statutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws . . . is enacted and shall have the effect of stat-\nutes enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia. The stat-\nutory portion of such codification shall be merged with an-\nnotations . . . and other materials . . . and shall be published\nby authority of the state.\u201d Thus, although the materials\n\f8         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cmerge\u201d prior to publication in the \u201cofficial\u201d code, the very\nprovision calling for that merger makes clear that the an-\nnotations serve as commentary, not law.\n   As additional evidence that the annotations do not repre-\nsent the will of the people, the General Assembly does not\nenact statutory annotations under its legislative power.\nSee Ga. Const., Art. III, \u00a71, \u00b61 (vesting the legislative power\nin the General Assembly). To enact state law, Georgia em-\nploys a process of bicameralism and presentment similar to\nthat embodied in the United States Constitution. See Ga.\nConst., Art. III, \u00a75; Art. V, \u00a72, \u00b64. The annotations do not\ngo through this process, a fact that even the majority must\nacknowledge. Ante, at 10; Ga. S. 52, Reg. Sess., \u00a754(b)\n(2019\u20132020) (\u201cAnnotations . . . except as otherwise provided\nin the Code . . . are not enacted as statutes by the provisions\nof this Act\u201d).\n   Second, unlike judges and legislators, the creators of an-\nnotations are incentivized by the copyright laws to produce\na desirable product that will eventually earn them a profit.\nAnd though the Commission may require Lexis to follow\nstrict guidelines, the independent synthesis, analysis, and\ncreative drafting behind the annotations makes them anal-\nogous to other copyrightable materials. See Brief for Mat-\nthew Bender & Co., Inc., as Amicus Curiae 4\u20137.\n   Lastly, the annotations do not impede fair notice of the\nlaws. As just stated, the annotations do not carry the bind-\ning force of law. They simply summarize independent\nsources of legal information and consolidate them in one\nplace. Thus, OCGA annotations serve a similar function to\nother copyrighted research tools provided by private parties\nsuch as the American Law Reports and Westlaw, which also\ncontain information of great \u201cpractical significance.\u201d Ante,\nat 17. Compare, e.g., OCGA \u00a734\u20139\u2013260 (annotation for Cho\nCarwash Property, L. L. C. v. Everett, 326 Ga. App. 6, 755\nS. E. 2d 823 (2014)) with Ga. Code Ann. \u00a734\u20139\u2013260\n(Westlaw\u2019s annotation for the same).\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Ante, at 17.\nThat is simply incorrect. As the majority tacitly concedes,\na person seeking information about changes in Georgia\nstatutory law can find that information by consulting the\noriginal source for the change in the law\u2019s status\u2014the court\ndecisions themselves. See ante, at 17. The inability to ac-\ncess the OCGA merely deprives a researcher of one specific\ntool, not to the underlying factual or legal information sum-\nmarized in that tool. See also post, at 4 (GINSBURG, J., dis-\nsenting).2\n                            C\n  The text of the Copyright Act supports my reading of the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The majority contends that, rather than seeking to understand the\n\norigins of our precedents, we should simply accept the text of the opinions\nthat the Justices \u201cvoted on and committed to writing.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317,\nn. 4. But that begs the question: What does the text of the relevant opin-\nions tell us? The answer is not much. It is precisely this lack of explica-\ntion that makes it necessary to explore the \u201cjudicial consensus\u201d and pub-\nlic policy referred to in Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244, 253 (1888).\nInstead, the majority attempts to dissect the language of our prior opin-\nions in the same way it would interpret a statute, an approach we have\nrepeatedly cautioned against. See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509\nU. S. 502, 515 (1993); Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 341 (1979).\nThe proper approach is to \u201cread general language in judicial opinions . . .\nas referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances\nthen before the Court and not referring to quite different circumstances\nthat the Court was not then considering.\u201d Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U. S.\n419, 424 (2004); see also Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399 (1821)\n(Marshall, C. J., for the Court) (\u201c[G]eneral expressions, in every opinion,\nare to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions\nare used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought\nnot to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is\npresented for decision\u201d).\n\f10          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprecedents.3 Specifically, there are four indications in the\ntext of the Copyright Act that the OCGA annotations are\ncopyrightable. As an initial matter, the Act does not define\nthe word \u201cauthor,\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7101, or make any reference\nto the government edicts doctrine. Accordingly, the term\n\u201cauthor\u201d itself does not shed any light on whether the doc-\ntrine covers statutory annotations. Second, while the Act\nexcludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s] prepared by an\nofficer or employee of the United States Government as part\nof that person\u2019s official duties,\u201d \u00a7101; see also \u00a7105, the Act\ncontains no similar prohibition against works of state gov-\nernments or works prepared at their behest. \u201cCongress\u2019 use\nof explicit language in one provision cautions against infer-\nring the same limitation\u201d elsewhere in the statute. State\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n580 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Val-\nladolid, 565 U. S. 207, 216 (2012). Third, the Act specifi-\ncally notes that annotations are copyrightable derivative\nworks. \u00a7101. Here, again, the Act does not expressly ex-\nclude from copyright protection annotations created either\nby the State or at the State\u2019s request. Fourth, the Act pro-\nvides that an author may hold a copyright in \u201cmaterial con-\ntributed\u201d in a derivative work, \u201cas distinguished from the\npreexisting material employed in the work.\u201d \u00a7103(b); see\nalso Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.,\n499 U. S. 340, 359 (1991). These aspects of the statutory\ntext, taken together, further support the conclusion that the\nOCGA annotations are copyrightable.\n   For all these reasons, I would conclude that, as with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the majority explains, ante, at 9, the annotations were created as\n\npart of a work-for-hire agreement between the Commission and Lexis.\nSee 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b). Because no party disputes the validity of the\ncontract, I express no opinion regarding whether the contract established\nan employer/employee relationship or whether the Commission may be\nconsidered a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7201(b).\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

In\nits view, the Court in Banks held that judges are not \u201cau-\nthors\u201d within the scope of the Copyright Act for \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d 128 U. S., at\n253, so the same must be true for legislators, see ante, at 8\u2013\n9. Accordingly, works created by legislators in their legis-\nlative capacity are not \u201coriginal works of authorship,\u201d \u00a7102,\nand therefore cannot be copyrighted. This argument is\nflawed in multiple respects.\n                               A\n   Most notably, the majority\u2019s textual analysis hinges on\naccepting that its construction of \u201cauthorship,\u201d i.e., all\nworks produced in a judge\u2019s or legislator\u2019s official capacity,\nwas so well established by our 19th-century precedents that\nCongress incorporated it into the multiple revisions of the\nCopyright Act. See ante, at 12\u201313. Such confidence is ques-\ntionable, to say the least.\n   The majority\u2019s understanding of the government edicts\ndoctrine seems to have been lost on dozens of States and\nTerritories, as well as the lower courts in this case. As al-\nready stated, the 25 jurisdictions with official annotated\ncodes apparently did not view this Court\u2019s precedents as es-\ntablishing the \u201cofficial duties\u201d definition of authorship. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae.4 And if\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 According to one study published in 2000, approximately half of\n\nStates owned copyright in official state statutory compilations, court re-\nports, or administrative regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of\nCopyrights in Primary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertain-\nment L. J. 81, 83, 97\u2013105 (2000). The majority attempts to undermine\nthis study by emphasizing that some of these States owned copyright in\nprimary law materials. Ante, at 13, n. 3. This misunderstands the point.\n\f12          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cour precedents answer the question\u201d so clearly, ante, at 14,\none wonders why the Eleventh Circuit reached its conclu-\nsion in such a roundabout fashion. Rather than following\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cstraightforward\u201d path, ante, at 5, the Elev-\nenth Circuit looked to the \u201czone of indeterminacy at the\nfrontier between edicts that carry the force of law and\nthose that do not\u201d to determine whether the annotations\nwere \u201csufficiently law-like\u201d to be \u201cconstructively authored\nby the People.\u201d Code Revision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Re-\nsource.Org, Inc., 906 F. 3d 1229, 1233, 1242, 1243 (2018).\nThe District Court likewise does not appear to have viewed\nthe question as well settled. In a cursory analysis, it deter-\nmined that the annotations were copyrightable based on\nCallaghan. Code Revision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org,\nInc., 244 F. Supp. 3d 1350, 1356 (ND Ga. 2017). It is risible\nto presume that Congress had knowledge of and incorpo-\nrated a \u201csettled\u201d meaning that eluded a multitude of States\nand Territories, as well as at least four Article III judges.\nAnte, at 13. Cf. Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n  This presumption of congressional knowledge also pro-\nvides the basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the anno-\ntations are not \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d See ante, at\n11\u201312 (discussing \u00a7101). Stripped of the fiction that this\nCourt\u2019s 19th-century precedents clearly demonstrated that\n\u201cauthorship\u201d encompassed all works performed as part of a\nlegislator\u2019s duties, the majority\u2019s textual argument fails.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI do not claim that this evidence demonstrates that the States neces-\nsarily interpreted the government edicts doctrine correctly. I merely\npoint out that these divergent practices seriously undercut the majority\u2019s\nclaim that its interpretation of \u201cauthorship\u201d was well settled and univer-\nsally understood. On this score, the majority has no answer but to insin-\nuate that the lawmakers of over half the Nation\u2019s jurisdictions disre-\ngarded federal law and the Constitution to pursue their own agendas in\nthe face of supposedly clear precedent.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    13\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The majority does not confront this criticism head on. In-\nstead, it simply repeats, without any further elaboration,\nits unsupported conclusion that \u201c[t]he Court long ago inter-\npreted the word \u2018author\u2019 to exclude officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law, and Congress has carried that\nmeaning forward in multiple iterations of the Copyright\nAct.\u201d Ante, at 16. This wave of the \u201cmagic wand of ipse\ndixit\u201d does nothing to strengthen the majority\u2019s argument,\nand in fact only serves to underscore its weakness. United\nStates v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 77 (1984) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting).5\n                                B\n  In addition to its textual deficiencies, the majority\u2019s un-\nderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedents fails to account for\nthe critical differences between the role that judicial opin-\nions play in expounding upon the law compared to that of\nstatutes. The majority finds it meaningful, for instance,\nthat Banks prohibited dissents and concurrences from be-\ning copyrighted, even though they carry no legal force.\nAnte, at 15. At an elementary level, it is true that the judg-\nment is the only part of a judicial decision that has legal\neffect. But it blinks reality to ignore that every word of a\njudicial opinion\u2014whether it is a majority, a concurrence, or\na dissent\u2014expounds upon the law in ways that do not map\nneatly on to the legislative function. Setting aside sum-\nmary decisions, the reader of a judicial opinion will always\ngain critical insight into the reasoning underlying a judicial\nholding by reading all opinions in their entirety. Under-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority\u2019s approach is also hard to reconcile with the recognition\n\nin Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), that annotations prepared by the\nReporter of Decisions could be copyrighted. Wheaton was paid a salary\nof $1,000, and it is difficult to say whether this salary funded his work\non the opinions or his work on the annotations. See id., at 614, 617 (ar-\ngument).\n\f14           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nstanding the reasoning that animates the rule in turn pro-\nvides pivotal insight into how the law will likely be applied\nin future judicial opinions.6 Thus, deprived of access to ju-\ndicial opinions, individuals cannot access the primary, and\ntherefore best, source of information for the meaning of the\nlaw.7 And as true as that is today, access to these opinions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 For instance, this Court has not overruled Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403\n\nU. S. 602 (1971), which pronounced a test for evaluating Establishment\nClause claims. But a reader would do well to carefully scrutinize the\nvarious opinions in American Legion v. American Humanist Assn., 588\nU. S. ___ (2019), to understand the markedly different way that this prec-\nedent functions in our current jurisprudence compared to when it was\nfirst decided. Moreover, sometimes a separate writing takes on canonical\nstatus, like Justice Jackson\u2019s concurrence regarding the executive power\nin Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 634\u2013638\n(1952) (opinion concurring in judgment and opinion of the Court); see\nalso Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 360\u2013361 (1967) (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring) (reasonable expectation of privacy Fourth Amendment test).\nStill other times, the reasoning in an opinion for less than a majority of\nthe Court provides the explicit basis for a later majority\u2019s holding. See,\ne.g., McKinney v. Arizona, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 5) (dis-\ncussing Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 612 (2002) (Scalia J., concur-\nring)); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.

See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a72\u20134\u2013203(1)(c) (2019); Iowa Code \u00a74.6(3)\n(2019); Minn. Stat. \u00a7645.16(7) (2018); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a712\u20132A\u201320(C)(2)\n(2019); N. D.

PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmatter, the majority\u2019s rule will prove difficult to administer.\nAccording to one group of amici, nearly all jurisdictions\nwith annotated codes use private contractors that \u201calmost\ninvariably prepare [annotations] under the supervision of\nlegislative-branch or judicial-branch officials, including\nstate legislators or state-court judges.\u201d Brief for State of\nArkansas et al. as Amici Curiae 16\u201317. Under the major-\nity\u2019s view, any one of these commissions or counsels could\npotentially be reclassified as an \u201cadjunct to the legislature.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. But the majority\u2019s test for ascertaining the true\nnature of these commissions raises far more questions than\nit answers.\n   The majority lists a number of factors\u2014including the\nCommission\u2019s membership and funding, how the annota-\ntions become part of the OCGA, and descriptions of the\nCommission from court cases\u2014to support its conclusion\nthat the Commission is really part of the legislature. See\nante, at 9\u201310. But it does not specify whether these factors\nare exhaustive or illustrative and, if the latter, what other\nfactors may be important. The majority also does not spec-\nify whether some factors weigh more heavily than others\nwhen deciding whether to deem an oversight body a legis-\nlative adjunct.\n   And even when the majority does list concrete factors,\npivotal guidance remains lacking. For example, the major-\nity finds it meaningful that 9 out of the Commission\u2019s 15\nmembers are legislators. Ante, at 9; see OCGA \u00a728\u20139\u20132\n(noting that the other members of the Commission include\nthe State\u2019s Lieutenant Governor, a judge, a district attor-\nney, and three other state bar members). But how many\nlegislative members are needed for a commission to become\na legislative adjunct? The majority provides no answers to\nany of these questions.\n                         *     *    *\n     The majority\u2019s rule will leave in the lurch the many\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

Perhaps, to the detriment\nof all, many States will stop producing annotated codes\naltogether. Were that to occur, the majority\u2019s fear of an\n\u201ceconomy-class\u201d version of the law will truly become a real-\nity. See ante, at 17. As Georgia explains, its contract ena-\nbles the OCGA to be sold at a fraction of the cost of compet-\ning annotated codes. For example, Georgia asserts that\nLexis sold the OCGA for $404 in 2016, while West Publish-\ning\u2019s competing annotated code sold for $2,570. Should\nstate annotated codes disappear, those without the means\nto pay the competitor\u2019s significantly higher price tag will\nhave a valuable research tool taken away from them.\nMeanwhile, this Court, which is privileged to have access to\nnumerous research resources, will scarcely notice. These\nnegative practical ramifications are unfortunate enough\nwhen they reflect the deliberative legislative choices that\nwe as judges are bound to respect. They are all the more\nregrettable when they are the result of our own meddling.\nFortunately, as the majority and I agree, \u201c \u2018critics of [to-\nday\u2019s] ruling can take their objections across the street,\n[where] Congress can correct any mistake it sees.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n13 (quoting Kimble v.

Nor are\nother materials created by state legislators in the course of\nperforming their lawmaking responsibilities, e.g., legisla-\ntive committee reports, floor statements, unenacted bills.\nAnte, at 8\u20139. Not all that legislators do, however, is ineligi-\nble for copyright protection; the government edicts doctrine\nshields only \u201cworks that are (1) created by judges and leg-\nislators (2) in the course of their judicial and legislative du-\nties.\u201d Ante, at 9 (emphasis added). The core question this\ncase presents, as I see it: Are the annotations in the Official\nCode of Georgia Annotated (OCGA) done in a legislative ca-\npacity? The answer, I am persuaded, should be no.\n   To explain why, I proceed from common ground. All\nagree that headnotes and syllabi for judicial opinions\u2014both\na kind of annotation\u2014are copyrightable when created by a\nreporter of decisions, Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617,\n645\u2013650 (1888), but are not copyrightable when created by\njudges, Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244, 253 (1888).\nThat is so because \u201c[t]he whole work done by . . . judges,\u201d\nibid., including dissenting and concurring opinions, ranks\nas work performed in their judicial capacity. Judges do not\noutsource their writings to \u201carm[s]\u201d or \u201cadjunct[s],\u201d cf. ante,\nat 9, 11, to be composed in their stead. Accordingly, the\n\f2           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\njudicial opinion-drafting process in its entirety\u2014including\nthe drafting of headnotes and syllabi, in jurisdictions where\nthat is done by judges\u2014falls outside the reach of copyright\nprotection.\n  One might ask: If a judge\u2019s annotations are not copyright-\nable, why are those created by legislators? The answer lies\nin the difference between the role of a judge and the role of\na legislator. \u201c[T]o the judiciary\u201d we assign \u201cthe duty of in-\nterpreting and applying\u201d the law, Massachusetts v. Mellon,\n262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923), and sometimes making the appli-\ncable law, see Friendly, In Praise of Erie\u2014and of the New\nFederal Common Law, 39 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 383 (1964). See\nalso Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (\u201cIt is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-\nment to say what the law is.\u201d). In contrast, the role of the\nlegislature encompasses the process of \u201cmaking laws\u201d\u2014not\nconstruing statutes after their enactment. Mellon, 262\nU. S., at 488; see Patchak v. Zinke, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5) (\u201c[T]he legislative power is\nthe power to make law.\u201d). The OCGA annotations, in my\nappraisal, do not rank as part of the Georgia Legislature\u2019s\nlawmaking process for three reasons.\n  First, the annotations are not created contemporaneously\nwith the statutes to which they pertain; instead, the anno-\ntations comment on statutes already enacted. See, e.g.,\nApp. 268\u2013269 (text of enacted laws are transmitted to the\npublisher for the addition of commentary); id., at 403\u2013404\n(publisher adds new case notes on a rolling basis as courts\nconstrue existing statutes).1 In short, annotating begins\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For example, OCGA \u00a711\u20132A\u2013213 was enacted, in its current form, in\n\n1993. See 1993 Ga. Laws p. 633. The case notes contained in the OCGA\nsummarize judicial decisions construing the statute years later. See\n\u00a711\u20132A\u2013213 (2002) (citing Griffith v. Medical Rental Supply of Albany,\nGa., Inc., 244 Ga. App. 120, 534 S. E. 2d 859 (2000); Bailey v. Tucker\nEquip. Sales, Inc., 236 Ga. App. 289, 510 S. E. 2d 904 (1999)).\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nonly after lawmaking ends. This sets the OCGA annota-\ntions apart from uncopyrightable legislative materials like\ncommittee reports, generated before a law\u2019s enactment, and\ntied tightly to the task of law-formulation.\n   Second, the OCGA annotations are descriptive rather\nthan prescriptive. Instead of stating the legislature\u2019s per-\nception of what a law conveys, the annotations summarize\nwritings in which others express their views on a given stat-\nute. For example, the OCGA contains \u201ccase annotations\u201d\nfor \u201c[a]ll decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the\nCourt of Appeals of Georgia and all decisions of the federal\ncourts in cases which arose in Georgia construing any por-\ntion of the general statutory law of the state.\u201d Id., at 403.\nPer the Code Revision Commission\u2019s instructions, each an-\nnotation should \u201caccurately reflect the facts, holding, and\nstatutory construction\u201d adopted by the court. Id., at 404.\nThe annotations are neutrally cast; they do not opine on\nwhether the summarized case was correctly decided. See,\ne.g., OCGA \u00a717\u20137\u201350 (2013) (case annotation summarizing\nfacts and holdings of nine cases construing right to grand\njury hearing). This characteristic of the annotations distin-\nguishes them from preenactment legislative materials that\ntouch or concern the correct interpretation of the legisla-\nture\u2019s work.\n   Third, and of prime importance, the OCGA annotations\nare \u201cgiven for the purpose of convenient reference\u201d by the\npublic, \u00a71\u20131\u20137 (2019); they aim to inform the citizenry at\nlarge, they do not address, particularly, those seated in leg-\nislative chambers.2 Annotations are thus unlike, for exam-\nple, surveys, work commissioned by a legislature to aid in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Suppose a committee of Georgia\u2019s legislature, to inform the public,\n\ninstructs a staffer to write a guide titled \u201cThe Workways of the Georgia\nLegislature.\u201d The final text describing how the legislature operates is\ncirculated to members of the legislature and approved by a majority.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s decision, I take it that such a work, which entails\nno lawmaking, would be copyrightable.\n\f4            GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndetermining whether existing law should be amended.\n   The requirement that the statutory portions of the OCGA\n\u201cshall be merged with annotations,\u201d \u00a71\u20131\u20131, does not ren-\nder the annotations anything other than explanatory, ref-\nerential, or commentarial material. See Harrison Co. v.\nCode Revision Comm\u2019n, 244 Ga. 325, 331, 260 S. E. 2d 30,\n35 (1979) (observation by the Supreme Court of Georgia\nthat \u201cinclusion of annotations in [the] \u2018official Code\u2019 \u201d does\nnot \u201cgive the annotations any official weight\u201d).3 Annota-\ntions aid the legal researcher, and that aid is enhanced\nwhen annotations are printed beneath or alongside the rel-\nevant statutory text. But the placement of annotations in\nthe OCGA does not alter their auxiliary, nonlegislative\ncharacter.\n\n                       *     *     *\n   Because summarizing judicial decisions and commentary\nbearing on enacted statutes, in contrast to, for example,\ndrafting a committee report to accompany proposed legisla-\ntion, is not done in a legislator\u2019s law-shaping capacity, I\nwould hold the OCGA annotations copyrightable and there-\nfore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 That the Georgia Supreme Court described the Commission\u2019s work as\n\n\u201cwithin the sphere of legislative authority\u201d for state separation-of-powers\npurposes, Harrison Co. v.

Under the government edicts doctrine,\n  officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot be the au-\n  thors of the works they create in the course of their official duties.\n     The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the Official Code of Geor-\n  gia Annotated (OCGA). That Code includes the text of every Georgia\n  statute currently in force, as well as a set of non-binding annotations\n  that appear beneath each statutory provision. The annotations typi-\n  cally include summaries of judicial opinions construing each provision,\n  summaries of pertinent opinions of the state attorney general, and a\n  list of related law review articles and other reference materials. The\n  OCGA is assembled by the Code Revision Commission, a state entity\n  composed mostly of legislators, funded through legislative branch ap-\n  propriations, and staffed by the Office of Legislative Counsel.\n     The annotations in the current OCGA were produced by Matthew\n  Bender & Co., Inc., a division of the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a\n  work-for-hire agreement with the Commission. Under the agreement,\n  Lexis drafts the annotations under the supervision of the Commission,\n  which specifies what the annotations must include in exacting detail.\n  The agreement also states that any copyright in the OCGA vests in the\n  State of Georgia, acting through the Commission.\n     Respondent Public.Resource.Org (PRO), a nonprofit dedicated to fa-\n  cilitating public access to government records and legal materials,\n  posted the OCGA online and distributed copies to various organiza-\n  tions and Georgia officials. After sending PRO several cease-and-de-\n  sist letters, the Commission sued PRO for infringing its copyright in\n  the OCGA annotations. PRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory\n  judgment that the entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\n\f2             GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    public domain. The District Court sided with the Commission, holding\n    that the annotations were eligible for copyright protection because\n    they had not been enacted into law. The Eleventh Circuit reversed,\n    rejecting the Commission\u2019s copyright assertion under the government\n    edicts doctrine.\nHeld: The OCGA annotations are ineligible for copyright protection.\n Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The government edicts doctrine developed from a trio of 19th-\n century cases. In Wheaton v. Peters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85911\"><a href=\"/opinion/85911/wheaton-and-donaldson-v-peters-and-grigg/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court held that no\n reporter can have a copyright in the Court\u2019s opinions and that the Jus-\n tices cannot confer such a right on any reporter.

Myers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92372\"><a href=\"/opinion/92372/callaghan-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n the Court reiterated that an official reporter cannot hold a copyright\n interest in opinions created by judges. But, confronting an issue not\n addressed in Wheaton or Banks, the Court upheld the reporter\u2019s copy-\n right interest in several explanatory materials that the reporter had\n created himself because they came from an author who had no author-\n ity to speak with the force of law.\n    The animating principle behind the government edicts doctrine is\n that no one can own the law. The doctrine gives effect to that principle\n in the copyright context through construction of the statutory term\n \u201cauthor.\u201d For purposes of the Copyright Act, judges cannot be the \u201cau-\n thor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity\u201d as lawmak-\n ers. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92329\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Banks,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/92329/banks-v-manchester/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Because legislators, like judges, have\n the authority to make law, it follows that they, too, cannot be \u201cau-\n thors.\u201d And, as with judges, the doctrine applies to whatever work\n legislators perform in their capacity as legislators, including explana-\n tory and procedural materials they create in the discharge of their leg-\n islative duties. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not copy-\n rightable. First, the author of the annotations qualifies as a legislator.\n Under the Copyright Act, the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the annotations is the\n Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7201(b), which functions as an arm of the\n Georgia Legislature in producing the annotations. Second, the Com-\n mission creates the annotations in the discharge of its legislative du-\n ties. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (c) Georgia argues that excluding the OCGA annotations from copy-\n right protection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. First, it\n notes that \u00a7101 lists \u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible\n for copyright protection. That provision, however, refers only to \u201can-\n notations . . . which . . . represent an original work of authorship.\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (Emphasis added.) Georgia\u2019s annotations do not fit that description\n  because they are prepared by a legislative body that cannot be deemed\n  the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works it creates in its official capacity. Second,\n  Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact that the Act excludes\n  from copyright protection works prepared by Federal Government of-\n  ficials, without establishing a similar rule for State officials. \u00a7\u00a7101,\n  105. That rule, however, applies to all federal officials, regardless of\n  the nature and scope of their duties. It does not suggest an intent to\n  displace the much narrower government edicts doctrine with respect\n  to the States.\n     Moving on from the text, Georgia invokes what it views as the offi-\n  cial position of the Copyright Office, as reflected in the Compendium\n  of U. S. Copyright Office Practices. The Compendium, however, is a\n  non-binding administrative manual and is largely consistent with this\n  Court\u2019s position. Georgia also appeals to copyright policy, but such\n  requests should be addressed to Congress, not the courts.\n     Georgia attempts to frame the government edicts doctrine to focus\n  exclusively on whether a particular work has the force of law. But that\n  understanding cannot be squared with precedent\u2014especially Banks.\n  Moreover, Georgia\u2019s conception of the doctrine as distinguishing be-\n  tween different categories of content with different effects has less of\n  a textual footing than the traditional formulation, which focuses on the\n  identity of the author. Georgia\u2019s characterization of the OCGA anno-\n  tations as non-binding and non-authoritative undersells the practical\n  significance of the annotations to litigants and citizens. And its ap-\n  proach would logically permit States to hide all non-binding judicial\n  and legislative work product\u2014including dissents and legislative his-\n  tory\u2014behind a paywall.

The question in this case is whether that protec-\ntion extends to the annotations contained in Georgia\u2019s\nofficial annotated code.\n   We hold that it does not. Over a century ago, we recog-\nnized a limitation on copyright protection for certain\ngovernment work product, rooted in the Copyright Act\u2019s\n\u201cauthorship\u201d requirement. Under what has been dubbed\nthe government edicts doctrine, officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law cannot be the authors of\u2014and\ntherefore cannot copyright\u2014the works they create in the\ncourse of their official duties.\n   We have previously applied that doctrine to hold that\nnon-binding, explanatory legal materials are not copyright-\nable when created by judges who possess the authority to\nmake and interpret the law.

Manchester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92329\"><a href=\"/opinion/92329/banks-v-manchester/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1888).

PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na legislative body vested with the authority to make law.\nBecause Georgia\u2019s annotations are authored by an arm\nof the legislature in the course of its legislative duties, the\ngovernment edicts doctrine puts them outside the reach of\ncopyright protection.\n                              I\n                              A\n   The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the \u201cOfficial\nCode of Georgia Annotated,\u201d or OCGA. The first page of\neach volume of the OCGA boasts the State\u2019s official seal and\nannounces to readers that it is \u201cPublished Under Authority\nof the State.\u201d\n   The OCGA includes the text of every Georgia statute\ncurrently in force, as well as various non-binding supple-\nmentary materials. At issue in this case is a set of annota-\ntions that appear beneath each statutory provision. The\nannotations generally include summaries of judicial deci-\nsions applying a given provision, summaries of any perti-\nnent opinions of the state attorney general, and a list of re-\nlated law review articles and similar reference materials.\nIn addition, the annotations often include editor\u2019s notes\nthat provide information about the origins of the statutory\ntext, such as whether it derives from a particular judicial\ndecision or resembles an older provision that has been con-\nstrued by Georgia courts. See, e.g., OCGA \u00a7\u00a751\u20131\u20131, 53\u20134\u2013\n2 (2019).\n   The OCGA is assembled by a state entity called the Code\nRevision Commission. In 1977, the Georgia Legislature\nestablished the Commission to recodify Georgia law for the\nfirst time in decades. The Commission was (and remains)\ntasked with consolidating disparate bills into a single Code\nfor reenactment by the legislature and contracting with a\nthird party to produce the annotations. A majority of the\nCommission\u2019s 15 members must be members of the Georgia\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Without permission, PRO posted a dig-\nital version of the OCGA on various websites, where it could\nbe downloaded by the public without charge. PRO also\ndistributed copies of the OCGA to various organizations\nand Georgia officials.\n   In response, the Commission sent PRO several cease-\nand-desist letters asserting that PRO\u2019s actions constituted\nunlawful copyright infringement. When PRO refused to\nhalt its distribution activities, the Commission sued PRO\non behalf of the Georgia Legislature and the State of Geor-\ngia for copyright infringement.

At the\noutset, Georgia advances two arguments for why, in its\nview, excluding the OCGA annotations from copyright\nprotection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. Both\nare unavailing.\n   First, Georgia notes that \u00a7101 of the Act specifically lists\n\u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible for copy-\nright protection. But that provision refers only to \u201cannota-\ntions . . . which . . . represent an original work of author-\nship.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7101 (emphasis added). The whole point\nof the government edicts doctrine is that judges and legis-\nlators cannot serve as authors when they produce works in\ntheir official capacity. While the reference to \u201cannotations\u201d\n\f12        GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin \u00a7101 may help explain why supplemental, explanatory\nmaterials are copyrightable when prepared by a private\nparty, or a non-lawmaking official like the reporter in Cal-\nlaghan, it does not speak to whether those same materials\nare copyrightable when prepared by a judge or a legislator.\nIn the same way that judicial materials are ineligible for\nprotection even though they plainly qualify as \u201c[l]iterary\nworks . . . expressed in words,\u201d ibid., legislative materials\nare ineligible for protection even if they happen to fit the\ndescription of otherwise copyrightable \u201cannotations.\u201d\n  Second, Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact\nthat the Act excludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s]\nprepared by an officer or employee of the United States\nGovernment as part of that person\u2019s official duties\u201d and\ndoes not establish a similar rule for the States. \u00a7101; see\nalso \u00a7105. But the bar on copyright protection for federal\nworks sweeps much more broadly than the government\nedicts doctrine does. That bar applies to works created by\nall federal \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s],\u201d without regard for the\nnature of their position or scope of their authority. What-\never policy reasons might justify the Federal Government\u2019s\ndecision to forfeit copyright protection for its own proprie-\ntary works, that federal rule does not suggest an intent to\ndisplace the much narrower government edicts doctrine\nwith respect to the States. That doctrine does not apply to\nnon-lawmaking officials, leaving States free to assert copy-\nright in the vast majority of expressive works they produce,\nsuch as those created by their universities, libraries,\ntourism offices, and so on.\n  More generally, Georgia suggests that we should resist\napplying our government edicts precedents to the OCGA\nannotations because our 19th-century forebears inter-\npreted the statutory term author by reference to \u201cpublic\npolicy\u201d\u2014an approach that Georgia believes is incongruous\nwith the \u201cmodern era\u201d of statutory interpretation.

Surely these supplementary materials do\nnot have the force of law, yet they are covered by the doc-\ntrine.

Under\nthe logic of Georgia\u2019s \u201cforce of law\u201d test, States would own\nsuch materials and could charge the public for access to\nthem.\n  Furthermore, despite Georgia\u2019s and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\npurported concern for the text of the Copyright Act, their\nconception of the government edicts doctrine has less of a\ntextual footing than the traditional formulation. The tex-\ntual basis for the doctrine is the Act\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d require-\nment, which unsurprisingly focuses on\u2014the author.\nJUSTICE THOMAS urges us to dig deeper to \u201cthe root\u201d of our\ngovernment edicts precedents.

The Court long ago interpreted the\nword \u201cauthor\u201d to exclude officials empowered to speak with\nthe force of law, and Congress has carried that meaning for-\nward in multiple iterations of the Copyright Act. This tex-\ntual foundation explains why the doctrine distinguishes be-\ntween some authors (who are empowered to speak with the\nforce of law) and others (who are not).

But the contours of the rule were\nfar from clear, and to understand the scope of the doctrine,\nwe must explore its underlying rationale.\n   In my view, the majority\u2019s uncritical extrapolation of\nprecedent is inconsistent with the judicial role. An unwill-\ningness to examine the root of a precedent has led to the\nsprouting of many noxious weeds that distort the meaning\nof the Constitution and statutes alike.

In Banks, the Court referred\nto the meaning of the term \u201cauthor\u201d in copyright law. While\nthe Court did not develop this argument, it is conceivable\nthat the contemporaneous public meaning of the term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d was narrower in the copyright context than in ordi-\nnary speech. At the time this Court decided Banks, the\nCopyright Act provided protection for books, maps, prints,\nengravings, musical and dramatic compositions, photo-\ngraphs, and works of art.1 Judicial opinions differ markedly\nfrom these works. Books, for instance, express the thoughts\nof their authors. They typically have no power beyond the\nability of their words to influence readers, and they usually\nare published at private expense. Judicial opinions, on the\nother hand, do not simply express the thoughts of the\njudges who write or endorse them. Instead, they elaborate\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See 1 Stat. 124; 2 Stat. 171; ch. 16, 4 Stat. 436; 11 Stat. 138\u2013139; 13\n\nStat. 540; 16 Stat. 212.\n\f6          GEORGIA v.

Unlike other copyright-\nable works of authorship, judicial opinions have binding le-\ngal effect, and they are produced and issued at public\nexpense. Moreover, copyright law understands an author\nto be one whose work will be encouraged by the grant of an\nexclusive right. See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,\n579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6). But judges, when\nacting in an official capacity, do not fit that description.

First, unlike judicial opinions and statutes,\nthese annotations do not even purport to embody the will of\nthe people because they are not law. The General Assembly\nof Georgia has made abundantly clear through a variety of\nprovisions that the annotations do not create any binding\nobligations. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20137 states that \u201c[a]ll historical cita-\ntions, title and chapter analyses, and notes set out in this\nCode are given for the purpose of convenient reference and\ndo not constitute part of the law.\u201d Section 1\u20131\u20131 further\nprovides that \u201c[t]he statutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws . . . is enacted and shall have the effect of stat-\nutes enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia. The stat-\nutory portion of such codification shall be merged with an-\nnotations . . . and other materials . . . and shall be published\nby authority of the state.\u201d Thus, although the materials\n\f8         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cmerge\u201d prior to publication in the \u201cofficial\u201d code, the very\nprovision calling for that merger makes clear that the an-\nnotations serve as commentary, not law.\n   As additional evidence that the annotations do not repre-\nsent the will of the people, the General Assembly does not\nenact statutory annotations under its legislative power.\nSee Ga. Const., Art. III, \u00a71, \u00b61 (vesting the legislative power\nin the General Assembly). To enact state law, Georgia em-\nploys a process of bicameralism and presentment similar to\nthat embodied in the United States Constitution. See Ga.\nConst., Art. III, \u00a75; Art. V, \u00a72, \u00b64. The annotations do not\ngo through this process, a fact that even the majority must\nacknowledge. Ante, at 10; Ga. S. 52, Reg. Sess., \u00a754(b)\n(2019\u20132020) (\u201cAnnotations . . . except as otherwise provided\nin the Code . . . are not enacted as statutes by the provisions\nof this Act\u201d).\n   Second, unlike judges and legislators, the creators of an-\nnotations are incentivized by the copyright laws to produce\na desirable product that will eventually earn them a profit.\nAnd though the Commission may require Lexis to follow\nstrict guidelines, the independent synthesis, analysis, and\ncreative drafting behind the annotations makes them anal-\nogous to other copyrightable materials. See Brief for Mat-\nthew Bender & Co., Inc., as Amicus Curiae 4\u20137.\n   Lastly, the annotations do not impede fair notice of the\nlaws. As just stated, the annotations do not carry the bind-\ning force of law. They simply summarize independent\nsources of legal information and consolidate them in one\nplace. Thus, OCGA annotations serve a similar function to\nother copyrighted research tools provided by private parties\nsuch as the American Law Reports and Westlaw, which also\ncontain information of great \u201cpractical significance.\u201d Ante,\nat 17.

Ante, at 17.\nThat is simply incorrect.

PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprecedents.3 Specifically, there are four indications in the\ntext of the Copyright Act that the OCGA annotations are\ncopyrightable. As an initial matter, the Act does not define\nthe word \u201cauthor,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7101, or make any reference\nto the government edicts doctrine. Accordingly, the term\n\u201cauthor\u201d itself does not shed any light on whether the doc-\ntrine covers statutory annotations. Second, while the Act\nexcludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s] prepared by an\nofficer or employee of the United States Government as part\nof that person\u2019s official duties,\u201d \u00a7101; see also \u00a7105, the Act\ncontains no similar prohibition against works of state gov-\nernments or works prepared at their behest. \u201cCongress\u2019 use\nof explicit language in one provision cautions against infer-\nring the same limitation\u201d elsewhere in the statute. State\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n580 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v.

Third, the Act specifi-\ncally notes that annotations are copyrightable derivative\nworks. \u00a7101. Here, again, the Act does not expressly ex-\nclude from copyright protection annotations created either\nby the State or at the State\u2019s request. Fourth, the Act pro-\nvides that an author may hold a copyright in \u201cmaterial con-\ntributed\u201d in a derivative work, \u201cas distinguished from the\npreexisting material employed in the work.\u201d \u00a7103(b); see\nalso Feist Publications, Inc. v.

These aspects of the statutory\ntext, taken together, further support the conclusion that the\nOCGA annotations are copyrightable.\n   For all these reasons, I would conclude that, as with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the majority explains, ante, at 9, the annotations were created as\n\npart of a work-for-hire agreement between the Commission and Lexis.\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7201(b).

In\nits view, the Court in Banks held that judges are not \u201cau-\nthors\u201d within the scope of the Copyright Act for \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">judges,\u201d</span> <span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at\n<span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, so the same must be true for legislators, see ante, at 8\u2013\n9. Accordingly, works created by legislators in their legis-\nlative capacity are not \u201coriginal works of authorship,\u201d \u00a7102,\nand therefore cannot be copyrighted. This argument is\nflawed in multiple respects.\n                               A\n   Most notably, the majority\u2019s textual analysis hinges on\naccepting that its construction of \u201cauthorship,\u201d i.e., all\nworks produced in a judge\u2019s or legislator\u2019s official capacity,\nwas so well established by our 19th-century precedents that\nCongress incorporated it into the multiple revisions of the\nCopyright Act. See ante, at 12\u201313. Such confidence is ques-\ntionable, to say the least.\n   The majority\u2019s understanding of the government edicts\ndoctrine seems to have been lost on dozens of States and\nTerritories, as well as the lower courts in this case. As al-\nready stated, the 25 jurisdictions with official annotated\ncodes apparently did not view this Court\u2019s precedents as es-\ntablishing the \u201cofficial duties\u201d definition of authorship. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae.4 And if\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 According to one study published in 2000, approximately half of\n\nStates owned copyright in official state statutory compilations, court re-\nports, or administrative regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of\nCopyrights in Primary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertain-\nment L. J. 81, 83, 97\u2013105 (2000). The majority attempts to undermine\nthis study by emphasizing that some of these States owned copyright in\nprimary law materials. Ante, at 13, n. 3. This misunderstands the point.\n\f12          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cour precedents answer the question\u201d so clearly, ante, at 14,\none wonders why the Eleventh Circuit reached its conclu-\nsion in such a roundabout fashion. Rather than following\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cstraightforward\u201d path, ante, at 5, the Elev-\nenth Circuit looked to the \u201czone of indeterminacy at the\nfrontier between edicts that carry the force of law and\nthose that do not\u201d to determine whether the annotations\nwere \u201csufficiently law-like\u201d to be \u201cconstructively authored\nby the People.\u201d Code Revision Comm\u2019n v.

It is risible\nto presume that Congress had knowledge of and incorpo-\nrated a \u201csettled\u201d meaning that eluded a multitude of States\nand Territories, as well as at least four Article III judges.\nAnte, at 13. Cf. Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n  This presumption of congressional knowledge also pro-\nvides the basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the anno-\ntations are not \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d See ante, at\n11\u201312 (discussing \u00a7101). Stripped of the fiction that this\nCourt\u2019s 19th-century precedents clearly demonstrated that\n\u201cauthorship\u201d encompassed all works performed as part of a\nlegislator\u2019s duties, the majority\u2019s textual argument fails.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI do not claim that this evidence demonstrates that the States neces-\nsarily interpreted the government edicts doctrine correctly. I merely\npoint out that these divergent practices seriously undercut the majority\u2019s\nclaim that its interpretation of \u201cauthorship\u201d was well settled and univer-\nsally understood. On this score, the majority has no answer but to insin-\nuate that the lawmakers of over half the Nation\u2019s jurisdictions disre-\ngarded federal law and the Constitution to pursue their own agendas in\nthe face of supposedly clear precedent.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

In-\nstead, it simply repeats, without any further elaboration,\nits unsupported conclusion that \u201c[t]he Court long ago inter-\npreted the word \u2018author\u2019 to exclude officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law, and Congress has carried that\nmeaning forward in multiple iterations of the Copyright\nAct.\u201d Ante, at 16.

The majority finds it meaningful, for instance,\nthat Banks prohibited dissents and concurrences from be-\ning copyrighted, even though they carry no legal force.\nAnte, at 15. At an elementary level, it is true that the judg-\nment is the only part of a judicial decision that has legal\neffect. But it blinks reality to ignore that every word of a\njudicial opinion\u2014whether it is a majority, a concurrence, or\na dissent\u2014expounds upon the law in ways that do not map\nneatly on to the legislative function. Setting aside sum-\nmary decisions, the reader of a judicial opinion will always\ngain critical insight into the reasoning underlying a judicial\nholding by reading all opinions in their entirety.

See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a72\u20134\u2013203(1)(c) (2019); Iowa Code \u00a74.6(3)\n(2019); Minn. Stat. \u00a7645.16(7) (2018); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a712\u20132A\u201320(C)(2)\n(2019); N. D.

Given the\ndirect role that legislative history plays in the construction of statutes in\nthese States, it is hardly clear that such States could subject their legis-\nlative histories to copyright.\n\f16          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmatter, the majority\u2019s rule will prove difficult to administer.\nAccording to one group of amici, nearly all jurisdictions\nwith annotated codes use private contractors that \u201calmost\ninvariably prepare [annotations] under the supervision of\nlegislative-branch or judicial-branch officials, including\nstate legislators or state-court judges.\u201d Brief for State of\nArkansas et al. as Amici Curiae 16\u201317. Under the major-\nity\u2019s view, any one of these commissions or counsels could\npotentially be reclassified as an \u201cadjunct to the legislature.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. But the majority\u2019s test for ascertaining the true\nnature of these commissions raises far more questions than\nit answers.\n   The majority lists a number of factors\u2014including the\nCommission\u2019s membership and funding, how the annota-\ntions become part of the OCGA, and descriptions of the\nCommission from court cases\u2014to support its conclusion\nthat the Commission is really part of the legislature. See\nante, at 9\u201310. But it does not specify whether these factors\nare exhaustive or illustrative and, if the latter, what other\nfactors may be important. The majority also does not spec-\nify whether some factors weigh more heavily than others\nwhen deciding whether to deem an oversight body a legis-\nlative adjunct.\n   And even when the majority does list concrete factors,\npivotal guidance remains lacking. For example, the major-\nity finds it meaningful that 9 out of the Commission\u2019s 15\nmembers are legislators. Ante, at 9; see OCGA \u00a728\u20139\u20132\n(noting that the other members of the Commission include\nthe State\u2019s Lieutenant Governor, a judge, a district attor-\nney, and three other state bar members). But how many\nlegislative members are needed for a commission to become\na legislative adjunct? The majority provides no answers to\nany of these questions.\n                         *     *    *\n     The majority\u2019s rule will leave in the lurch the many\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

Perhaps, to the detriment\nof all, many States will stop producing annotated codes\naltogether. Were that to occur, the majority\u2019s fear of an\n\u201ceconomy-class\u201d version of the law will truly become a real-\nity. See ante, at 17. As Georgia explains, its contract ena-\nbles the OCGA to be sold at a fraction of the cost of compet-\ning annotated codes. For example, Georgia asserts that\nLexis sold the OCGA for $404 in 2016, while West Publish-\ning\u2019s competing annotated code sold for $2,570. Should\nstate annotated codes disappear, those without the means\nto pay the competitor\u2019s significantly higher price tag will\nhave a valuable research tool taken away from them.\nMeanwhile, this Court, which is privileged to have access to\nnumerous research resources, will scarcely notice. These\nnegative practical ramifications are unfortunate enough\nwhen they reflect the deliberative legislative choices that\nwe as judges are bound to respect. They are all the more\nregrettable when they are the result of our own meddling.\nFortunately, as the majority and I agree, \u201c \u2018critics of [to-\nday\u2019s] ruling can take their objections across the street,\n[where] Congress can correct any mistake it sees.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n13 (quoting Kimble v.

The core question this\ncase presents, as I see it: Are the annotations in the Official\nCode of Georgia Annotated (OCGA) done in a legislative ca-\npacity?

The OCGA annotations, in my\nappraisal, do not rank as part of the Georgia Legislature\u2019s\nlawmaking process for three reasons.\n  First, the annotations are not created contemporaneously\nwith the statutes to which they pertain; instead, the anno-\ntations comment on statutes already enacted. See, e.g.,\nApp. 268\u2013269 (text of enacted laws are transmitted to the\npublisher for the addition of commentary);</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> at 403\u2013404\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">(publisher adds new case notes on a rolling basis as courts\nconstrue existing statutes).1 In short, annotating begins\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For example, OCGA \u00a711\u20132A\u2013213 was enacted, in its current form, in\n\n1993.

This sets the OCGA annota-\ntions apart from uncopyrightable legislative materials like\ncommittee reports, generated before a law\u2019s enactment, and\ntied tightly to the task of law-formulation.\n   Second, the OCGA annotations are descriptive rather\nthan prescriptive. Instead of stating the legislature\u2019s per-\nception of what a law conveys, the annotations summarize\nwritings in which others express their views on a given stat-\nute. For example, the OCGA contains \u201ccase annotations\u201d\nfor \u201c[a]ll decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the\nCourt of Appeals of Georgia and all decisions of the federal\ncourts in cases which arose in Georgia construing any por-\ntion of the general statutory law of the state.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 403.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">Per the Code Revision Commission\u2019s instructions, each an-\nnotation should \u201caccurately reflect the facts, holding, and\nstatutory construction\u201d adopted by the court.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 404.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">The annotations are neutrally cast; they do not opine on\nwhether the summarized case was correctly decided.

This characteristic of the annotations distin-\nguishes them from preenactment legislative materials that\ntouch or concern the correct interpretation of the legisla-\nture\u2019s work.\n   Third, and of prime importance, the OCGA annotations\nare \u201cgiven for the purpose of convenient reference\u201d by the\npublic, \u00a71\u20131\u20137 (2019); they aim to inform the citizenry at\nlarge, they do not address, particularly, those seated in leg-\nislative chambers.2 Annotations are thus unlike, for exam-\nple, surveys, work commissioned by a legislature to aid in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Suppose a committee of Georgia\u2019s legislature, to inform the public,\n\ninstructs a staffer to write a guide titled \u201cThe Workways of the Georgia\nLegislature.\u201d The final text describing how the legislature operates is\ncirculated to members of the legislature and approved by a majority.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s decision, I take it that such a work, which entails\nno lawmaking, would be copyrightable.\n\f4            GEORGIA v.

PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 18\u20131150. Argued December 2, 2019\u2014Decided April 27, 2020\nThe Copyright Act grants monopoly protection for \u201coriginal works of au-\n  thorship.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7102(a). Under the government edicts doctrine,\n  officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot be the au-\n  thors of the works they create in the course of their official duties.\n     The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the Official Code of Geor-\n  gia Annotated (OCGA). That Code includes the text of every Georgia\n  statute currently in force, as well as a set of non-binding annotations\n  that appear beneath each statutory provision. The annotations typi-\n  cally include summaries of judicial opinions construing each provision,\n  summaries of pertinent opinions of the state attorney general, and a\n  list of related law review articles and other reference materials. The\n  OCGA is assembled by the Code Revision Commission, a state entity\n  composed mostly of legislators, funded through legislative branch ap-\n  propriations, and staffed by the Office of Legislative Counsel.\n     The annotations in the current OCGA were produced by Matthew\n  Bender & Co., Inc., a division of the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a\n  work-for-hire agreement with the Commission. Under the agreement,\n  Lexis drafts the annotations under the supervision of the Commission,\n  which specifies what the annotations must include in exacting detail.\n  The agreement also states that any copyright in the OCGA vests in the\n  State of Georgia, acting through the Commission.\n     Respondent Public.Resource.Org (PRO), a nonprofit dedicated to fa-\n  cilitating public access to government records and legal materials,\n  posted the OCGA online and distributed copies to various organiza-\n  tions and Georgia officials. After sending PRO several cease-and-de-\n  sist letters, the Commission sued PRO for infringing its copyright in\n  the OCGA annotations. PRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory\n  judgment that the entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\n\f2             GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    public domain. The District Court sided with the Commission, holding\n    that the annotations were eligible for copyright protection because\n    they had not been enacted into law. The Eleventh Circuit reversed,\n    rejecting the Commission\u2019s copyright assertion under the government\n    edicts doctrine.\nHeld: The OCGA annotations are ineligible for copyright protection.\n Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The government edicts doctrine developed from a trio of 19th-\n century cases. In Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, the Court held that no\n reporter can have a copyright in the Court\u2019s opinions and that the Jus-\n tices cannot confer such a right on any reporter. In Banks v. Manches-\n ter, 128 U. S. 244, the Court held that judges could not assert copyright\n in \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity as judges\u201d\u2014be it \u201cthe\n opinion or decision, the statement of the case and the syllabus or the\n head note.\u201d Id., at 253. Finally, in Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617,\n the Court reiterated that an official reporter cannot hold a copyright\n interest in opinions created by judges. But, confronting an issue not\n addressed in Wheaton or Banks, the Court upheld the reporter\u2019s copy-\n right interest in several explanatory materials that the reporter had\n created himself because they came from an author who had no author-\n ity to speak with the force of law.\n    The animating principle behind the government edicts doctrine is\n that no one can own the law. The doctrine gives effect to that principle\n in the copyright context through construction of the statutory term\n \u201cauthor.\u201d For purposes of the Copyright Act, judges cannot be the \u201cau-\n thor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity\u201d as lawmak-\n ers. Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. Because legislators, like judges, have\n the authority to make law, it follows that they, too, cannot be \u201cau-\n thors.\u201d And, as with judges, the doctrine applies to whatever work\n legislators perform in their capacity as legislators, including explana-\n tory and procedural materials they create in the discharge of their leg-\n islative duties. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not copy-\n rightable. First, the author of the annotations qualifies as a legislator.\n Under the Copyright Act, the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the annotations is the\n Commission, 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b), which functions as an arm of the\n Georgia Legislature in producing the annotations. Second, the Com-\n mission creates the annotations in the discharge of its legislative du-\n ties. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (c) Georgia argues that excluding the OCGA annotations from copy-\n right protection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. First, it\n notes that \u00a7101 lists \u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible\n for copyright protection. That provision, however, refers only to \u201can-\n notations . . . which . . . represent an original work of authorship.\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (Emphasis added.) Georgia\u2019s annotations do not fit that description\n  because they are prepared by a legislative body that cannot be deemed\n  the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works it creates in its official capacity. Second,\n  Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact that the Act excludes\n  from copyright protection works prepared by Federal Government of-\n  ficials, without establishing a similar rule for State officials. \u00a7\u00a7101,\n  105. That rule, however, applies to all federal officials, regardless of\n  the nature and scope of their duties. It does not suggest an intent to\n  displace the much narrower government edicts doctrine with respect\n  to the States.\n     Moving on from the text, Georgia invokes what it views as the offi-\n  cial position of the Copyright Office, as reflected in the Compendium\n  of U. S. Copyright Office Practices. The Compendium, however, is a\n  non-binding administrative manual and is largely consistent with this\n  Court\u2019s position. Georgia also appeals to copyright policy, but such\n  requests should be addressed to Congress, not the courts.\n     Georgia attempts to frame the government edicts doctrine to focus\n  exclusively on whether a particular work has the force of law. But that\n  understanding cannot be squared with precedent\u2014especially Banks.\n  Moreover, Georgia\u2019s conception of the doctrine as distinguishing be-\n  tween different categories of content with different effects has less of\n  a textual footing than the traditional formulation, which focuses on the\n  identity of the author. Georgia\u2019s characterization of the OCGA anno-\n  tations as non-binding and non-authoritative undersells the practical\n  significance of the annotations to litigants and citizens. And its ap-\n  proach would logically permit States to hide all non-binding judicial\n  and legislative work product\u2014including dissents and legislative his-\n  tory\u2014behind a paywall.

S. C.\n\u00a7102(a). The question in this case is whether that protec-\ntion extends to the annotations contained in Georgia\u2019s\nofficial annotated code.\n   We hold that it does not. Over a century ago, we recog-\nnized a limitation on copyright protection for certain\ngovernment work product, rooted in the Copyright Act\u2019s\n\u201cauthorship\u201d requirement. Under what has been dubbed\nthe government edicts doctrine, officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law cannot be the authors of\u2014and\ntherefore cannot copyright\u2014the works they create in the\ncourse of their official duties.\n   We have previously applied that doctrine to hold that\nnon-binding, explanatory legal materials are not copyright-\nable when created by judges who possess the authority to\nmake and interpret the law. See Banks v. Manchester, 128\nU. S. 244 (1888). We now recognize that the same logic ap-\nplies to non-binding, explanatory legal materials created by\n\f2         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na legislative body vested with the authority to make law.\nBecause Georgia\u2019s annotations are authored by an arm\nof the legislature in the course of its legislative duties, the\ngovernment edicts doctrine puts them outside the reach of\ncopyright protection.\n                              I\n                              A\n   The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the \u201cOfficial\nCode of Georgia Annotated,\u201d or OCGA. The first page of\neach volume of the OCGA boasts the State\u2019s official seal and\nannounces to readers that it is \u201cPublished Under Authority\nof the State.\u201d\n   The OCGA includes the text of every Georgia statute\ncurrently in force, as well as various non-binding supple-\nmentary materials. At issue in this case is a set of annota-\ntions that appear beneath each statutory provision. The\nannotations generally include summaries of judicial deci-\nsions applying a given provision, summaries of any perti-\nnent opinions of the state attorney general, and a list of re-\nlated law review articles and similar reference materials.\nIn addition, the annotations often include editor\u2019s notes\nthat provide information about the origins of the statutory\ntext, such as whether it derives from a particular judicial\ndecision or resembles an older provision that has been con-\nstrued by Georgia courts. See, e.g., OCGA \u00a7\u00a751\u20131\u20131, 53\u20134\u2013\n2 (2019).\n   The OCGA is assembled by a state entity called the Code\nRevision Commission. In 1977, the Georgia Legislature\nestablished the Commission to recodify Georgia law for the\nfirst time in decades. The Commission was (and remains)\ntasked with consolidating disparate bills into a single Code\nfor reenactment by the legislature and contracting with a\nthird party to produce the annotations. A majority of the\nCommission\u2019s 15 members must be members of the Georgia\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Code Revision Comm\u2019n, 244 Ga. 325, 330, 260 S. E.\n2d 30, 34 (1979).\n   Each year, the Commission submits its proposed statu-\ntory text and accompanying annotations to the legislature\nfor approval. The legislature then votes to do three things:\n(1) \u201cenact[ ]\u201d the \u201cstatutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws\u201d; (2) \u201cmerge[ ]\u201d the statutory portion \u201cwith\n[the] annotations\u201d; and (3) \u201cpublish[ ]\u201d the final merged\nproduct \u201cby authority of the state\u201d as \u201cthe \u2018Official Code\nof Georgia Annotated.\u2019 \u201d OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20131 (2019); see Code\nRevision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 906 F. 3d\n1229, 1245, 1255 (CA11 2018); Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\n   The annotations in the current OCGA were prepared in\nthe first instance by Matthew Bender & Co., Inc., a division\nof the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a work-for-hire agree-\nment with the Commission. The agreement between Lexis\nand the Commission states that any copyright in the OCGA\nvests exclusively in \u201cthe State of Georgia, acting through\nthe Commission.\u201d App. 567. Lexis and its army of research-\ners perform the lion\u2019s share of the work in drafting the an-\nnotations, but the Commission supervises that work and\nspecifies what the annotations must include in exacting de-\ntail. See 906 F. 3d, at 1243\u20131244; App. 269\u2013278, 286\u2013427\n(Commission specifications). Under the agreement, Lexis\nenjoys the exclusive right to publish, distribute, and sell the\nOCGA.

Without permission, PRO posted a dig-\nital version of the OCGA on various websites, where it could\nbe downloaded by the public without charge. PRO also\ndistributed copies of the OCGA to various organizations\nand Georgia officials.\n   In response, the Commission sent PRO several cease-\nand-desist letters asserting that PRO\u2019s actions constituted\nunlawful copyright infringement. When PRO refused to\nhalt its distribution activities, the Commission sued PRO\non behalf of the Georgia Legislature and the State of Geor-\ngia for copyright infringement. The Commission limited its\nassertion of copyright to the annotations described above; it\ndid not claim copyright in the statutory text or numbering.\nPRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\npublic domain.\n   The District Court sided with the Commission. The\nCourt acknowledged that the annotations in the OCGA pre-\nsented \u201can unusual case because most official codes are not\nannotated and most annotated codes are not official.\u201d Code\nRevision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 244 F. Supp.\n3d 1350, 1356 (ND Ga. 2017). But, ultimately, the Court\nconcluded that the annotations were eligible for copyright\nprotection because they were \u201cnot enacted into law\u201d and\nlacked \u201cthe force of law.\u201d Ibid. In light of that conclusion,\nthe Court granted partial summary judgment to the Com-\nmission and entered a permanent injunction requiring PRO\nto cease its distribution activities and to remove the digital\ncopies of the OCGA from the internet.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Eleventh Circuit reversed. 906 F. 3d 1229. The\nCourt began by reviewing the three 19th-century cases in\nwhich we articulated the government edicts doctrine. See\nWheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834); Banks v. Manchester,\n128 U. S. 244 (1888); Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617\n(1888). The Court understood those cases to establish a\n\u201crule\u201d based on an interpretation of the statutory term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d that \u201cworks created by courts in the performance of\ntheir official duties did not belong to the judges\u201d but instead\nfell \u201cin the public domain.\u201d 906 F. 3d, at 1239. In the\nCourt\u2019s view, that rule \u201cderive[s] from first principles about\nthe nature of law in our democracy.\u201d Ibid. In a democracy,\nthe Court reasoned, \u201cthe People\u201d are \u201cthe constructive au-\nthors\u201d of the law, and judges and legislators are merely\n\u201cdraftsmen . . . exercising delegated authority.\u201d Ibid. The\nCourt therefore deemed the \u201cultimate inquiry\u201d to be\nwhether a work is \u201cattributable to the constructive author-\nship of the People.\u201d Id., at 1242. The Court identified three\nfactors to guide that inquiry: \u201cthe identity of the public offi-\ncial who created the work; the nature of the work; and the\nprocess by which the work was produced.\u201d Id., at 1254. The\nCourt found that each of those factors cut in favor of treat-\ning the OCGA annotations as government edicts authored\nby the People. It therefore rejected the Commission\u2019s asser-\ntion of copyright, vacated the injunction against PRO, and\ndirected that judgment be entered for PRO.\n   We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___ (2019).\n                             II\n  We hold that the annotations in Georgia\u2019s Official Code\nare ineligible for copyright protection, though for reasons\ndistinct from those relied on by the Court of Appeals. A\ncareful examination of our government edicts precedents\nreveals a straightforward rule based on the identity of the\nauthor. Under the government edicts doctrine, judges\u2014\nand, we now confirm, legislators\u2014may not be considered\n\f6         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe \u201cauthors\u201d of the works they produce in the course of\ntheir official duties as judges and legislators. That rule\napplies regardless of whether a given material carries the\nforce of law. And it applies to the annotations here because\nthey are authored by an arm of the legislature in the course\nof its official duties.\n                               A\n   We begin with precedent. The government edicts doc-\ntrine traces back to a trio of cases decided in the 19th cen-\ntury. In this Court\u2019s first copyright case, Wheaton v. Peters,\n8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court\u2019s third Reporter of Decisions,\nWheaton, sued the fourth, Peters, unsuccessfully asserting\na copyright interest in the Justices\u2019 opinions. Id., at 617\n(argument). In Wheaton\u2019s view, the opinions \u201cmust have\nbelonged to some one\u201d because \u201cthey were new, original,\u201d\nand much more \u201celaborate\u201d than law or custom required.\nId., at 615. Wheaton argued that the Justices were the au-\nthors and had assigned their ownership interests to him\nthrough a tacit \u201cgift.\u201d Id., at 614. The Court unanimously\nrejected that argument, concluding that \u201cno reporter has or\ncan have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by\nthis court\u201d and that \u201cthe judges thereof cannot confer on\nany reporter any such right.\u201d Id., at 668 (opinion).\n   That conclusion apparently seemed too obvious to adorn\nwith further explanation, but the Court provided one a half\ncentury later in Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244 (1888).\nThat case concerned whether Wheaton\u2019s state-court coun-\nterpart, the official reporter of the Ohio Supreme Court,\nheld a copyright in the judges\u2019 opinions and several non-\nbinding explanatory materials prepared by the judges. Id.,\nat 249\u2013251. The Court concluded that he did not, explain-\ning that \u201cthe judge who, in his judicial capacity, prepares\nthe opinion or decision, the statement of the case and the\nsyllabus or head note\u201d cannot \u201cbe regarded as their author\nor their proprietor, in the sense of [the Copyright Act].\u201d Id.,\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 253. Pursuant to \u201ca judicial consensus\u201d dating back to\nWheaton, judges could not assert copyright in \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as judges.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S, at 253 (emphasis in original). Rather, \u201c[t]he whole\nwork done by the judges constitutes the authentic exposi-\ntion and interpretation of the law, which, binding every\ncitizen, is free for publication to all.\u201d Ibid. (citing Nash v.\nLathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 6 N. E. 559 (1886)).\n   In a companion case decided later that Term, Callaghan\nv. Myers, 128 U. S. 617 (1888), the Court identified an im-\nportant limiting principle. As in Wheaton and Banks,\nthe Court rejected the claim that an official reporter held a\ncopyright interest in the judges\u2019 opinions. But, resolving an\nissue not addressed in Wheaton and Banks, the Court up-\nheld the reporter\u2019s copyright interest in several explanatory\nmaterials that the reporter had created himself: headnotes,\nsyllabi, tables of contents, and the like. Callaghan, 128\nU. S., at 645, 647. Although these works mirrored the\njudge-made materials rejected in Banks, they came from an\nauthor who had no authority to speak with the force of law.\nBecause the reporter was not a judge, he was free to \u201cob-\ntain[ ] a copyright\u201d for the materials that were \u201cthe result\nof his [own] intellectual labor.\u201d 128 U. S., at 647.\n   These cases establish a straightforward rule: Because\njudges are vested with the authority to make and interpret\nthe law, they cannot be the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works they pre-\npare \u201cin the discharge of their judicial duties.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S., at 253. This rule applies both to binding works (such\nas opinions) and to non-binding works (such as headnotes\nand syllabi). Ibid. It does not apply, however, to works cre-\nated by government officials (or private parties) who lack\nthe authority to make or interpret the law, such as court\nreporters. Compare ibid. with Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 647.\n   The animating principle behind this rule is that no one\ncan own the law. \u201cEvery citizen is presumed to know the\nlaw,\u201d and \u201cit needs no argument to show . . . that all should\n\f8           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhave free access\u201d to its contents. Nash, 142 Mass., at 35, 6\nN. E., at 560 (cited by Banks, 128 U. S., at 253\u2013254). Our\ncases give effect to that principle in the copyright context\nthrough construction of the statutory term \u201cauthor.\u201d Id., at\n253.1 Rather than attempting to catalog the materials\nthat constitute \u201cthe law,\u201d the doctrine bars the officials\nresponsible for creating the law from being considered the\n\u201cauthor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capac-\nity\u201d as lawmakers. Ibid. (emphasis added). Because these\nofficials are generally empowered to make and interpret\nlaw, their \u201cwhole work\u201d is deemed part of the \u201cauthentic ex-\nposition and interpretation of the law\u201d and must be \u201cfree for\npublication to all.\u201d Ibid.\n   If judges, acting as judges, cannot be \u201cauthors\u201d because of\ntheir authority to make and interpret the law, it follows\nthat legislators, acting as legislators, cannot be either.\nCourts have thus long understood the government edicts\ndoctrine to apply to legislative materials. See, e.g., Nash,\n142 Mass., at 35, 6 N. E., at 560 (judicial opinions and stat-\nutes stand \u201con substantially the same footing\u201d for purposes\nof the government edicts doctrine); Howell v. Miller, 91 F.\n129, 130\u2013131, 137\u2013138 (CA6 1898) (Harlan, J., Circuit Jus-\ntice, joined by then-Circuit Judge Taft) (analyzing statutes\nand supplementary materials under Banks and Callaghan\nand concluding that the materials were copyrightable be-\ncause they were prepared by a private compiler).\n   Moreover, just as the doctrine applies to \u201cwhatever work\n[judges] perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d Banks, 128\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Copyright Act of 1790 granted copyright protection to \u201cthe author\n\nand authors\u201d of qualifying works. Act of May 31, 1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 124.\nThis author requirement appears in the current Copyright Act at\n\u00a7102(a), which limits protection to \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d 17\nU. S. C. \u00a7102(a) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7201(a) (copyright \u201cvests ini-\ntially in the author or authors of the work\u201d).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 253, it applies to whatever work legislators per-\nform in their capacity as legislators. That of course includes\nfinal legislation, but it also includes explanatory and proce-\ndural materials legislators create in the discharge of their\nlegislative duties. In the same way that judges cannot be\nthe authors of their headnotes and syllabi, legislators can-\nnot be the authors of (for example) their floor statements,\ncommittee reports, and proposed bills. These materials are\npart of the \u201cwhole work done by [legislators],\u201d so they must\nbe \u201cfree for publication to all.\u201d Ibid.\n   Under our precedents, therefore, copyright does not vest\nin works that are (1) created by judges and legislators (2) in\nthe course of their judicial and legislative duties.\n                              B\n                              1\n   Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not\ncopyrightable. The first step is to examine whether their\npurported author qualifies as a legislator.\n   As we have explained, the annotations were prepared in\nthe first instance by a private company (Lexis) pursuant to\na work-for-hire agreement with Georgia\u2019s Code Revision\nCommission. The Copyright Act therefore deems the Com-\nmission the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the work. 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b).\nAlthough Lexis expends considerable effort preparing the\nannotations, for purposes of copyright that labor redounds\nto the Commission as the statutory author. Georgia agrees\nthat the author is the Commission. Brief for Petitioners 25.\n   The Commission is not identical to the Georgia Legisla-\nture, but functions as an arm of it for the purpose of produc-\ning the annotations. The Commission is created by the leg-\nislature, for the legislature, and consists largely of\nlegislators. The Commission receives funding and staff des-\nignated by law for the legislative branch. Significantly, the\nannotations the Commission creates are approved by the\nlegislature before being \u201cmerged\u201d with the statutory text\n\f10           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand published in the official code alongside that text at the\nlegislature\u2019s direction. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20131; see 906 F. 3d, at\n1245, 1255; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\n   If there were any doubt about the link between the Com-\nmission and the legislature, the Georgia Supreme Court\nhas dispelled it by holding that, under the Georgia Consti-\ntution, \u201cthe work of the Commission; i.e., selecting a pub-\nlisher and contracting for and supervising the codification\nof the laws enacted by the General Assembly, including\ncourt interpretations thereof, is within the sphere of legisla-\ntive authority.\u201d Harrison Co., 244 Ga., at 330, 260 S. E. 2d,\nat 34 (emphasis added). That holding is not limited to the\nCommission\u2019s role in codifying the statutory text. The Com-\nmission\u2019s \u201clegislative authority\u201d specifically includes its\n\u201ccodification of . . . court interpretations\u201d of the State\u2019s laws.\nIbid. Thus, as a matter of state law, the Commission wields\nthe legislature\u2019s authority when it works with Lexis to pro-\nduce the annotations. All of this shows that the Commis-\nsion serves as an extension of the Georgia Legislature in\npreparing and publishing the annotations. And it helps\nexplain why the Commission brought this suit asserting\ncopyright in the annotations \u201con behalf of and for the\nbenefit of \u201d the Georgia Legislature and the State of\nGeorgia. App. 20.2\n                             2\n  The second step is to determine whether the Commission\ncreates the annotations in the \u201cdischarge\u201d of its legislative\n\u201cduties.\u201d Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. It does. Although the\nannotations are not enacted into law through bicameralism\nand presentment, the Commission\u2019s preparation of the an-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE THOMAS does not dispute that the Commission is an exten-\n\nsion of the legislature; he instead faults us for highlighting the multiple\nfeatures of the Commission that make clear that this is so. See post, at\n16 (dissenting opinion).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotations is under Georgia law an act of \u201clegislative author-\nity,\u201d Harrison Co., 244 Ga., at 330, 260 S. E. 2d, at 34, and\nthe annotations provide commentary and resources that the\nlegislature has deemed relevant to understanding its laws.\nGeorgia and JUSTICE GINSBURG emphasize that the anno-\ntations do not purport to provide authoritative explanations\nof the law and largely summarize other materials, such as\njudicial decisions and law review articles. See post, at 3\u20134\n(dissenting opinion). But that does not take them outside\nthe exercise of legislative duty by the Commission and leg-\nislature. Just as we have held that the \u201cstatement of the\ncase and the syllabus or head note\u201d prepared by judges fall\nwithin the \u201cwork they perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d\nBanks, 128 U. S., at 253, so too annotations published by\nlegislators alongside the statutory text fall within the work\nlegislators perform in their capacity as legislators.\n   In light of the Commission\u2019s role as an adjunct to the leg-\nislature and the fact that the Commission authors the\nannotations in the course of its legislative responsibilities,\nthe annotations in Georgia\u2019s Official Code fall within the\ngovernment edicts doctrine and are not copyrightable.\n                               III\n   Georgia resists this conclusion on several grounds. At the\noutset, Georgia advances two arguments for why, in its\nview, excluding the OCGA annotations from copyright\nprotection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. Both\nare unavailing.\n   First, Georgia notes that \u00a7101 of the Act specifically lists\n\u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible for copy-\nright protection. But that provision refers only to \u201cannota-\ntions . . . which . . . represent an original work of author-\nship.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7101 (emphasis added). The whole point\nof the government edicts doctrine is that judges and legis-\nlators cannot serve as authors when they produce works in\ntheir official capacity. While the reference to \u201cannotations\u201d\n\f12        GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin \u00a7101 may help explain why supplemental, explanatory\nmaterials are copyrightable when prepared by a private\nparty, or a non-lawmaking official like the reporter in Cal-\nlaghan, it does not speak to whether those same materials\nare copyrightable when prepared by a judge or a legislator.\nIn the same way that judicial materials are ineligible for\nprotection even though they plainly qualify as \u201c[l]iterary\nworks . . . expressed in words,\u201d ibid., legislative materials\nare ineligible for protection even if they happen to fit the\ndescription of otherwise copyrightable \u201cannotations.\u201d\n  Second, Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact\nthat the Act excludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s]\nprepared by an officer or employee of the United States\nGovernment as part of that person\u2019s official duties\u201d and\ndoes not establish a similar rule for the States. \u00a7101; see\nalso \u00a7105. But the bar on copyright protection for federal\nworks sweeps much more broadly than the government\nedicts doctrine does. That bar applies to works created by\nall federal \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s],\u201d without regard for the\nnature of their position or scope of their authority. What-\never policy reasons might justify the Federal Government\u2019s\ndecision to forfeit copyright protection for its own proprie-\ntary works, that federal rule does not suggest an intent to\ndisplace the much narrower government edicts doctrine\nwith respect to the States. That doctrine does not apply to\nnon-lawmaking officials, leaving States free to assert copy-\nright in the vast majority of expressive works they produce,\nsuch as those created by their universities, libraries,\ntourism offices, and so on.\n  More generally, Georgia suggests that we should resist\napplying our government edicts precedents to the OCGA\nannotations because our 19th-century forebears inter-\npreted the statutory term author by reference to \u201cpublic\npolicy\u201d\u2014an approach that Georgia believes is incongruous\nwith the \u201cmodern era\u201d of statutory interpretation.

United States, 335 U. S. 1, 16 (1948)). A century of cases\nhave rooted the government edicts doctrine in the word \u201cau-\nthor,\u201d and Congress has repeatedly reused that term with-\nout abrogating the doctrine. The term now carries this\nsettled meaning, and \u201ccritics of our ruling can take their\nobjections across the street, [where] Congress can correct\nany mistake it sees.\u201d Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment,\nLLC, 576 U.

Copyright Office Practices\n(Compendium). But, as Georgia concedes, the Compen-\ndium is a non-binding administrative manual that at most\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE THOMAS disputes the applicability of the Helsinn Healthcare\n\npresumption because States have asserted copyright in statutory anno-\ntations over the years notwithstanding our government edicts prece-\ndents. Post, at 11\u201312. In JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s view, those assertions prove\nthat our precedents could not have provided clear enough guidance for\nCongress to incorporate. But that inference from state behavior proves\ntoo much. The same study cited by JUSTICE THOMAS to support a practice\nof claiming copyright in non-binding annotations also reports that \u201cmany\nstates claim copyright interest in their primary law materials,\u201d including\nstatutes and regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of Copyrights in\nPrimary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertainment L. J. 81, 109\n(2000) (emphasis added). JUSTICE THOMAS concedes that such assertions\nare plainly foreclosed by our government edicts precedents. Post, at 4.\nThat interested parties have pursued ambitious readings of our prece-\ndents does not mean those precedents are incapable of providing mean-\ningful guidance to us or to Congress.\n\f14         GEORGIA v.

That means we must follow it only to the extent\nit has the \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d Id., at 140. Because our\nprecedents answer the question before us, we find any com-\npeting guidance in the Compendium unpersuasive.\n   In any event, the Compendium is largely consistent with\nour decision. Drawing on Banks, it states that, \u201c[a]s a mat-\nter of longstanding public policy, the U. S. Copyright Office\nwill not register a government edict that has been issued by\nany state, local, or territorial government, including legis-\nlative enactments, judicial decisions, administrative rul-\nings, public ordinances, or similar types of official legal ma-\nterials.\u201d Compendium \u00a7313.6(C)(2) (rev. 3d ed. 2017)\n(emphasis added). And, under Banks, what counts as a\n\u201csimilar\u201d material depends on what kind of officer created\nthe material (i.e., a judge) and whether the officer created\nit in the course of official (i.e., judicial) duties. See Compen-\ndium \u00a7313.6(C)(2) (quoting Banks, 128 U. S., at 253, for the\nproposition that copyright cannot vest \u201cin the products of\nthe labor done by judicial officers in the discharge of their\njudicial duties\u201d).\n   The Compendium goes on to observe that \u201cthe Office may\nregister annotations that summarize or comment upon\nlegal materials . . . unless the annotations themselves have\nthe force of law.\u201d Compendium \u00a7313.6(C)(2). But that\nbroad statement\u2014true of annotations created by officials\nsuch as court reporters that lack the authority to make or\ninterpret the law\u2014does not engage with the critical issue of\nannotations created by judges or legislators in their official\ncapacities. Because the Compendium does not address that\nquestion and otherwise echoes our government edicts prec-\nedents, it is of little relevance here.\n   Georgia also appeals to the overall purpose of the Copy-\nright Act to promote the creation and dissemination of\ncreative works.

That\nappeal to copyright policy, however, is addressed to the\nwrong forum. As Georgia acknowledges, \u201c[I]t is generally\nfor Congress, not the courts, to decide how best to pursue\nthe Copyright Clause\u2019s objectives.\u201d Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537\nU. S. 186, 212 (2003). And that principle requires adher-\nence to precedent when, as here, we have construed the\nstatutory text and \u201ctossed [the ball] into Congress\u2019s court,\nfor acceptance or not as that branch elects.\u201d Kimble, 576\nU.

JUSTICE THOMAS\nappears to endorse the same view. See post, at 4. But that\nframing has multiple flaws.\n   Most obviously, it cannot be squared with the reasoning\nor results of our cases\u2014especially Banks. Banks, following\nWheaton and the \u201cjudicial consensus\u201d it inspired, denied\ncopyright protection to judicial opinions without excepting\nconcurrences and dissents that carry no legal force. 128\nU.

As every judge learns the\nhard way, \u201ccomments in [a] dissenting opinion\u201d about legal\nprinciples and precedents \u201care just that: comments in a dis-\nsenting opinion.\u201d Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449\nU. S. 166, 177, n. 10 (1980). Yet such comments are covered\nby the government edicts doctrine because they come from\nan official with authority to make and interpret the law.\n   Indeed, Banks went even further and withheld copyright\nprotection from headnotes and syllabi produced by judges.\n128 U. S., at 253. Surely these supplementary materials do\nnot have the force of law, yet they are covered by the doc-\ntrine. The simplest explanation is the one Banks provided:\nThese non-binding works are not copyrightable because of\nwho creates them\u2014judges acting in their judicial capacity.\n\f16           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nSee ibid.\n  The same goes for non-binding legislative materials pro-\nduced by legislative bodies acting in a legislative capacity.\nThere is a broad array of such works ranging from floor\nstatements to proposed bills to committee reports. Under\nthe logic of Georgia\u2019s \u201cforce of law\u201d test, States would own\nsuch materials and could charge the public for access to\nthem.\n  Furthermore, despite Georgia\u2019s and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\npurported concern for the text of the Copyright Act, their\nconception of the government edicts doctrine has less of a\ntextual footing than the traditional formulation. The tex-\ntual basis for the doctrine is the Act\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d require-\nment, which unsurprisingly focuses on\u2014the author.\nJUSTICE THOMAS urges us to dig deeper to \u201cthe root\u201d of our\ngovernment edicts precedents. Post, at 5. But, in our view,\nthe text is the root. The Court long ago interpreted the\nword \u201cauthor\u201d to exclude officials empowered to speak with\nthe force of law, and Congress has carried that meaning for-\nward in multiple iterations of the Copyright Act. This tex-\ntual foundation explains why the doctrine distinguishes be-\ntween some authors (who are empowered to speak with the\nforce of law) and others (who are not). Compare Callaghan,\n128 U. S., at 647, with Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. But the\nAct\u2019s reference to \u201cauthorship\u201d provides no basis for Geor-\ngia\u2019s rule distinguishing between different categories of\ncontent with different effects.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Instead of accepting our predecessors\u2019 textual reasoning at face value,\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS conjures a trinity of alternative \u201corigin[s] and justifica-\ntion[s]\u201d for the government edicts doctrine that the Court might have had\nin mind. See post, at 5\u20137. Without committing to one or all of these\npossibilities, JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that each would yield a rule that\nrequires federal courts to pick out the subset of judicial and legislative\nmaterials that independently carry the force of law. But a Court moti-\nvated by JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s three-fold concerns might just as easily have\nread them as supporting a rule that prevents the officials responsible for\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Imagine a Georgia citizen in-\nterested in learning his legal rights and duties. If he reads\nthe economy-class version of the Georgia Code available\nonline, he will see laws requiring political candidates to pay\nhefty qualification fees (with no indigency exception), crim-\ninalizing broad categories of consensual sexual conduct,\nand exempting certain key evidence in criminal trials\nfrom standard evidentiary limitations\u2014with no hint\nthat important aspects of those laws have been held uncon-\nstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court. See OCGA\n\u00a7\u00a721\u20132\u2013131, 16\u20136\u20132, 16\u20136\u201318, 16\u201315\u20139 (available at\nwww.legis.ga.gov). Meanwhile, first-class readers with\naccess to the annotations will be assured that these laws\nare, in crucial respects, unenforceable relics that the legis-\nlature has not bothered to narrow or repeal. See \u00a7\u00a721\u20132\u2013\n131, 16\u20136\u20132, 16\u20136\u201318, 16\u201315\u20139 (available at https://store.\nlexisnexis.com/products/official-code-of-georgia-annotated-\nskuSKU6647 for $412.00).\n   If everything short of statutes and opinions were copy-\nrightable, then States would be free to offer a whole range\nof premium legal works for those who can afford the extra\nbenefit. A State could monetize its entire suite of legislative\nhistory. With today\u2019s digital tools, States might even\nlaunch a subscription or pay-per-law service.\n   There is no need to assume inventive or nefarious behav-\nior for these concerns to become a reality. Unlike other\nforms of intellectual property, copyright protection is both\ninstant and automatic. It vests as soon as a work is cap-\ntured in a tangible form, triggering a panoply of exclusive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncreating binding materials from qualifying as an \u201cauthor.\u201d Regardless,\nit is more \u201c[ ]consistent with the judicial role\u201d to apply the reasoning and\nresults the Court voted on and committed to writing than to speculate\nabout what practical considerations our predecessors \u201cmay have had\n. . . in mind,\u201d what history \u201cmay [have] suggest[ed],\u201d or what constitu-\ntional concerns \u201cmay have animated\u201d our government edicts precedents.\nIbid.\n\f18        GEORGIA v.

If Georgia were correct, then unless a State took the\naffirmative step of transferring its copyrights to the public\ndomain, all of its judges\u2019 and legislators\u2019 non-binding legal\nworks would be copyrighted.

But that defense, designed to\naccommodate First Amendment concerns, is notoriously\nfact sensitive and often cannot be resolved without a trial.\nCf. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises,\n471 U. S. 539, 552, 560\u2013561 (1985). The less bold among us\nwould have to think twice before using official legal works\nthat illuminate the law we are all presumed to know and\nunderstand.\n  Thankfully, there is a clear path forward that avoids\nthese concerns\u2014the one we are already on. Instead of ex-\namining whether given material carries \u201cthe force of law,\u201d\nwe ask only whether the author of the work is a judge or a\nlegislator. If so, then whatever work that judge or legislator\nproduces in the course of his judicial or legislative duties is\nnot copyrightable. That is the framework our precedents\nlong ago established, and we adhere to those precedents\ntoday.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\nEleventh Circuit.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

And, after straining to conclude\nthat the Georgia Code Revision Commission (Commission)\nis an arm of the Georgia Legislature, ante, at 9\u201310, the ma-\njority concludes that Georgia cannot hold a copyright in the\nannotations that are included as part of the Official Code of\nGeorgia Annotated (OCGA). This ruling will likely come as\na shock to the 25 other jurisdictions\u201422 States, 2 Territo-\nries, and the District of Columbia\u2014that rely on arrange-\nments similar to Georgia\u2019s to produce annotated codes. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae 15, and\nApp. to id., at 1. Perhaps these jurisdictions all overlooked\nthis Court\u2019s purportedly clear guidance. Or perhaps the\nwidespread use of these arrangements indicates that to-\nday\u2019s decision extends the government edicts doctrine to a\nnew context, rather than simply \u201cconfirm[ing]\u201d what the\nprecedents have always held.

Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court first\nregarded it as self-evident that judicial opinions cannot be\ncopyrighted either by the judges who signed them or by a\nreporter under whose auspices they are published. Con-\ngress provided that, in return for a salary of $1,000, the Re-\nporter of Decisions for this Court would prepare reports\nconsisting of judicial opinions and additional materials\nsummarizing the cases. Id., at 614, 617 (argument).\nWheaton, one of this Court\u2019s earliest Reporters, argued that\nhe owned a copyright for the entirety of his reports. He con-\ntended that he had \u201cacquired the right to the opinions by\njudges\u2019 gift\u201d once they became a part of his volume. Id., at\n614 (same). The Court ultimately remanded on the ques-\ntion whether Wheaton had complied with the Copyright\nAct\u2019s procedural requirements. Id., at 667\u2013668. In doing\nso, it observed in dicta that \u201cthe court [was] unanimously of\n[the] opinion, that no reporter has or can have any copy-\nright in the written opinions delivered by this court; and\nthat the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any\nsuch right.\u201d Id., at 668.\n   Fifty-four years later, the Court returned to the same\nsubject, suggesting a doctrinal basis for the rule that judi-\ncial opinions and certain closely related materials cannot be\ncopyrighted. In Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244 (1888),\nthe state-authorized publisher of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecisions, Banks & Brothers, sued a competing publisher\nfor copyright infringement. The competing publisher repro-\nduced portions from Banks\u2019 reports, including Ohio Su-\npreme Court decisions, statements of the cases, and syllabi,\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

This Court held that these materials were\nnot the proper subject of copyright. In reaching that con-\nclusion, the Court grounded its analysis in its interpreta-\ntion of the word \u201cauthor\u201d in the Copyright Act. It anchored\nthis interpretation in the \u201cpublic policy\u201d that \u201cthe judge\nwho, in his judicial capacity, prepares the opinion or deci-\nsion [and other materials]\u201d is not \u201cregarded as their author\nor their proprietor, in the sense of [the Copyright Act], so as\nto be able to confer any title by assignment.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S., at 253. The Court supported this conclusion by stat-\ning that \u201cthere has always been a judicial consensus . . .\nthat no copyright could[,] under the statutes passed by Con-\ngress, be secured in the products of the labor done by judi-\ncial officers in the discharge of their judicial duties.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis deleted). And the Court observed that this rule\nreflected the view that the \u201cauthentic exposition and inter-\npretation of the law . . . is free for publication to all,\u201d which\nin turn prevents a judge from qualifying as an author. Ibid.\n   Importantly, the Court also briefly discussed whether the\nState of Ohio could directly hold the copyright. In answer-\ning this question, the Court did not suggest that States\nwere categorically prohibited from holding copyrights as\nauthors or assignees. Instead, the Court simply noted that\nthe State fell outside the scope of the Act because it was not\na \u201cresident\u201d or \u201ccitizen of the United States,\u201d as then re-\nquired by statute, and because it did not meet other statu-\ntory criteria. Ibid. The Court felt it necessary to observe,\nhowever, that \u201c[w]hether the State could take out a copy-\nright for itself, or could enjoy the benefit of one taken out\nby an individual for it, as the assignee of a citizen of the\nUnited States or a resident therein, who should be the au-\nthor of a book, is a question not involved in the present case,\nand we refrain from considering it.\u201d Ibid.\n   Finally, in Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617 (1888), the\n\f4         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt addressed the limits of the government edicts doc-\ntrine. In that case, the Court settled another dispute be-\ntween a publisher of court decisions and an alleged in-\nfringer. The plaintiff purchased the proprietary rights to\nthe reports prepared by the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s re-\nporter of decisions, Freeman, including the copyright to the\nreports. Unlike in Banks, these reports also contained ma-\nterial authored by Freeman. Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 645.\nThe alleged infringers copied the judicial decisions and\nFreeman\u2019s materials. In finding for the plaintiff, this Court\nreiterated that \u201cthere can be no copyright in the opinions of\nthe judges, or in the work done by them in their official ca-\npacity as judges.\u201d Id., at 647 (citing Banks, 128 U. S. 244).\nBut the Court concluded that \u201cno [similar] ground of public\npolicy\u201d justified denying a state official a copyright\n\u201ccover[ing] the matter which is the result of his intellectual\nlabor.\u201d Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 647.\n                             II\n   These precedents establish that judicial opinions cannot\nbe copyrighted. But they do not exclude from copyright pro-\ntection notes that are prepared by an official court reporter\nand published together with the reported opinions. There\nis no apparent reason why the same logic would not apply\nto statutes and regulations. Thus, it must follow from our\nprecedents that statutes and regulations cannot be copy-\nrighted, but accompanying notes lacking legal force can be.\nSee Howell v. Miller, 91 F. 129 (CA6 1898) (Harlan, J.) (ex-\nplaining that, under Banks and Callaghan, annotations to\nMichigan statutes could be copyrighted).\n                               A\n  It is fair to say that the Court\u2019s 19th-century decisions do\nnot provide any extended explanation of the basis for the\ngovernment edicts doctrine. The majority is nonetheless\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

But the contours of the rule were\nfar from clear, and to understand the scope of the doctrine,\nwe must explore its underlying rationale.\n   In my view, the majority\u2019s uncritical extrapolation of\nprecedent is inconsistent with the judicial role. An unwill-\ningness to examine the root of a precedent has led to the\nsprouting of many noxious weeds that distort the meaning\nof the Constitution and statutes alike. Although we have\nnot been asked to revisit these precedents, it behooves us to\nexplore the origin of and justification for them, especially\nwhen we are asked to apply their rule for the first time in\nover 130 years.\n   The Court\u2019s precedents suggest three possible grounds\nsupporting their conclusion. In Banks, the Court referred\nto the meaning of the term \u201cauthor\u201d in copyright law. While\nthe Court did not develop this argument, it is conceivable\nthat the contemporaneous public meaning of the term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d was narrower in the copyright context than in ordi-\nnary speech. At the time this Court decided Banks, the\nCopyright Act provided protection for books, maps, prints,\nengravings, musical and dramatic compositions, photo-\ngraphs, and works of art.1 Judicial opinions differ markedly\nfrom these works. Books, for instance, express the thoughts\nof their authors. They typically have no power beyond the\nability of their words to influence readers, and they usually\nare published at private expense. Judicial opinions, on the\nother hand, do not simply express the thoughts of the\njudges who write or endorse them. Instead, they elaborate\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See 1 Stat. 124; 2 Stat. 171; ch. 16, 4 Stat. 436; 11 Stat. 138\u2013139; 13\n\nStat. 540; 16 Stat. 212.\n\f6          GEORGIA v.

Unlike other copyright-\nable works of authorship, judicial opinions have binding le-\ngal effect, and they are produced and issued at public\nexpense. Moreover, copyright law understands an author\nto be one whose work will be encouraged by the grant of an\nexclusive right. See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,\n579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6). But judges, when\nacting in an official capacity, do not fit that description. The\nCourt in Banks may have had these differences in mind\nwhen it concluded that a judge fell outside the scope of the\nterm \u201cauthor.\u201d 128 U. S., at 253.\n   History may also suggest a narrower meaning of \u201cauthor\u201d\nin the copyright context. In England, at least as far back as\n1666, courts and commentators agreed \u201cthat the property\nof all law books is in the king, because he pays the judges\nwho pronounce the law.\u201d G. Curtis, Law of Copyright 130\n(1847); see also Banks & Bros. v. West Publishing Co., 27 F.\n50, 57 (CC Minn. 1886) (citing English cases and treatises\nand concluding that \u201cEnglish courts generally sustain the\ncrown\u2019s proprietary rights in judicial opinions\u201d). Black-\nstone described this as a \u201cprerogative copyrigh[t],\u201d explain-\ning that \u201c[t]he king, as the executive magistrate, has the\nright of promulging to the people all acts of state and gov-\nernment. This gives him the exclusive privilege of printing,\nat his own press, or that of his grantees, all acts of parlia-\nment, proclamations, and orders of council.\u201d 2 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 410 (1766)\n(emphasis deleted); see also Wheaton, 8 Pet., at 659\u2013660.\nThis history helps to explain the dearth of cases permitting\nindividuals to obtain copyrights in judicial opinions. But\nunder the Constitution, sovereignty lies with the people,\nnot a king. See The Federalist No. 22, p. 152 (C. Rossiter\ned. 1961); id., No. 39, at 241. The English historical prac-\ntice, when superimposed on the Constitution\u2019s recognition\nthat sovereignty resides in the people, helps to explain the\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

S., at 253.\n   Finally, concerns of fair notice, often recognized by this\nCourt\u2019s precedents as an important component of due\nprocess, also may have animated the reasoning of these\n19th-century cases. As one court put it, \u201c[t]he decisions and\nopinions of the justices are the authorized expositions and\ninterpretations of the laws, which are binding upon all the\ncitizens. . . . Every citizen is presumed to know the law thus\ndeclared, and it needs no argument to show that justice re-\nquires that all should have free access to the opinions.\u201d\nNash v. Lathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 35, 6 N. E. 559, 560 (1886)\n(cited in Banks, 128 U. S., at 253\u2013254); see also American\nSoc. for Testing and Materials v.

First, unlike judicial opinions and statutes,\nthese annotations do not even purport to embody the will of\nthe people because they are not law. The General Assembly\nof Georgia has made abundantly clear through a variety of\nprovisions that the annotations do not create any binding\nobligations. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20137 states that \u201c[a]ll historical cita-\ntions, title and chapter analyses, and notes set out in this\nCode are given for the purpose of convenient reference and\ndo not constitute part of the law.\u201d Section 1\u20131\u20131 further\nprovides that \u201c[t]he statutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws . . . is enacted and shall have the effect of stat-\nutes enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia. The stat-\nutory portion of such codification shall be merged with an-\nnotations . . . and other materials . . . and shall be published\nby authority of the state.\u201d Thus, although the materials\n\f8         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cmerge\u201d prior to publication in the \u201cofficial\u201d code, the very\nprovision calling for that merger makes clear that the an-\nnotations serve as commentary, not law.\n   As additional evidence that the annotations do not repre-\nsent the will of the people, the General Assembly does not\nenact statutory annotations under its legislative power.\nSee Ga. Const., Art. III, \u00a71, \u00b61 (vesting the legislative power\nin the General Assembly). To enact state law, Georgia em-\nploys a process of bicameralism and presentment similar to\nthat embodied in the United States Constitution. See Ga.\nConst., Art. III, \u00a75; Art. V, \u00a72, \u00b64. The annotations do not\ngo through this process, a fact that even the majority must\nacknowledge. Ante, at 10; Ga. S. 52, Reg. Sess., \u00a754(b)\n(2019\u20132020) (\u201cAnnotations . . . except as otherwise provided\nin the Code . . . are not enacted as statutes by the provisions\nof this Act\u201d).\n   Second, unlike judges and legislators, the creators of an-\nnotations are incentivized by the copyright laws to produce\na desirable product that will eventually earn them a profit.\nAnd though the Commission may require Lexis to follow\nstrict guidelines, the independent synthesis, analysis, and\ncreative drafting behind the annotations makes them anal-\nogous to other copyrightable materials. See Brief for Mat-\nthew Bender & Co., Inc., as Amicus Curiae 4\u20137.\n   Lastly, the annotations do not impede fair notice of the\nlaws. As just stated, the annotations do not carry the bind-\ning force of law. They simply summarize independent\nsources of legal information and consolidate them in one\nplace. Thus, OCGA annotations serve a similar function to\nother copyrighted research tools provided by private parties\nsuch as the American Law Reports and Westlaw, which also\ncontain information of great \u201cpractical significance.\u201d Ante,\nat 17. Compare, e.g., OCGA \u00a734\u20139\u2013260 (annotation for Cho\nCarwash Property, L. L. C. v. Everett, 326 Ga. App. 6, 755\nS. E. 2d 823 (2014)) with Ga.

Ante, at 17.\nThat is simply incorrect. As the majority tacitly concedes,\na person seeking information about changes in Georgia\nstatutory law can find that information by consulting the\noriginal source for the change in the law\u2019s status\u2014the court\ndecisions themselves. See ante, at 17. The inability to ac-\ncess the OCGA merely deprives a researcher of one specific\ntool, not to the underlying factual or legal information sum-\nmarized in that tool. See also post, at 4 (GINSBURG, J., dis-\nsenting).2\n                            C\n  The text of the Copyright Act supports my reading of the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The majority contends that, rather than seeking to understand the\n\norigins of our precedents, we should simply accept the text of the opinions\nthat the Justices \u201cvoted on and committed to writing.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317,\nn. 4. But that begs the question: What does the text of the relevant opin-\nions tell us? The answer is not much. It is precisely this lack of explica-\ntion that makes it necessary to explore the \u201cjudicial consensus\u201d and pub-\nlic policy referred to in Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244, 253 (1888).\nInstead, the majority attempts to dissect the language of our prior opin-\nions in the same way it would interpret a statute, an approach we have\nrepeatedly cautioned against. See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509\nU. S. 502, 515 (1993); Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 341 (1979).\nThe proper approach is to \u201cread general language in judicial opinions . . .\nas referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances\nthen before the Court and not referring to quite different circumstances\nthat the Court was not then considering.\u201d Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U. S.\n419, 424 (2004); see also Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399 (1821)\n(Marshall, C. J., for the Court) (\u201c[G]eneral expressions, in every opinion,\nare to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions\nare used.

PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprecedents.3 Specifically, there are four indications in the\ntext of the Copyright Act that the OCGA annotations are\ncopyrightable. As an initial matter, the Act does not define\nthe word \u201cauthor,\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7101, or make any reference\nto the government edicts doctrine. Accordingly, the term\n\u201cauthor\u201d itself does not shed any light on whether the doc-\ntrine covers statutory annotations. Second, while the Act\nexcludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s] prepared by an\nofficer or employee of the United States Government as part\nof that person\u2019s official duties,\u201d \u00a7101; see also \u00a7105, the Act\ncontains no similar prohibition against works of state gov-\nernments or works prepared at their behest. \u201cCongress\u2019 use\nof explicit language in one provision cautions against infer-\nring the same limitation\u201d elsewhere in the statute. State\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n580 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Val-\nladolid, 565 U. S. 207, 216 (2012). Third, the Act specifi-\ncally notes that annotations are copyrightable derivative\nworks. \u00a7101. Here, again, the Act does not expressly ex-\nclude from copyright protection annotations created either\nby the State or at the State\u2019s request. Fourth, the Act pro-\nvides that an author may hold a copyright in \u201cmaterial con-\ntributed\u201d in a derivative work, \u201cas distinguished from the\npreexisting material employed in the work.\u201d \u00a7103(b); see\nalso Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.,\n499 U. S. 340, 359 (1991). These aspects of the statutory\ntext, taken together, further support the conclusion that the\nOCGA annotations are copyrightable.\n   For all these reasons, I would conclude that, as with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the majority explains, ante, at 9, the annotations were created as\n\npart of a work-for-hire agreement between the Commission and Lexis.\nSee 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b). Because no party disputes the validity of the\ncontract, I express no opinion regarding whether the contract established\nan employer/employee relationship or whether the Commission may be\nconsidered a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7201(b).\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

In\nits view, the Court in Banks held that judges are not \u201cau-\nthors\u201d within the scope of the Copyright Act for \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d 128 U. S., at\n253, so the same must be true for legislators, see ante, at 8\u2013\n9. Accordingly, works created by legislators in their legis-\nlative capacity are not \u201coriginal works of authorship,\u201d \u00a7102,\nand therefore cannot be copyrighted. This argument is\nflawed in multiple respects.\n                               A\n   Most notably, the majority\u2019s textual analysis hinges on\naccepting that its construction of \u201cauthorship,\u201d i.e., all\nworks produced in a judge\u2019s or legislator\u2019s official capacity,\nwas so well established by our 19th-century precedents that\nCongress incorporated it into the multiple revisions of the\nCopyright Act. See ante, at 12\u201313. Such confidence is ques-\ntionable, to say the least.\n   The majority\u2019s understanding of the government edicts\ndoctrine seems to have been lost on dozens of States and\nTerritories, as well as the lower courts in this case. As al-\nready stated, the 25 jurisdictions with official annotated\ncodes apparently did not view this Court\u2019s precedents as es-\ntablishing the \u201cofficial duties\u201d definition of authorship. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae.4 And if\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 According to one study published in 2000, approximately half of\n\nStates owned copyright in official state statutory compilations, court re-\nports, or administrative regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of\nCopyrights in Primary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertain-\nment L. J. 81, 83, 97\u2013105 (2000). The majority attempts to undermine\nthis study by emphasizing that some of these States owned copyright in\nprimary law materials. Ante, at 13, n. 3. This misunderstands the point.\n\f12          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cour precedents answer the question\u201d so clearly, ante, at 14,\none wonders why the Eleventh Circuit reached its conclu-\nsion in such a roundabout fashion. Rather than following\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cstraightforward\u201d path, ante, at 5, the Elev-\nenth Circuit looked to the \u201czone of indeterminacy at the\nfrontier between edicts that carry the force of law and\nthose that do not\u201d to determine whether the annotations\nwere \u201csufficiently law-like\u201d to be \u201cconstructively authored\nby the People.\u201d Code Revision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Re-\nsource.Org, Inc., 906 F. 3d 1229, 1233, 1242, 1243 (2018).\nThe District Court likewise does not appear to have viewed\nthe question as well settled. In a cursory analysis, it deter-\nmined that the annotations were copyrightable based on\nCallaghan. Code Revision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org,\nInc., 244 F. Supp. 3d 1350, 1356 (ND Ga. 2017). It is risible\nto presume that Congress had knowledge of and incorpo-\nrated a \u201csettled\u201d meaning that eluded a multitude of States\nand Territories, as well as at least four Article III judges.\nAnte, at 13. Cf. Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n  This presumption of congressional knowledge also pro-\nvides the basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the anno-\ntations are not \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d See ante, at\n11\u201312 (discussing \u00a7101). Stripped of the fiction that this\nCourt\u2019s 19th-century precedents clearly demonstrated that\n\u201cauthorship\u201d encompassed all works performed as part of a\nlegislator\u2019s duties, the majority\u2019s textual argument fails.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI do not claim that this evidence demonstrates that the States neces-\nsarily interpreted the government edicts doctrine correctly. I merely\npoint out that these divergent practices seriously undercut the majority\u2019s\nclaim that its interpretation of \u201cauthorship\u201d was well settled and univer-\nsally understood. On this score, the majority has no answer but to insin-\nuate that the lawmakers of over half the Nation\u2019s jurisdictions disre-\ngarded federal law and the Constitution to pursue their own agendas in\nthe face of supposedly clear precedent.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

In-\nstead, it simply repeats, without any further elaboration,\nits unsupported conclusion that \u201c[t]he Court long ago inter-\npreted the word \u2018author\u2019 to exclude officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law, and Congress has carried that\nmeaning forward in multiple iterations of the Copyright\nAct.\u201d Ante, at 16. This wave of the \u201cmagic wand of ipse\ndixit\u201d does nothing to strengthen the majority\u2019s argument,\nand in fact only serves to underscore its weakness. United\nStates v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 77 (1984) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting).5\n                                B\n  In addition to its textual deficiencies, the majority\u2019s un-\nderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedents fails to account for\nthe critical differences between the role that judicial opin-\nions play in expounding upon the law compared to that of\nstatutes. The majority finds it meaningful, for instance,\nthat Banks prohibited dissents and concurrences from be-\ning copyrighted, even though they carry no legal force.\nAnte, at 15. At an elementary level, it is true that the judg-\nment is the only part of a judicial decision that has legal\neffect. But it blinks reality to ignore that every word of a\njudicial opinion\u2014whether it is a majority, a concurrence, or\na dissent\u2014expounds upon the law in ways that do not map\nneatly on to the legislative function. Setting aside sum-\nmary decisions, the reader of a judicial opinion will always\ngain critical insight into the reasoning underlying a judicial\nholding by reading all opinions in their entirety. Under-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority\u2019s approach is also hard to reconcile with the recognition\n\nin Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), that annotations prepared by the\nReporter of Decisions could be copyrighted. Wheaton was paid a salary\nof $1,000, and it is difficult to say whether this salary funded his work\non the opinions or his work on the annotations. See id., at 614, 617 (ar-\ngument).\n\f14           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nstanding the reasoning that animates the rule in turn pro-\nvides pivotal insight into how the law will likely be applied\nin future judicial opinions.6 Thus, deprived of access to ju-\ndicial opinions, individuals cannot access the primary, and\ntherefore best, source of information for the meaning of the\nlaw.7 And as true as that is today, access to these opinions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 For instance, this Court has not overruled Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403\n\nU. S. 602 (1971), which pronounced a test for evaluating Establishment\nClause claims. But a reader would do well to carefully scrutinize the\nvarious opinions in American Legion v. American Humanist Assn., 588\nU. S. ___ (2019), to understand the markedly different way that this prec-\nedent functions in our current jurisprudence compared to when it was\nfirst decided. Moreover, sometimes a separate writing takes on canonical\nstatus, like Justice Jackson\u2019s concurrence regarding the executive power\nin Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 634\u2013638\n(1952) (opinion concurring in judgment and opinion of the Court); see\nalso Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 360\u2013361 (1967) (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring) (reasonable expectation of privacy Fourth Amendment test).\nStill other times, the reasoning in an opinion for less than a majority of\nthe Court provides the explicit basis for a later majority\u2019s holding. See,\ne.g., McKinney v. Arizona, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 5) (dis-\ncussing Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 612 (2002) (Scalia J., concur-\nring)); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.

See also post, at 2 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n   These differences provide crucial context for Banks\u2019 rea-\nsoning.

See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a72\u20134\u2013203(1)(c) (2019); Iowa Code \u00a74.6(3)\n(2019); Minn. Stat. \u00a7645.16(7) (2018); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a712\u20132A\u201320(C)(2)\n(2019); N. D.

But the majority\u2019s test for ascertaining the true\nnature of these commissions raises far more questions than\nit answers.\n   The majority lists a number of factors\u2014including the\nCommission\u2019s membership and funding, how the annota-\ntions become part of the OCGA, and descriptions of the\nCommission from court cases\u2014to support its conclusion\nthat the Commission is really part of the legislature. See\nante, at 9\u201310. But it does not specify whether these factors\nare exhaustive or illustrative and, if the latter, what other\nfactors may be important. The majority also does not spec-\nify whether some factors weigh more heavily than others\nwhen deciding whether to deem an oversight body a legis-\nlative adjunct.\n   And even when the majority does list concrete factors,\npivotal guidance remains lacking. For example, the major-\nity finds it meaningful that 9 out of the Commission\u2019s 15\nmembers are legislators.

Nor are\nother materials created by state legislators in the course of\nperforming their lawmaking responsibilities, e.g., legisla-\ntive committee reports, floor statements, unenacted bills.\nAnte, at 8\u20139. Not all that legislators do, however, is ineligi-\nble for copyright protection; the government edicts doctrine\nshields only \u201cworks that are (1) created by judges and leg-\nislators (2) in the course of their judicial and legislative du-\nties.\u201d Ante, at 9 (emphasis added). The core question this\ncase presents, as I see it: Are the annotations in the Official\nCode of Georgia Annotated (OCGA) done in a legislative ca-\npacity? The answer, I am persuaded, should be no.\n   To explain why, I proceed from common ground. All\nagree that headnotes and syllabi for judicial opinions\u2014both\na kind of annotation\u2014are copyrightable when created by a\nreporter of decisions, Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617,\n645\u2013650 (1888), but are not copyrightable when created by\njudges, Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244, 253 (1888).\nThat is so because \u201c[t]he whole work done by . . . judges,\u201d\nibid., including dissenting and concurring opinions, ranks\nas work performed in their judicial capacity. Judges do not\noutsource their writings to \u201carm[s]\u201d or \u201cadjunct[s],\u201d cf. ante,\nat 9, 11, to be composed in their stead. Accordingly, the\n\f2           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\njudicial opinion-drafting process in its entirety\u2014including\nthe drafting of headnotes and syllabi, in jurisdictions where\nthat is done by judges\u2014falls outside the reach of copyright\nprotection.\n  One might ask: If a judge\u2019s annotations are not copyright-\nable, why are those created by legislators? The answer lies\nin the difference between the role of a judge and the role of\na legislator. \u201c[T]o the judiciary\u201d we assign \u201cthe duty of in-\nterpreting and applying\u201d the law, Massachusetts v. Mellon,\n262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923), and sometimes making the appli-\ncable law, see Friendly, In Praise of Erie\u2014and of the New\nFederal Common Law, 39 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 383 (1964). See\nalso Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (\u201cIt is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-\nment to say what the law is.\u201d). In contrast, the role of the\nlegislature encompasses the process of \u201cmaking laws\u201d\u2014not\nconstruing statutes after their enactment. Mellon, 262\nU. S., at 488; see Patchak v. Zinke, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5) (\u201c[T]he legislative power is\nthe power to make law.\u201d). The OCGA annotations, in my\nappraisal, do not rank as part of the Georgia Legislature\u2019s\nlawmaking process for three reasons.\n  First, the annotations are not created contemporaneously\nwith the statutes to which they pertain; instead, the anno-\ntations comment on statutes already enacted. See, e.g.,\nApp. 268\u2013269 (text of enacted laws are transmitted to the\npublisher for the addition of commentary); id., at 403\u2013404\n(publisher adds new case notes on a rolling basis as courts\nconstrue existing statutes).1 In short, annotating begins\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For example, OCGA \u00a711\u20132A\u2013213 was enacted, in its current form, in\n\n1993. See 1993 Ga. Laws p. 633. The case notes contained in the OCGA\nsummarize judicial decisions construing the statute years later. See\n\u00a711\u20132A\u2013213 (2002) (citing Griffith v. Medical Rental Supply of Albany,\nGa., Inc., 244 Ga. App. 120, 534 S. E. 2d 859 (2000); Bailey v. Tucker\nEquip. Sales, Inc., 236 Ga. App. 289, 510 S. E. 2d 904 (1999)).\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nonly after lawmaking ends. This sets the OCGA annota-\ntions apart from uncopyrightable legislative materials like\ncommittee reports, generated before a law\u2019s enactment, and\ntied tightly to the task of law-formulation.\n   Second, the OCGA annotations are descriptive rather\nthan prescriptive. Instead of stating the legislature\u2019s per-\nception of what a law conveys, the annotations summarize\nwritings in which others express their views on a given stat-\nute. For example, the OCGA contains \u201ccase annotations\u201d\nfor \u201c[a]ll decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the\nCourt of Appeals of Georgia and all decisions of the federal\ncourts in cases which arose in Georgia construing any por-\ntion of the general statutory law of the state.\u201d Id., at 403.\nPer the Code Revision Commission\u2019s instructions, each an-\nnotation should \u201caccurately reflect the facts, holding, and\nstatutory construction\u201d adopted by the court. Id., at 404.\nThe annotations are neutrally cast; they do not opine on\nwhether the summarized case was correctly decided. See,\ne.g., OCGA \u00a717\u20137\u201350 (2013) (case annotation summarizing\nfacts and holdings of nine cases construing right to grand\njury hearing). This characteristic of the annotations distin-\nguishes them from preenactment legislative materials that\ntouch or concern the correct interpretation of the legisla-\nture\u2019s work.\n   Third, and of prime importance, the OCGA annotations\nare \u201cgiven for the purpose of convenient reference\u201d by the\npublic, \u00a71\u20131\u20137 (2019); they aim to inform the citizenry at\nlarge, they do not address, particularly, those seated in leg-\nislative chambers.2 Annotations are thus unlike, for exam-\nple, surveys, work commissioned by a legislature to aid in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Suppose a committee of Georgia\u2019s legislature, to inform the public,\n\ninstructs a staffer to write a guide titled \u201cThe Workways of the Georgia\nLegislature.\u201d The final text describing how the legislature operates is\ncirculated to members of the legislature and approved by a majority.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s decision, I take it that such a work, which entails\nno lawmaking, would be copyrightable.\n\f4            GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndetermining whether existing law should be amended.\n   The requirement that the statutory portions of the OCGA\n\u201cshall be merged with annotations,\u201d \u00a71\u20131\u20131, does not ren-\nder the annotations anything other than explanatory, ref-\nerential, or commentarial material. See Harrison Co. v.\nCode Revision Comm\u2019n, 244 Ga. 325, 331, 260 S. E. 2d 30,\n35 (1979) (observation by the Supreme Court of Georgia\nthat \u201cinclusion of annotations in [the] \u2018official Code\u2019 \u201d does\nnot \u201cgive the annotations any official weight\u201d).3 Annota-\ntions aid the legal researcher, and that aid is enhanced\nwhen annotations are printed beneath or alongside the rel-\nevant statutory text. But the placement of annotations in\nthe OCGA does not alter their auxiliary, nonlegislative\ncharacter.\n\n                       *     *     *\n   Because summarizing judicial decisions and commentary\nbearing on enacted statutes, in contrast to, for example,\ndrafting a committee report to accompany proposed legisla-\ntion, is not done in a legislator\u2019s law-shaping capacity, I\nwould hold the OCGA annotations copyrightable and there-\nfore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 That the Georgia Supreme Court described the Commission\u2019s work as\n\n\u201cwithin the sphere of legislative authority\u201d for state separation-of-powers\npurposes, Harrison Co. v.

Under the government edicts doctrine,\n  officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot be the au-\n  thors of the works they create in the course of their official duties.\n     The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the Official Code of Geor-\n  gia Annotated (OCGA). That Code includes the text of every Georgia\n  statute currently in force, as well as a set of non-binding annotations\n  that appear beneath each statutory provision. The annotations typi-\n  cally include summaries of judicial opinions construing each provision,\n  summaries of pertinent opinions of the state attorney general, and a\n  list of related law review articles and other reference materials. The\n  OCGA is assembled by the Code Revision Commission, a state entity\n  composed mostly of legislators, funded through legislative branch ap-\n  propriations, and staffed by the Office of Legislative Counsel.\n     The annotations in the current OCGA were produced by Matthew\n  Bender & Co., Inc., a division of the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a\n  work-for-hire agreement with the Commission. Under the agreement,\n  Lexis drafts the annotations under the supervision of the Commission,\n  which specifies what the annotations must include in exacting detail.\n  The agreement also states that any copyright in the OCGA vests in the\n  State of Georgia, acting through the Commission.\n     Respondent Public.Resource.Org (PRO), a nonprofit dedicated to fa-\n  cilitating public access to government records and legal materials,\n  posted the OCGA online and distributed copies to various organiza-\n  tions and Georgia officials. After sending PRO several cease-and-de-\n  sist letters, the Commission sued PRO for infringing its copyright in\n  the OCGA annotations. PRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory\n  judgment that the entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\n\f2             GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    public domain. The District Court sided with the Commission, holding\n    that the annotations were eligible for copyright protection because\n    they had not been enacted into law. The Eleventh Circuit reversed,\n    rejecting the Commission\u2019s copyright assertion under the government\n    edicts doctrine.\nHeld: The OCGA annotations are ineligible for copyright protection.\n Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The government edicts doctrine developed from a trio of 19th-\n century cases. In Wheaton v. Peters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85911\"><a href=\"/opinion/85911/wheaton-and-donaldson-v-peters-and-grigg/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court held that no\n reporter can have a copyright in the Court\u2019s opinions and that the Jus-\n tices cannot confer such a right on any reporter. In Banks v. Manches-\n ter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92329\"><a href=\"/opinion/92329/banks-v-manchester/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court held that judges could not assert copyright\n in \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity as judges\u201d\u2014be it \u201cthe\n opinion or decision, the statement of the case and the syllabus or the\n head note.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92329\"> <a href=\"/opinion/92329/banks-v-manchester/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 253. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Finally, in Callaghan v. Myers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92372\"><a href=\"/opinion/92372/callaghan-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n the Court reiterated that an official reporter cannot hold a copyright\n interest in opinions created by judges. But, confronting an issue not\n addressed in Wheaton or Banks, the Court upheld the reporter\u2019s copy-\n right interest in several explanatory materials that the reporter had\n created himself because they came from an author who had no author-\n ity to speak with the force of law.\n    The animating principle behind the government edicts doctrine is\n that no one can own the law. The doctrine gives effect to that principle\n in the copyright context through construction of the statutory term\n \u201cauthor.\u201d For purposes of the Copyright Act, judges cannot be the \u201cau-\n thor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity\u201d as lawmak-\n ers. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92329\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Banks,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/92329/banks-v-manchester/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Because legislators, like judges, have\n the authority to make law, it follows that they, too, cannot be \u201cau-\n thors.\u201d And, as with judges, the doctrine applies to whatever work\n legislators perform in their capacity as legislators, including explana-\n tory and procedural materials they create in the discharge of their leg-\n islative duties. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not copy-\n rightable. First, the author of the annotations qualifies as a legislator.\n Under the Copyright Act, the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the annotations is the\n Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7201(b), which functions as an arm of the\n Georgia Legislature in producing the annotations. Second, the Com-\n mission creates the annotations in the discharge of its legislative du-\n ties. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (c) Georgia argues that excluding the OCGA annotations from copy-\n right protection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. First, it\n notes that \u00a7101 lists \u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible\n for copyright protection. That provision, however, refers only to \u201can-\n notations . . . which . . . represent an original work of authorship.\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (Emphasis added.) Georgia\u2019s annotations do not fit that description\n  because they are prepared by a legislative body that cannot be deemed\n  the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works it creates in its official capacity. Second,\n  Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact that the Act excludes\n  from copyright protection works prepared by Federal Government of-\n  ficials, without establishing a similar rule for State officials. \u00a7\u00a7101,\n  105. That rule, however, applies to all federal officials, regardless of\n  the nature and scope of their duties. It does not suggest an intent to\n  displace the much narrower government edicts doctrine with respect\n  to the States.\n     Moving on from the text, Georgia invokes what it views as the offi-\n  cial position of the Copyright Office, as reflected in the Compendium\n  of U. S. Copyright Office Practices. The Compendium, however, is a\n  non-binding administrative manual and is largely consistent with this\n  Court\u2019s position. Georgia also appeals to copyright policy, but such\n  requests should be addressed to Congress, not the courts.\n     Georgia attempts to frame the government edicts doctrine to focus\n  exclusively on whether a particular work has the force of law. But that\n  understanding cannot be squared with precedent\u2014especially Banks.\n  Moreover, Georgia\u2019s conception of the doctrine as distinguishing be-\n  tween different categories of content with different effects has less of\n  a textual footing than the traditional formulation, which focuses on the\n  identity of the author. Georgia\u2019s characterization of the OCGA anno-\n  tations as non-binding and non-authoritative undersells the practical\n  significance of the annotations to litigants and citizens. And its ap-\n  proach would logically permit States to hide all non-binding judicial\n  and legislative work product\u2014including dissents and legislative his-\n  tory\u2014behind a paywall.

The question in this case is whether that protec-\ntion extends to the annotations contained in Georgia\u2019s\nofficial annotated code.\n   We hold that it does not. Over a century ago, we recog-\nnized a limitation on copyright protection for certain\ngovernment work product, rooted in the Copyright Act\u2019s\n\u201cauthorship\u201d requirement. Under what has been dubbed\nthe government edicts doctrine, officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law cannot be the authors of\u2014and\ntherefore cannot copyright\u2014the works they create in the\ncourse of their official duties.\n   We have previously applied that doctrine to hold that\nnon-binding, explanatory legal materials are not copyright-\nable when created by judges who possess the authority to\nmake and interpret the law. See Banks v. Manchester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92329\"><a href=\"/opinion/92329/banks-v-manchester/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1888). We now recognize that the same logic ap-\nplies to non-binding, explanatory legal materials created by\n\f2         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na legislative body vested with the authority to make law.\nBecause Georgia\u2019s annotations are authored by an arm\nof the legislature in the course of its legislative duties, the\ngovernment edicts doctrine puts them outside the reach of\ncopyright protection.\n                              I\n                              A\n   The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the \u201cOfficial\nCode of Georgia Annotated,\u201d or OCGA. The first page of\neach volume of the OCGA boasts the State\u2019s official seal and\nannounces to readers that it is \u201cPublished Under Authority\nof the State.\u201d\n   The OCGA includes the text of every Georgia statute\ncurrently in force, as well as various non-binding supple-\nmentary materials. At issue in this case is a set of annota-\ntions that appear beneath each statutory provision. The\nannotations generally include summaries of judicial deci-\nsions applying a given provision, summaries of any perti-\nnent opinions of the state attorney general, and a list of re-\nlated law review articles and similar reference materials.\nIn addition, the annotations often include editor\u2019s notes\nthat provide information about the origins of the statutory\ntext, such as whether it derives from a particular judicial\ndecision or resembles an older provision that has been con-\nstrued by Georgia courts. See, e.g., OCGA \u00a7\u00a751\u20131\u20131, 53\u20134\u2013\n2 (2019).\n   The OCGA is assembled by a state entity called the Code\nRevision Commission. In 1977, the Georgia Legislature\nestablished the Commission to recodify Georgia law for the\nfirst time in decades. The Commission was (and remains)\ntasked with consolidating disparate bills into a single Code\nfor reenactment by the legislature and contracting with a\nthird party to produce the annotations. A majority of the\nCommission\u2019s 15 members must be members of the Georgia\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Without permission, PRO posted a dig-\nital version of the OCGA on various websites, where it could\nbe downloaded by the public without charge. PRO also\ndistributed copies of the OCGA to various organizations\nand Georgia officials.\n   In response, the Commission sent PRO several cease-\nand-desist letters asserting that PRO\u2019s actions constituted\nunlawful copyright infringement. When PRO refused to\nhalt its distribution activities, the Commission sued PRO\non behalf of the Georgia Legislature and the State of Geor-\ngia for copyright infringement. The Commission limited its\nassertion of copyright to the annotations described above; it\ndid not claim copyright in the statutory text or numbering.\nPRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\npublic domain.\n   The District Court sided with the Commission.

The Court understood those cases to establish a\n\u201crule\u201d based on an interpretation of the statutory term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d that \u201cworks created by courts in the performance of\ntheir official duties did not belong to the judges\u201d but instead\nfell \u201cin the public </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">domain.\u201d</span> <span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>, at <span class=\"page\">1239</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

A\ncareful examination of our government edicts precedents\nreveals a straightforward rule based on the identity of the\nauthor. Under the government edicts doctrine, judges\u2014\nand, we now confirm, legislators\u2014may not be considered\n\f6         GEORGIA v.

At the\noutset, Georgia advances two arguments for why, in its\nview, excluding the OCGA annotations from copyright\nprotection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. Both\nare unavailing.\n   First, Georgia notes that \u00a7101 of the Act specifically lists\n\u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible for copy-\nright protection. But that provision refers only to \u201cannota-\ntions . . . which . . . represent an original work of author-\nship.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7101 (emphasis added). The whole point\nof the government edicts doctrine is that judges and legis-\nlators cannot serve as authors when they produce works in\ntheir official capacity. While the reference to \u201cannotations\u201d\n\f12        GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin \u00a7101 may help explain why supplemental, explanatory\nmaterials are copyrightable when prepared by a private\nparty, or a non-lawmaking official like the reporter in Cal-\nlaghan, it does not speak to whether those same materials\nare copyrightable when prepared by a judge or a legislator.\nIn the same way that judicial materials are ineligible for\nprotection even though they plainly qualify as \u201c[l]iterary\nworks . . . expressed in words,\u201d ibid., legislative materials\nare ineligible for protection even if they happen to fit the\ndescription of otherwise copyrightable \u201cannotations.\u201d\n  Second, Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact\nthat the Act excludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s]\nprepared by an officer or employee of the United States\nGovernment as part of that person\u2019s official duties\u201d and\ndoes not establish a similar rule for the States. \u00a7101; see\nalso \u00a7105. But the bar on copyright protection for federal\nworks sweeps much more broadly than the government\nedicts doctrine does. That bar applies to works created by\nall federal \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s],\u201d without regard for the\nnature of their position or scope of their authority. What-\never policy reasons might justify the Federal Government\u2019s\ndecision to forfeit copyright protection for its own proprie-\ntary works, that federal rule does not suggest an intent to\ndisplace the much narrower government edicts doctrine\nwith respect to the States. That doctrine does not apply to\nnon-lawmaking officials, leaving States free to assert copy-\nright in the vast majority of expressive works they produce,\nsuch as those created by their universities, libraries,\ntourism offices, and so on.\n  More generally, Georgia suggests that we should resist\napplying our government edicts precedents to the OCGA\nannotations because our 19th-century forebears inter-\npreted the statutory term author by reference to \u201cpublic\npolicy\u201d\u2014an approach that Georgia believes is incongruous\nwith the \u201cmodern era\u201d of statutory interpretation.

Surely these supplementary materials do\nnot have the force of law, yet they are covered by the doc-\ntrine.

Under\nthe logic of Georgia\u2019s \u201cforce of law\u201d test, States would own\nsuch materials and could charge the public for access to\nthem.\n  Furthermore, despite Georgia\u2019s and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\npurported concern for the text of the Copyright Act, their\nconception of the government edicts doctrine has less of a\ntextual footing than the traditional formulation. The tex-\ntual basis for the doctrine is the Act\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d require-\nment, which unsurprisingly focuses on\u2014the author.\nJUSTICE THOMAS urges us to dig deeper to \u201cthe root\u201d of our\ngovernment edicts precedents. Post, at 5. But, in our view,\nthe text is the root. The Court long ago interpreted the\nword \u201cauthor\u201d to exclude officials empowered to speak with\nthe force of law, and Congress has carried that meaning for-\nward in multiple iterations of the Copyright Act. This tex-\ntual foundation explains why the doctrine distinguishes be-\ntween some authors (who are empowered to speak with the\nforce of law) and others (who are not).

But the contours of the rule were\nfar from clear, and to understand the scope of the doctrine,\nwe must explore its underlying rationale.\n   In my view, the majority\u2019s uncritical extrapolation of\nprecedent is inconsistent with the judicial role. An unwill-\ningness to examine the root of a precedent has led to the\nsprouting of many noxious weeds that distort the meaning\nof the Constitution and statutes alike. Although we have\nnot been asked to revisit these precedents, it behooves us to\nexplore the origin of and justification for them, especially\nwhen we are asked to apply their rule for the first time in\nover 130 years.\n   The Court\u2019s precedents suggest three possible grounds\nsupporting their conclusion. In Banks, the Court referred\nto the meaning of the term \u201cauthor\u201d in copyright law. While\nthe Court did not develop this argument, it is conceivable\nthat the contemporaneous public meaning of the term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d was narrower in the copyright context than in ordi-\nnary speech. At the time this Court decided Banks, the\nCopyright Act provided protection for books, maps, prints,\nengravings, musical and dramatic compositions, photo-\ngraphs, and works of art.1 Judicial opinions differ markedly\nfrom these works. Books, for instance, express the thoughts\nof their authors. They typically have no power beyond the\nability of their words to influence readers, and they usually\nare published at private expense. Judicial opinions, on the\nother hand, do not simply express the thoughts of the\njudges who write or endorse them. Instead, they elaborate\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See 1 Stat. 124; 2 Stat. 171; ch. 16, 4 Stat. 436; 11 Stat. 138\u2013139; 13\n\nStat. 540; 16 Stat. 212.\n\f6          GEORGIA v.

Unlike other copyright-\nable works of authorship, judicial opinions have binding le-\ngal effect, and they are produced and issued at public\nexpense. Moreover, copyright law understands an author\nto be one whose work will be encouraged by the grant of an\nexclusive right. See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,\n579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6). But judges, when\nacting in an official capacity, do not fit that description.

OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20137 states that \u201c[a]ll historical cita-\ntions, title and chapter analyses, and notes set out in this\nCode are given for the purpose of convenient reference and\ndo not constitute part of the law.\u201d Section 1\u20131\u20131 further\nprovides that \u201c[t]he statutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws . . . is enacted and shall have the effect of stat-\nutes enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia. The stat-\nutory portion of such codification shall be merged with an-\nnotations . . . and other materials . . . and shall be published\nby authority of the state.\u201d Thus, although the materials\n\f8         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cmerge\u201d prior to publication in the \u201cofficial\u201d code, the very\nprovision calling for that merger makes clear that the an-\nnotations serve as commentary, not law.\n   As additional evidence that the annotations do not repre-\nsent the will of the people, the General Assembly does not\nenact statutory annotations under its legislative power.\nSee Ga. Const., Art. III, \u00a71, \u00b61 (vesting the legislative power\nin the General Assembly). To enact state law, Georgia em-\nploys a process of bicameralism and presentment similar to\nthat embodied in the United States Constitution. See Ga.\nConst., Art. III, \u00a75; Art. V, \u00a72, \u00b64. The annotations do not\ngo through this process, a fact that even the majority must\nacknowledge. Ante, at 10; Ga. S. 52, Reg. Sess., \u00a754(b)\n(2019\u20132020) (\u201cAnnotations . . . except as otherwise provided\nin the Code . . . are not enacted as statutes by the provisions\nof this Act\u201d).\n   Second, unlike judges and legislators, the creators of an-\nnotations are incentivized by the copyright laws to produce\na desirable product that will eventually earn them a profit.\nAnd though the Commission may require Lexis to follow\nstrict guidelines, the independent synthesis, analysis, and\ncreative drafting behind the annotations makes them anal-\nogous to other copyrightable materials. See Brief for Mat-\nthew Bender & Co., Inc., as Amicus Curiae 4\u20137.\n   Lastly, the annotations do not impede fair notice of the\nlaws. As just stated, the annotations do not carry the bind-\ning force of law. They simply summarize independent\nsources of legal information and consolidate them in one\nplace. Thus, OCGA annotations serve a similar function to\nother copyrighted research tools provided by private parties\nsuch as the American Law Reports and Westlaw, which also\ncontain information of great \u201cpractical significance.\u201d Ante,\nat 17.

Ante, at 17.\nThat is simply incorrect.

See ante, at 17. The inability to ac-\ncess the OCGA merely deprives a researcher of one specific\ntool, not to the underlying factual or legal information sum-\nmarized in that tool.

PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprecedents.3 Specifically, there are four indications in the\ntext of the Copyright Act that the OCGA annotations are\ncopyrightable. As an initial matter, the Act does not define\nthe word \u201cauthor,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7101, or make any reference\nto the government edicts doctrine. Accordingly, the term\n\u201cauthor\u201d itself does not shed any light on whether the doc-\ntrine covers statutory annotations. Second, while the Act\nexcludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s] prepared by an\nofficer or employee of the United States Government as part\nof that person\u2019s official duties,\u201d \u00a7101; see also \u00a7105, the Act\ncontains no similar prohibition against works of state gov-\nernments or works prepared at their behest. \u201cCongress\u2019 use\nof explicit language in one provision cautions against infer-\nring the same limitation\u201d elsewhere in the statute. State\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n580 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v.

Third, the Act specifi-\ncally notes that annotations are copyrightable derivative\nworks. \u00a7101. Here, again, the Act does not expressly ex-\nclude from copyright protection annotations created either\nby the State or at the State\u2019s request. Fourth, the Act pro-\nvides that an author may hold a copyright in \u201cmaterial con-\ntributed\u201d in a derivative work, \u201cas distinguished from the\npreexisting material employed in the work.\u201d \u00a7103(b); see\nalso Feist Publications, Inc. v.

These aspects of the statutory\ntext, taken together, further support the conclusion that the\nOCGA annotations are copyrightable.\n   For all these reasons, I would conclude that, as with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the majority explains, ante, at 9, the annotations were created as\n\npart of a work-for-hire agreement between the Commission and Lexis.\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7201(b).

In\nits view, the Court in Banks held that judges are not \u201cau-\nthors\u201d within the scope of the Copyright Act for \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">judges,\u201d</span> <span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at\n<span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, so the same must be true for legislators, see ante, at 8\u2013\n9. Accordingly, works created by legislators in their legis-\nlative capacity are not \u201coriginal works of authorship,\u201d \u00a7102,\nand therefore cannot be copyrighted. This argument is\nflawed in multiple respects.\n                               A\n   Most notably, the majority\u2019s textual analysis hinges on\naccepting that its construction of \u201cauthorship,\u201d i.e., all\nworks produced in a judge\u2019s or legislator\u2019s official capacity,\nwas so well established by our 19th-century precedents that\nCongress incorporated it into the multiple revisions of the\nCopyright Act. See ante, at 12\u201313. Such confidence is ques-\ntionable, to say the least.\n   The majority\u2019s understanding of the government edicts\ndoctrine seems to have been lost on dozens of States and\nTerritories, as well as the lower courts in this case. As al-\nready stated, the 25 jurisdictions with official annotated\ncodes apparently did not view this Court\u2019s precedents as es-\ntablishing the \u201cofficial duties\u201d definition of authorship. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae.4 And if\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 According to one study published in 2000, approximately half of\n\nStates owned copyright in official state statutory compilations, court re-\nports, or administrative regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of\nCopyrights in Primary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertain-\nment L. J. 81, 83, 97\u2013105 (2000). The majority attempts to undermine\nthis study by emphasizing that some of these States owned copyright in\nprimary law materials. Ante, at 13, n. 3. This misunderstands the point.\n\f12          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cour precedents answer the question\u201d so clearly, ante, at 14,\none wonders why the Eleventh Circuit reached its conclu-\nsion in such a roundabout fashion. Rather than following\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cstraightforward\u201d path, ante, at 5, the Elev-\nenth Circuit looked to the \u201czone of indeterminacy at the\nfrontier between edicts that carry the force of law and\nthose that do not\u201d to determine whether the annotations\nwere \u201csufficiently law-like\u201d to be \u201cconstructively authored\nby the People.\u201d Code Revision Comm\u2019n v.

It is risible\nto presume that Congress had knowledge of and incorpo-\nrated a \u201csettled\u201d meaning that eluded a multitude of States\nand Territories, as well as at least four Article III judges.\nAnte, at 13. Cf. Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n  This presumption of congressional knowledge also pro-\nvides the basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the anno-\ntations are not \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d See ante, at\n11\u201312 (discussing \u00a7101). Stripped of the fiction that this\nCourt\u2019s 19th-century precedents clearly demonstrated that\n\u201cauthorship\u201d encompassed all works performed as part of a\nlegislator\u2019s duties, the majority\u2019s textual argument fails.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI do not claim that this evidence demonstrates that the States neces-\nsarily interpreted the government edicts doctrine correctly. I merely\npoint out that these divergent practices seriously undercut the majority\u2019s\nclaim that its interpretation of \u201cauthorship\u201d was well settled and univer-\nsally understood. On this score, the majority has no answer but to insin-\nuate that the lawmakers of over half the Nation\u2019s jurisdictions disre-\ngarded federal law and the Constitution to pursue their own agendas in\nthe face of supposedly clear precedent.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

In-\nstead, it simply repeats, without any further elaboration,\nits unsupported conclusion that \u201c[t]he Court long ago inter-\npreted the word \u2018author\u2019 to exclude officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law, and Congress has carried that\nmeaning forward in multiple iterations of the Copyright\nAct.\u201d Ante, at 16.

The majority finds it meaningful, for instance,\nthat Banks prohibited dissents and concurrences from be-\ning copyrighted, even though they carry no legal force.\nAnte, at 15. At an elementary level, it is true that the judg-\nment is the only part of a judicial decision that has legal\neffect. But it blinks reality to ignore that every word of a\njudicial opinion\u2014whether it is a majority, a concurrence, or\na dissent\u2014expounds upon the law in ways that do not map\nneatly on to the legislative function. Setting aside sum-\nmary decisions, the reader of a judicial opinion will always\ngain critical insight into the reasoning underlying a judicial\nholding by reading all opinions in their entirety.

Under the major-\nity\u2019s view, any one of these commissions or counsels could\npotentially be reclassified as an \u201cadjunct to the legislature.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. But the majority\u2019s test for ascertaining the true\nnature of these commissions raises far more questions than\nit answers.\n   The majority lists a number of factors\u2014including the\nCommission\u2019s membership and funding, how the annota-\ntions become part of the OCGA, and descriptions of the\nCommission from court cases\u2014to support its conclusion\nthat the Commission is really part of the legislature. See\nante, at 9\u201310. But it does not specify whether these factors\nare exhaustive or illustrative and, if the latter, what other\nfactors may be important. The majority also does not spec-\nify whether some factors weigh more heavily than others\nwhen deciding whether to deem an oversight body a legis-\nlative adjunct.\n   And even when the majority does list concrete factors,\npivotal guidance remains lacking. For example, the major-\nity finds it meaningful that 9 out of the Commission\u2019s 15\nmembers are legislators. Ante, at 9; see OCGA \u00a728\u20139\u20132\n(noting that the other members of the Commission include\nthe State\u2019s Lieutenant Governor, a judge, a district attor-\nney, and three other state bar members).

Perhaps, to the detriment\nof all, many States will stop producing annotated codes\naltogether. Were that to occur, the majority\u2019s fear of an\n\u201ceconomy-class\u201d version of the law will truly become a real-\nity. See ante, at 17. As Georgia explains, its contract ena-\nbles the OCGA to be sold at a fraction of the cost of compet-\ning annotated codes. For example, Georgia asserts that\nLexis sold the OCGA for $404 in 2016, while West Publish-\ning\u2019s competing annotated code sold for $2,570. Should\nstate annotated codes disappear, those without the means\nto pay the competitor\u2019s significantly higher price tag will\nhave a valuable research tool taken away from them.\nMeanwhile, this Court, which is privileged to have access to\nnumerous research resources, will scarcely notice.

The OCGA annotations, in my\nappraisal, do not rank as part of the Georgia Legislature\u2019s\nlawmaking process for three reasons.\n  First, the annotations are not created contemporaneously\nwith the statutes to which they pertain; instead, the anno-\ntations comment on statutes already enacted.

This sets the OCGA annota-\ntions apart from uncopyrightable legislative materials like\ncommittee reports, generated before a law\u2019s enactment, and\ntied tightly to the task of law-formulation.\n   Second, the OCGA annotations are descriptive rather\nthan prescriptive. Instead of stating the legislature\u2019s per-\nception of what a law conveys, the annotations summarize\nwritings in which others express their views on a given stat-\nute. For example, the OCGA contains \u201ccase annotations\u201d\nfor \u201c[a]ll decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the\nCourt of Appeals of Georgia and all decisions of the federal\ncourts in cases which arose in Georgia construing any por-\ntion of the general statutory law of the state.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 403.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">Per the Code Revision Commission\u2019s instructions, each an-\nnotation should \u201caccurately reflect the facts, holding, and\nstatutory construction\u201d adopted by the court.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 404.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">The annotations are neutrally cast; they do not opine on\nwhether the summarized case was correctly decided.

This characteristic of the annotations distin-\nguishes them from preenactment legislative materials that\ntouch or concern the correct interpretation of the legisla-\nture\u2019s work.\n   Third, and of prime importance, the OCGA annotations\nare \u201cgiven for the purpose of convenient reference\u201d by the\npublic, \u00a71\u20131\u20137 (2019); they aim to inform the citizenry at\nlarge, they do not address, particularly, those seated in leg-\nislative chambers.2 Annotations are thus unlike, for exam-\nple, surveys, work commissioned by a legislature to aid in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Suppose a committee of Georgia\u2019s legislature, to inform the public,\n\ninstructs a staffer to write a guide titled \u201cThe Workways of the Georgia\nLegislature.\u201d The final text describing how the legislature operates is\ncirculated to members of the legislature and approved by a majority.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s decision, I take it that such a work, which entails\nno lawmaking, would be copyrightable.\n\f4            GEORGIA v.

Argued December 9, 2019\u2014Decided April 20, 2020\nInter partes review is an administrative process that permits a patent\n  challenger to ask the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office to reconsider\n  the validity of earlier granted patent claims. For inter partes review\n  to proceed, the agency must agree to institute review. See 35 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7314. Among other conditions set by statute, if a request comes more\n  than a year after suit against the requesting party for patent infringe-\n  ment, \u201c[a]n inter partes review may not be instituted.\u201d \u00a7315(b). The\n  agency\u2019s \u201cdetermination . . . whether to institute an inter partes review\n  under this section shall be final and nonappealable.\u201d \u00a7314(d).\n     Entities associated with petitioner Thryv, Inc. sought inter partes\n  review of a patent owned by respondent Click-to-Call Technologies,\n  LP. Click-to-Call countered that the petition was untimely under\n  \u00a7315(b). The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) disagreed and\n  instituted review. After proceedings on the merits, the Board issued a\n  final written decision reiterating its \u00a7315(b) decision and canceling 13\n  of the patent\u2019s claims as obvious or lacking novelty. Click-to-Call ap-\n  pealed the Board\u2019s \u00a7315(b) determination. Treating the Board\u2019s appli-\n  cation of \u00a7315(b) as judicially reviewable, the Court of Appeals con-\n  cluded that the petition was untimely, vacated the Board\u2019s decision,\n  and remanded with instructions to dismiss.\nHeld: Section 314(d) precludes judicial review of the agency\u2019s application\n of \u00a7315(b)\u2019s time prescription. Pp. 6\u201314.\n    (a) A party generally cannot contend on appeal that the agency\n should have refused \u201cto institute an inter partes review.\u201d \u00a7314(d).\n That follows from \u00a7314(d)\u2019s text and Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC\n v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___. In Cuozzo, this Court explained that \u00a7314(d)\n \u201cpreclud[es] review of the Patent Office\u2019s institution decisions\u201d\u2014at\n\f2        THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    least \u201cwhere the grounds for attacking the decision to institute inter\n    partes review consist of questions that are closely tied to the applica-\n    tion and interpretation of statutes related to the Patent Office\u2019s deci-\n    sion to initiate inter partes review.\u201d Id., at ___. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) The question here is whether a challenge based on \u00a7315(b) ranks\n    as an appeal of the agency\u2019s decision \u201cto institute an inter partes re-\n    view.\u201d \u00a7314(d). There is no need to venture beyond Cuozzo\u2019s holding\n    that \u00a7314(d) bars review at least of matters \u201cclosely tied to the appli-\n    cation and interpretation of statutes related to\u201d the institution deci-\n    sion, 579 U. S., at ___. A \u00a7315(b) challenge easily meets that measure-\n    ment. Section 315(b), setting forth a circumstance in which \u201c[a]n inter\n    partes review may not be instituted,\u201d expressly governs institution and\n    nothing more. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (c) This conclusion is strongly reinforced by the statute\u2019s purpose\n    and design. Congress designed inter partes review to weed out bad\n    patent claims efficiently. Allowing \u00a7315(b) appeals, however, would\n    unwind agency proceedings determining patentability and leave bad\n    patents enforceable. Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (d) In Click-to-Call\u2019s view, \u00a7314(d)\u2019s bar on judicial review is limited\n    to the agency\u2019s threshold determination under \u00a7314(a) of the question\n    whether the petitioner has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing.\n    Cuozzo is fatal to that interpretation, for the Court in that case held\n    unreviewable the agency\u2019s application of a provision other than\n    \u00a7314(a). Contrary to Click-to-Call\u2019s contention, \u00a7314(d)\u2019s text does not\n    limit the review bar to \u00a7314(a). Rather than borrowing language from\n    related provisions that would have achieved Click-to-Call\u2019s preferred\n    meaning, Congress used broader language in \u00a7314(d). Click-to-Call\n    also insists that Congress intended judicial supervision of the agency\u2019s\n    application of \u00a7315(b), but the statute instead reflects a choice to en-\n    trust that issue to the agency. Finally, SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584\n    U. S. ___, offers Click-to-Call no assistance. Unlike the appeal held\n    reviewable in SAS Institute, Click-to-Call\u2019s appeal challenges not the\n    manner in which the agency\u2019s review proceeds once instituted, but\n    whether the agency should have instituted review at all. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (e) Click-to-Call argues in the alternative that its \u00a7315(b) objection\n    is authorized as an appeal from the Board\u2019s final written decision,\n    which addressed the \u00a7315(b) issue. Even labeled that way, Click-to-\n    Call\u2019s appeal is still barred by \u00a7314(d) because Click-to-Call\u2019s conten-\n    tion remains, essentially, that the agency should have refused to insti-\n    tute inter partes review.

S. Patent and Trade-\nmark Office (PTO) to reconsider the validity of earlier\ngranted patent claims. This case concerns a statutorily pre-\nscribed limitation of the issues a party may raise on appeal\nfrom an inter partes review proceeding.\n  When presented with a request for inter partes review,\nthe agency must decide whether to institute review. 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7314. Among other conditions set by statute, if the\nrequest comes more than a year after suit against the re-\nquesting party for patent infringement, \u201c[a]n inter partes\nreview may not be instituted.\u201d \u00a7315(b). \u201cThe determination\nby the [PTO] Director whether to institute an inter partes\nreview under this section shall be final and nonappealable.\u201d\n\u00a7314(d).\u2020\n  In this case, the agency instituted inter partes review in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  *JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE ALITO join all but Part III\u2013C of this\nopinion.\n  \u2020 Key statutory provisions are reproduced in an appendix to this opin-\nion.\n\f2     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nresponse to a petition from Thryv, Inc., resulting in the can-\ncellation of several patent claims. Patent owner Click-to-\nCall Technologies, LP, appealed, contending that Thryv\u2019s\npetition was untimely under \u00a7315(b).\n  The question before us: Does \u00a7314(d)\u2019s bar on judicial re-\nview of the agency\u2019s decision to institute inter partes review\npreclude Click-to-Call\u2019s appeal? Our answer is yes. The\nagency\u2019s application of \u00a7315(b)\u2019s time limit, we hold, is\nclosely related to its decision whether to institute inter\npartes review and is therefore rendered nonappealable by\n\u00a7314(d).\n                              I\n  The Patent and Trademark Office has several ways \u201cto\nreexamine\u2014and perhaps cancel\u2014a patent claim that it had\npreviously allowed.\u201d Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v.\nLee, 579 U.

Inter\npartes review allows third parties to challenge patent\nclaims on grounds of invalidity specified by statute.\n\u00a7311(b).\n  For inter partes review to proceed, the agency must agree\nto institute review. \u00a7314. Any person who is not the pat-\nent\u2019s owner may file a petition requesting inter partes re-\nview. \u00a7311(a). The patent owner may oppose institution of\ninter partes review, asserting the petition\u2019s \u201cfailure . . . to\nmeet any requirement of this chapter.\u201d \u00a7313.\n  The AIA sets out prerequisites for institution.

In 2013, petitioner Thryv sought\ninter partes review, challenging several of the patent\u2019s\nclaims.1\n   In opposition, Click-to-Call urged that \u00a7315(b) barred in-\nstitution of inter partes review because Thryv filed its peti-\ntion too late. Click-to-Call pointed to an infringement suit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 More precisely, the petition was filed by four companies, including\n\nYellowPages.com, LLC, and Ingenio, LLC.

CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfiled in 2001, which ended in a voluntary dismissal without\nprejudice.2 In Click-to-Call\u2019s view, that 2001 suit started\n\u00a7315(b)\u2019s one-year clock, making the 2013 petition\nuntimely.\n   The Board disagreed. Section 315(b) did not bar the in-\nstitution of inter partes review, the Board concluded, be-\ncause a complaint dismissed without prejudice does not\ntrigger \u00a7315(b)\u2019s one-year limit. Finding no other barrier to\ninstitution, the Board decided to institute review. After\nproceedings on the merits, the Board issued a final written\ndecision reiterating its rejection of Click-to-Call\u2019s \u00a7315(b)\nargument and canceling 13 of the patent\u2019s claims as obvious\nor lacking novelty.\n   Click-to-Call appealed, challenging only the Board\u2019s de-\ntermination that \u00a7315(b) did not preclude inter partes re-\nview. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction, agreeing with Thryv and the Director (who in-\ntervened on appeal) that \u00a7314(d)\u2019s bar on appeal of the in-\nstitution decision precludes judicial review of the agency\u2019s\napplication of \u00a7315(b). Citing our intervening decision in\nCuozzo, see infra, at 6\u20137, we granted certiorari, vacated the\njudgment, and remanded. Click-to-Call Technologies, LP v.\nOracle Corp., 579 U. S. ___ (2016). On remand, the Court\nof Appeals again dismissed the appeal on the same ground.\n   Thereafter, in another case, the en banc Federal Circuit\nheld that \u201ctime-bar determinations under \u00a7315(b) are ap-\npealable\u201d notwithstanding \u00a7314(d).

Wi-Fi One, 878 F. 3d, at\n1374\u20131375. In a concurring opinion, Judge O\u2019Malley\nemphasized a \u201csimpler\u201d basis for the same conclusion. Id.,\nat 1375. In her view, \u00a7314(d) shields from review only the\nagency\u2019s assessment of a petition\u2019s \u201csubstantive adequacy,\u201d\nnot questions about the agency\u2019s \u201cauthority to act.\u201d Id., at\n1376.\n   Judge Hughes, joined by Judges Lourie, Bryson, and Dyk,\ndissented, expressing a position that today\u2019s dissent\ncharacterizes as \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Post, at 6. Those judges\nconcluded that \u00a7314(d) conveys Congress\u2019 \u201cclear and\nunmistakable\u201d \u201cintent to prohibit judicial review of the\nBoard\u2019s [inter partes review] institution decision.\u201d Wi-Fi\nOne, 878 F. 3d, at 1378. That prohibition applies to \u00a7315(b)\nissues, the Federal Circuit dissenters maintained, because\n\u00a7315(b) \u201cdescribes when an [inter partes review] may be\n\u2018instituted.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1377, 1378\u20131379 (quoting \u00a7315(b)).\n   In light of its en banc decision in Wi-Fi One, the Court of\nAppeals granted panel rehearing in this case. Treating the\nBoard\u2019s application of \u00a7315(b) as judicially reviewable, the\npanel\u2019s revised opinion held that the Board erred by insti-\ntuting review. The petition for inter partes review here was\nuntimely, the Court of Appeals held, because the 2001 in-\nfringement complaint, though dismissed without prejudice,\nstarted the one-year clock under \u00a7315(b).3 The court there-\nfore vacated the Board\u2019s final written decision, which had\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 A footnote in the panel\u2019s opinion noted that the Court of Appeals sit-\n\f6      THRYV, INC. v.

Section 314(d)\u2019s text ren-\nders \u201cfinal and nonappealable\u201d the \u201cdetermination by the\nDirector whether to institute an inter partes review under\nthis section.\u201d \u00a7314(d) (emphasis added). That language in-\ndicates that a party generally cannot contend on appeal\nthat the agency should have refused \u201cto institute an inter\npartes review.\u201d\n   We held as much in Cuozzo. There, a party contended on\nappeal that the agency should have refused to institute in-\nter partes review because the petition failed \u00a7312(a)(3)\u2019s re-\nquirement that the grounds for challenging patent claims\nmust be identified \u201cwith particularity.\u201d 579 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\n\u201ccontention that the Patent Office unlawfully initiated its\nagency review is not appealable,\u201d we held, for \u201cthat is what\n\u00a7314(d) says.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7).

Instead, we defined the bounds of\nour holding this way: \u201c[O]ur interpretation applies where\nthe grounds for attacking the decision to institute inter\npartes review consist of questions that are closely tied to\nthe application and interpretation of statutes related to the\nPatent Office\u2019s decision to initiate inter partes review.\u201d\nIbid.\n                                 B\n  We therefore ask whether a challenge based on \u00a7315(b)\nranks as an appeal of the agency\u2019s decision \u201cto institute an\ninter partes review.\u201d \u00a7314(d). We need not venture beyond\nCuozzo\u2019s holding that \u00a7314(d) bars review at least of mat-\nters \u201cclosely tied to the application and interpretation of\nstatutes related to\u201d the institution decision, 579 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 11), for a \u00a7315(b) challenge easily meets that\nmeasurement.\n  Section 315(b)\u2019s time limitation is integral to, indeed a\ncondition on, institution. After all, \u00a7315(b) sets forth a cir-\ncumstance in which \u201c[a]n inter partes review may not be\ninstituted.\u201d Even Click-to-Call and the Court of Appeals\nrecognize that \u00a7315(b) governs institution. See Brief for Re-\nspondent Click-to-Call 1 (\u00a7315(b) is \u201ca clear limit on the\nBoard\u2019s institution authority\u201d); Wi-Fi One, 878 F. 3d, at\n\f8      THRYV, INC. v.

A challenge to a pe-\ntition\u2019s timeliness under \u00a7315(b) thus raises \u201can ordinary\ndispute about the application of \u201d an institution-related\nstatute. Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). In this\ncase as in Cuozzo, therefore, \u00a7314(d) overcomes the pre-\nsumption favoring judicial review.4\n                               C\n   The AIA\u2019s purpose and design strongly reinforce our con-\nclusion. By providing for inter partes review, Congress,\nconcerned about overpatenting and its diminishment of\ncompetition, sought to weed out bad patent claims effi-\nciently. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 8); H. R. Rep. No. 112\u2013\n98, pt. 1, p. 40 (2011) (\u201cThe legislation is designed to estab-\nlish a more efficient and streamlined patent system that\nwill improve patent quality and limit unnecessary and\ncounterproductive litigation costs.\u201d).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 We do not decide whether mandamus would be available in an ex-\n\ntraordinary case.

Yet the dissent, despite the Court\u2019s decision upholding the constitu-\ntionality of such review in Oil States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene\u2019s\nEnergy Group, LLC, 584 U.

S. ____ (2020)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Allowing \u00a7315(b) appeals would tug against that objec-\ntive, wasting the resources spent resolving patentability\nand leaving bad patents enforceable. A successful \u00a7315(b)\nappeal would terminate in vacatur of the agency\u2019s decision;\nin lieu of enabling judicial review of patentability, vacatur\nwould unwind the agency\u2019s merits decision. See Cuozzo,\n579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). And because a patent owner\nwould need to appeal on \u00a7315(b) untimeliness grounds only\nif she could not prevail on patentability, \u00a7315(b) appeals\nwould operate to save bad patent claims. This case illus-\ntrates the dynamic. The agency held Click-to-Call\u2019s patent\nclaims invalid, and Click-to-Call does not contest that hold-\ning. It resists only the agency\u2019s institution decision, mind-\nful that if the institution decision is reversed, then the\nagency\u2019s work will be undone and the canceled patent\nclaims resurrected.\n   Other features of the statutory design confirm that Con-\ngress prioritized patentability over \u00a7315(b)\u2019s timeliness re-\nquirement. A petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \u00a7315(b) does not\nprevent the agency from conducting inter partes review of\nthe challenged patent claims; the agency can do so at an-\nother petitioner\u2019s request. \u00a7311(a). Nor does failure to sat-\nisfy \u00a7315(b) prevent the original initiator from participating\non the merits; the \u00a7315(b)-barred party can join a proceed-\ning initiated by another petitioner. \u00a7315(b), (c). And once\ninter partes review is instituted, the agency may issue a fi-\nnal written decision even \u201c[i]f no petitioner remains in the\ninter partes review.\u201d \u00a7317(a). It is unsurprising that a stat-\nutory scheme so consistently elevating resolution of patent-\nability above a petitioner\u2019s compliance with \u00a7315(b) would\nexclude \u00a7315(b) appeals, thereby preserving the Board\u2019s ad-\njudication of the merits.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhonest count on first view, but a jaundiced one on second look? See post,\nat 19\u201320.\n\f10    THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Judicial review of \u00a7315(b) rulings, moreover, would do lit-\ntle to serve other statutory goals. The purpose of \u00a7315(b),\nall agree, is to minimize burdensome overlap between inter\npartes review and patent-infringement litigation. Brief for\nPetitioner 24; Brief for Federal Respondent 36; Brief for Re-\nspondent Click-to-Call 37. Judicial review after the agency\nproceedings cannot undo the burdens already occasioned.\nNor are \u00a7315(b) appeals necessary to protect patent claims\nfrom wrongful invalidation, for patent owners remain free\nto appeal final decisions on the merits. \u00a7319.\n                              IV\n   Click-to-Call advances a narrower reading of \u00a7314(d). In\nClick-to-Call\u2019s view, which the dissent embraces, post, at 6\u2013\n18, the bar on judicial review applies only to the agency\u2019s\nthreshold determination under \u00a7314(a) of the question\nwhether the petitioner has a reasonable likelihood of pre-\nvailing. Section 314(d) addresses the \u201cdetermination by the\nDirector whether to institute inter partes review under this\nsection\u201d (emphasis added), and, Click-to-Call maintains,\n\u00a7314(a) contains \u201cthe only substantive determination refer-\nenced in\u201d the same section as \u00a7314(d). Brief for Respondent\nClick-to-Call 16. This interpretation, Click-to-Call argues,\nsupplies a clear rule consonant with the presumption favor-\ning judicial review. Cf. supra, at 4\u20135 (Federal Circuit\u2019s en\nbanc Wi-Fi One decision).\n   Cuozzo is fatal to Click-to-Call\u2019s interpretation. Section\n314(d)\u2019s review bar is not confined to the agency\u2019s applica-\ntion of \u00a7314(a), for in Cuozzo we held unreviewable the\nagency\u2019s application of \u00a7312(a)(3). 579 U. S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 7\u20138). Far from limiting the appeal bar to\n\u00a7314(a) and \u201cnothing else\u201d as Click-to-Call urges, Brief for\nRespondent 29, the Court\u2019s opinion in Cuozzo explained\nthat the bar extends to challenges grounded in \u201cstatutes re-\nlated to\u201d the institution decision. 579 U.

S. ____ (2020)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The text of \u00a7314(d) offers Click-to-Call no support. The\nprovision sweeps more broadly than the determination\nabout whether \u201cthere is a reasonable likelihood that the pe-\ntitioner would prevail.\u201d \u00a7314(a). Rather, it encompasses\nthe entire determination \u201cwhether to institute an inter\npartes review.\u201d \u00a7314(d).\n   And \u00a7314(d) refers not to a determination under subsec-\ntion (a), but to the determination \u201cunder this section.\u201d That\nphrase indicates that \u00a7314 governs the Director\u2019s institu-\ntion of inter partes review. Titled \u201cInstitution of inter\npartes review,\u201d \u00a7314 is the section housing the command to\nthe Director to \u201cdetermine whether to institute an inter\npartes review,\u201d \u00a7314(b). Thus, every decision to institute is\nmade \u201cunder\u201d \u00a7314 but must take account of specifications\nin other provisions\u2014such as the \u00a7312(a)(3) particularity re-\nquirement at issue in Cuozzo and the \u00a7315(b) timeliness re-\nquirement at issue here. Similar clarifying language recurs\nthroughout the AIA. See, e.g., \u00a7315(c) (referring to the Di-\nrector\u2019s determination regarding \u201cthe institution of an inter\npartes review under section 314\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7314(b)\n(referring to \u201ca petition filed under section 311,\u201d the section\nauthorizing the filing of petitions (emphasis added));\n\u00a7314(b)(1) (referring to \u201ca preliminary response to the peti-\ntion under section 313,\u201d the section authorizing the filing of\npreliminary responses to petitions (emphasis added)).\n   If Congress had intended Click-to-Call\u2019s meaning, it had\nat hand readymade language from a precursor to \u00a7314(d):\n\u201cA determination by the Director under subsection (a) shall\nbe final and non-appealable.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7312(c) (2006 ed.)\n(emphasis added) (governing inter partes reexamination).\nOr Congress might have borrowed from a related provision:\n\u201cA determination by the Director pursuant to subsection (a)\nof this section that no substantial new question of patenta-\nbility has been raised will be final and nonappealable.\u201d 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7303(c) (emphasis added) (governing ex parte reex-\n\f12    THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\namination). Instead, Congress chose to shield from appel-\nlate review the determination \u201cwhether to institute an inter\npartes review under this section.\u201d \u00a7314(d) (emphasis\nadded). That departure in language suggests a departure\nin meaning. See Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.,\n582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6).\n   Click-to-Call doubts that Congress would have limited\nthe agency\u2019s institution authority in \u00a7315(b) without ensur-\ning judicial supervision. Congress entrusted the institution\ndecision to the agency, however, to avoid the significant\ncosts, already recounted, of nullifying a thoroughgoing de-\ntermination about a patent\u2019s validity. See supra, at 8\u20139.\nThat goal\u2014preventing appeals that would frustrate effi-\ncient resolution of patentability\u2014extends beyond \u00a7314(a)\nappeals.\n   Click-to-Call also contends that we adopted its interpre-\ntation of \u00a7314(d) in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___\n(2018). Neither of our holdings in that case assists Click-\nto-Call, and both holdings remain governing law. SAS In-\nstitute first held that once the agency institutes an inter\npartes review, it must \u201cresolve all of the claims in the case.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 1). SAS Institute located that rule in\n\u00a7318(a), which requires the agency to decide \u201cthe patenta-\nbility of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner.\u201d\nIbid. (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omit-\nted). SAS Institute next held that \u00a7314(d) did not bar judi-\ncial review of \u00a7318(a)\u2019s application.

That reviewability hold-\ning is inapplicable here, for Click-to-Call\u2019s appeal chal-\nlenges not the manner in which the agency\u2019s review\n\u201cproceeds\u201d once instituted, but whether the agency should\nhave instituted review at all.\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Recall that Cuozzo itself applied \u00a7314(d)\u2019s appeal bar\nto a challenge on grounds other than \u00a7314(a). See supra, at\n10. To understand how far beyond \u00a7314(a) the bar on judi-\ncial review extends, we look to the statute and Cuozzo; for\nthe reasons stated above, they establish that \u00a7314(d) bars\nchallenges resting on \u00a7315(b).6\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Defending Click-to-Call\u2019s interpretation, the dissent takes a view of\n\nour precedent that neither Click-to-Call nor the Federal Circuit ad-\nvances. See post, at 15\u201318. The dissent does not consider itself bound\nby Cuozzo\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7314(d) bars appeal of \u201cquestions that are\nclosely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to\nthe Patent Office\u2019s decision to initiate inter partes review,\u201d 579 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 11). According to the dissent, that statement is dicta\nlater repudiated in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___ (2018).\n   But Cuozzo concerned an appeal resting on a \u201crelated statutory sec-\ntion\u201d: \u00a7312(a)(3). 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). That \u00a7312(a)(3)\nchallenge was tied to institution, the Court explained, for two reasons:\nfirst, because it \u201cattack[ed] a \u2018determination . . . whether to institute\u2019\nreview,\u201d id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138); second, because the \u00a7312(a)(3)\nchallenge was related to invoking \u00a7314(a)\u2019s condition on institution, id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12). Cuozzo\u2019s recognition that \u00a7314(d) can bar chal-\nlenges rooted in provisions other than \u00a7314(a) was hardly \u201cdicta,\u201d post,\nat 16\u2014it was the Court\u2019s holding. And SAS Institute purported to adhere\nto Cuozzo, not to overrule it. 584 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 13\u201314).\nThe Court in SAS Institute said, specifically, that it discerned \u201cnothing\nin . . . Cuozzo\u201d inconsistent with its conclusion. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14).\n   We do not so lightly treat our determinations as dicta and our decisions\nas overruling others sub silentio. Nor can we countenance the dissent\u2019s\ndangerous insinuation that today\u2019s decision is not \u201creally\u201d binding prec-\nedent.

The\nBoard\u2019s final written decision addressed the \u00a7315(b) issue,\nso Click-to-Call argues that it may appeal under \u00a7319,\nwhich authorizes appeal from the final written decision.\nBut even labeled as an appeal from the final written deci-\nsion, Click-to-Call\u2019s attempt to overturn the Board\u2019s \u00a7315(b)\nruling is still barred by \u00a7314(d). Because \u00a7315(b)\u2019s sole of-\nfice is to govern institution, Click-to-Call\u2019s contention re-\nmains, essentially, that the agency should have refused to\ninstitute inter partes review. As explained, \u00a7314(d) makes\nthat contention unreviewable.\n                       *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and\nremand the case with instructions to dismiss for lack of ap-\npellate jurisdiction.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourts alike will just have to wait and see.\u201d). Lest any \u201cconfusion\u201d re-\nmain, post, at 17, we reaffirm today our holding in Cuozzo: Section 314(d)\ngenerally precludes appeals of the agency\u2019s institution decision, includ-\ning, beyond genuine debate, appeals \u201cconsist[ing] of questions that are\nclosely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to\u201d\nthe institution decision. 579 U.

Worse, the Court closes the court-\nhouse not in a case where the patent owner is merely un-\nhappy with the merits of the agency\u2019s decision but where\nthe owner claims the agency\u2019s proceedings were unlawful\nfrom the start. Most remarkably, the Court denies judicial\nreview even though the government now concedes that the\npatent owner is right and this entire exercise in property-\ntaking-by-bureaucracy was forbidden by law.\n  It might be one thing if Congress clearly ordained this\nstrange result. But it did not. The relevant statute, the\npresumption of judicial review, and our precedent all point\ntoward allowing, not forbidding, inventors their day in\ncourt. Yet, the Court brushes past these warning signs and,\nin the process, carries us another step down the road of ced-\ning core judicial powers to agency officials and leaving the\ndisposition of private rights and liberties to bureaucratic\nmercy.\n\f2     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n                                I\n   Our story stretches back to the 1990s, when Stephen Du-\nVal invented a system for anonymizing telephone calls. Be-\nlieving in the promise of his idea, Mr. DuVal hired an attor-\nney to secure a patent and sought avenues to bring his\ninvention to market. Initially, both efforts met with suc-\ncess. In 1998, Mr. DuVal was awarded a U. S. Patent,\nwhich he licensed to a company called InfoRocket.com, Inc.\n   But problems soon emerged. In 2001, InfoRocket accused\nIngenio, Inc., a predecessor of today\u2019s petitioner Thryv, Inc.,\nof infringing Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent. The case carried on in\nfederal district court for more than a year before InfoRocket\nand Ingenio decided to merge. The companies then jointly\npersuaded the court to dismiss InfoRocket\u2019s lawsuit without\nprejudice.\n   Still, the quiet did not last long. Following the merger,\nthe surviving entity\u2014for simplicity, call it Thryv\u2014sought\nto turn the tables on Mr. DuVal by asking the Patent Office\nto reconsider the validity of his patent in an ex parte reex-\namination. That agency-led process dragged on for four\nmore years, and ended with a mixed verdict: The Patent\nOffice canceled a few claims, but amended others and per-\nmitted Mr. DuVal to add some new ones too.\n   Even the ex parte reexamination wasn\u2019t enough to put\nthe parties\u2019 disputes to rest. During the reexamination,\nThryv terminated its license with Mr. DuVal and stopped\npaying him royalties. But it seems that Thryv continued\nusing the patented technology all the same. So Mr. Duval\ntransferred his patent to respondent Click-to-Call Technol-\nogies LP (CTC), which swiftly took the patent back to court.\nCTC noted that Thryv couldn\u2019t exactly plead ignorance\nabout this patent, given that the company or its predeces-\nsors had previously licensed the patent, been sued for in-\nfringing it, and asked the Patent Office to reexamine it.\nWhen it came to Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent, CTC alleged, Thryv\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nhad done just about everything one can do to a patent ex-\ncept invent it.\n   Thryv responded by opening another new litigation front\nof its own. One year after CTC filed its federal lawsuit,\nThryv lodged another administrative petition with the Pat-\nent Office, this time seeking inter partes review. Echoing\nsome of the same arguments that led to its push for an\nex parte administrative reexamination nine years earlier,\nand adding other arguments too, Thryv (again) asked the\nagency to cancel Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent on the grounds that it\nlacked novelty and was obvious. At the same time, Thryv\nsought to stay proceedings in CTC\u2019s infringement suit.\nThryv argued that the district court should defer to the\nnewly initiated inter partes review. Like many district\ncourts facing the prospect of parallel administrative pro-\nceedings, this one obliged.\n   Why at this late hour did Thryv prefer to litigate before\nthe agency rather than a federal district court? The\nagency\u2019s ex parte reexamination years earlier hadn\u2019t helped\nThryv much. But since then, Congress had adopted the\nLeahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), 35 U. S. C. \u00a7100\net seq. That law created the inter partes review process,\nwhich provides a number of benefits to accused infringers\nsuch as Thryv. Like federal court litigation, inter partes\nreview holds the advantage of allowing a private party at-\ntacking a patent\u2019s validity to participate in adversarial pro-\nceedings, rather than rely on the agency to direct its own\ninvestigation as it does in ex parte reexamination. Com-\npare 35 U. S. C. \u00a7316 with \u00a7\u00a7302, 304, 305. Inter partes\nreview also allows a party challenging a patent all manner\nof discovery, including depositions and the presentation of\nexpert testimony. \u00a7316; 37 CFR \u00a7\u00a742.51\u201342.65 (2019). At\nthe same time, the burden of proof is lower\u2014requiring chal-\nlengers like Thryv to prove unpatentability only by a pre-\nponderance of the evidence, \u00a7316(e), rather than under the\nclear and convincing standard that usually applies in court.\n\f4     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nMicrosoft Corp. v. i4i L. P., 564 U. S. 91 (2011). Perhaps\nmost appealing, proceedings take place before the Patent\nTrial and Appeal Board, rather than in an Article III court,\nso there is no jury trial before a tenure-protected judge, only\na hearing before a panel of agency employees.\n   Some say the new regime represents a particularly\nefficient new way to \u201ckill\u201d patents. Certainly, the numbers\ntell an inviting story for petitioners like Thryv. In approx-\nimately 80% of cases reaching a final decision, the\nBoard cancels some or all of the challenged claims.\nPatent Trial and Appeal Board, Trial Statistics 10 (Feb.\n2020), https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/\nTrial_Statistics_2020_02_29.pdf. The Board has been busy,\ntoo, instituting more than 800 of these new proceedings\nevery year. See id., at 6.\n   Still, Thryv faced a hurdle. Inter partes review \u201cmay not\nbe instituted\u201d based on an administrative petition filed\nmore than a year after \u201cthe petitioner, real party in inter-\nest, or privy of the petitioner is served with a complaint al-\nleging infringement of the patent\u201d in federal court. 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7315(b). So, while Congress sought to move many\ncases out of court and into its new administrative process,\nit thought patent owners who have already endured long\nchallenges in court shouldn\u2019t have to face another layer of\nadministrative review. After all, some repose is due inven-\ntors. Patents typically last 20 years; what happens to the\nincentive to invent if litigation over them lasts even longer\n(as it has for Mr. DuVal)? By anyone\u2019s estimation, too,\n\u00a7315(b)\u2019s time bar was sure to pose a special problem for\nThryv. Yes, Thryv had petitioned for inter partes review\none year after being served with CTC\u2019s complaint. But\nnearly 12 years had passed since Thryv\u2019s predecessor and\nprivy first found itself on the business end of a lawsuit al-\nleging that it had infringed Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent.\n   Despite this apparently fatal defect, the Board plowed\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            5\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nahead anyway. No one could dispute that Thryv\u2019s predeces-\nsor and privy had been \u201cserved with a complaint alleging\ninfringement of the patent\u201d more than a decade earlier. But\nthat complaint didn\u2019t count, the Board declared, because it\nwas dismissed without prejudice. The Board cited nothing\nin \u00a7315(b) suggesting this distinction makes a difference\nunder the statute\u2019s plain terms. Instead, the Board tiptoed\npast the problem and proceeded to invalidate almost all of\nthe patent claims before it, even those the Patent Office it-\nself had affirmed in its own ex parte proceeding years be-\nfore. No doubt this was exactly what Thryv hoped for in its\nsecond bite at the administrative apple.\n  Thryv\u2019s victory may have taken years to achieve, but it\ndidn\u2019t seem calculated to last long. Predictably, CTC ap-\npealed the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7315(b) to the Federal\nCircuit. And just as unsurprisingly, the court held that dis-\nmissed complaints do count as complaints, so Thryv\u2019s inter\npartes administrative challenge was time barred from the\nstart. Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent had already survived one\nex parte reexamination Thryv instigated. The patent had\nbeen the subject of long and repeated litigation in federal\ncourts. The agency had no business opening yet another\nnew inquiry into this very old patent.\n  But Thryv had one maneuver left. It sought review in\nthis Court, insisting that Article III courts lack authority\neven to say what the law demands. According to Thryv, a\ndifferent provision, \u00a7314(d), renders the agency\u2019s interpre-\ntations and applications of \u00a7315(b) immune from judicial re-\nview. So the Board can err; it can even act in defiance of\nplain congressional limits on its authority. But, in Thryv\u2019s\nview, a court can do nothing about it. Enforcement of\n\u00a7315(b)\u2019s time bar falls only to the very Patent Office offi-\ncials whose authority it seeks to restrain. Inventors like\nMr. DuVal just have to hope that the bureaucracy revoking\ntheir property rights will take the extra trouble of doing so\nin accordance with law.\n\f6     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n  That\u2019s the strange place we now find ourselves. Thryv\nmanaged to persuade the Court to grant its petition for\ncertiorari to consider its extraordinary argument. And\ntoday the Court vindicates its last and most remarkable\nmaneuver.\n                              II\n                              A\n   How could \u00a7314(d) insulate from judicial review the\nagency\u2019s\u2014admittedly mistaken\u2014interpretation of an en-\ntirely different provision, \u00a7315(b)? The answer is that it\ndoesn\u2019t.\n   To see why, look no further than \u00a7314(d). The statute\ntells us that \u201c[t]he determination by the Director whether\nto institute an inter partes review under this section shall\nbe final and nonappealable.\u201d So the only thing \u00a7314(d) in-\nsulates from judicial review is \u201c[t]he determination\u201d made\n\u201cby the Director\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d\u2014that is, a determina-\ntion discussed within \u00a7314. Nothing in the statute insu-\nlates agency interpretations of other provisions outside\n\u00a7314, including those involving \u00a7315(b).\n   This arrangement makes sense. Given that \u00a7314(d)\nspeaks of \u201c[t]he\u201d determination by the Director \u201cunder this\nsection,\u201d it comes as no surprise that the section mentions\njust one such \u201cdetermination.\u201d It is found in \u00a7314(a), where\nthe Director \u201cdetermines\u201d whether the parties\u2019 initial plead-\nings suggest \u201ca reasonable likelihood\u201d the petitioner will\nprevail in defeating at least some aspect of the challenged\npatent. And it is easy to see why Congress might make a\npreliminary merits assessment like that exempt from fur-\nther view: If the Director institutes a meritless petition, the\nBoard can summarily affirm the patent\u2019s validity. See\n\u00a7318(a); 37 CFR \u00a7\u00a742.71\u201342.73. In any event, the Board is\nobligated to render a final\u2014and judicially reviewable\u2014de-\ncision within a year. 35 U. S.

So judicial review of the Director\u2019s initial ap-\npraisal of the merits isn\u2019t really eliminated as much as it is\nchanneled toward the Board\u2019s final decision on those mer-\nits. That process finds a ready analogue elsewhere in our\nlaw. Much as here, an indicted criminal defendant un-\nhappy with a grand jury\u2019s finding of probable cause isn\u2019t\npermitted to challenge that preliminary assessment, but\nmay instead move the court for acquittal after the govern-\nment has presented all its evidence. See Costello v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 359, 363 (1956); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n29(a).\n   Matters outside \u00a7314 are different. Take the provision\nbefore us, \u00a7315(b). It promises that an inter partes review\n\u201cmay not be instituted\u201d more than a year after the initiation\nof litigation. This stands as an affirmative limit on the\nagency\u2019s authority. Much like a statute of limitations, this\nprovision supplies an argument a party can continue to\npress throughout the life of the administrative proceeding\nand on appeal. Nothing in \u00a7315(b) speaks of a \u201cdeter-\nmination by the Director,\u201d let alone suggests that the\nagency\u2019s initial ruling on a petition\u2019s timeliness is \u201cfinal and\nnonappealable.\u201d\n   To pretend otherwise would invite a linguistic nonsense.\nWe would have to read \u00a7314\u2019s language speaking of \u201c[t]he\u201d\n\u201cdetermination\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d to include not one de-\ntermination but two\u2014and to include not only the determi-\nnation actually made under \u201cthis section\u201d but also a second\nassessment made about the effect of an entirely different\nsection.\n   To pretend otherwise would invite a practical nonsense\nas well. Because the Director\u2019s initial \u201creasonable likeli-\nhood\u201d determination under \u00a7314(a) relates to the merits, it\nwill be effectively reviewed both by the Board and courts as\nthe case progresses. But when does the Director\u2019s applica-\ntion of \u00a7315(b)\u2019s time bar get another look? Under Thryv\u2019s\ninterpretation, a provision that reads like an affirmative\n\f8     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nlimit on the agency\u2019s authority reduces to a mere sugges-\ntion. No matter how wrong or even purposefully evasive,\nthe Director\u2019s assessment of a petition\u2019s timeliness is al-\nways immune from review. And even that\u2019s not the end of\nit. In other cases, the Board has claimed it has the right to\nreview these initial timeliness decisions, and Thryv seems\ncontent with those rulings. See, e.g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Rob-\nert Bosch Healthcare Systems, Inc., 839 F. 3d 1382 (CA Fed.\n2016). So it turns out the company doesn\u2019t really want to\nmake an initial administrative timeliness decisions final; it\njust wants to make them unreviewable in court, defying\nonce more \u00a7314\u2019s plain language and any rational explana-\ntion, except maybe as an expedient to win the day\u2019s case.\n                              B\n   Confronting so many problems in the statute\u2019s text,\nThryv seeks a way around them by offering a competing ac-\ncount of the law\u2019s operation. While \u00a7314 empowers the Di-\nrector to make an institution decision, Thryv asserts that\nvarious provisions scattered throughout the chapter\u2014such\nas \u00a7\u00a7314(a), 315(a)(1), and 315(b)\u2014help guide the decision.\nAnd on Thryv\u2019s interpretation, all questions related to the\nDirector\u2019s institution decision should be insulated from re-\nview, no matter where those rules are found. What about\nthe fact \u00a7314 speaks of insulating only \u201c[t]he\u201d \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d? Thryv says this language serves\nmerely to indicate which institution authority is unreview-\nable\u2014namely, the Director\u2019s authority to institute an inter\npartes proceeding pursuant to \u00a7314, rather than pursuant\nto some other provision.\n   This interpretation, however, makes a nullity of the very\nlanguage it purports to explain. Section 314 is the only sec-\ntion that authorizes the Director to institute inter partes\nreview, making it pointless for Congress to tell us that we\u2019re\ntalking about the Director\u2019s \u00a7314 inter partes review insti-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

In fact, you can strike \u201cunder\nthis section\u201d from \u00a7314(d) and Thryv\u2019s interpretation re-\nmains unchanged. That\u2019s a pretty good clue something has\ngone wrong.\n   Faced with this problem of surplusage, Thryv alludes to\nthe possibility that Congress included redundant language\nto be \u201cdouble sure.\u201d But double sure of what? Thryv does\nnot identify any confusion that the phrase \u201cunder this sec-\ntion\u201d might help avoid. Given the lack of any other provi-\nsion, anywhere in the U. S. Code, authorizing anyone to in-\nstitute inter partes review, even the most obtuse reader\nwould never have any use for the clarification supposedly\nprovided by \u201cunder this section\u201d on Thryv\u2019s account.\n   Maybe so, Thryv replies, but we shouldn\u2019t worry about\nthe surplusage here because the AIA contains surplusage\nelsewhere. The other putative examples of surplusage\nThryv identifies, however, have no bearing on the provision\nnow before us. And even a passing glance reveals no sur-\nplusage in them either. Consider \u00a7315(c). It says that \u201cthe\nDirector, in his or her discretion, may join as a party to that\ninter partes review any person who properly files a petition\nunder section 311 that the Director, after receiving a pre-\nliminary response under section 313 . . . , determines war-\nrants the institution of an inter partes review under section\n314.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thryv argues that all these cross-\nreferences are unnecessary. But look closely: Each of\n\u00a7315(c)\u2019s cross-references does important work to establish\nthe rules for joinder. Strike the first and the requirements\nof a joinder petition become undefined. Strike the second\nand it\u2019s a mystery what kind of response the patent owner\nis entitled to file. Strike the third and the Director\u2019s deter-\nmination whether to grant joinder becomes standardless.\nAll of this language has a point to it\u2014just as \u201cunder this\nsection\u201d does under a faithful interpretation of \u00a7314(d).\n   That leaves Thryv only one more tenuous textual lifeline\n\f10    THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nleft to toss. If Congress had wanted to insulate from review\nonly \u201c[t]he\u201d \u201cdetermination\u201d that a petition has a \u201creason-\nable likelihood\u201d of success, the company suggests, Congress\ncould have spoken of insulating \u201cthe determination under\nsubsection (a)\u201d rather than \u201cthe determination under this\nsection.\u201d And Thryv reminds us that Congress used that\nlatter formulation in nearby and predecessor statutes. See,\ne.g., \u00a7303(c) (\u201c[a] determination by the Director pursuant to\nsubsection (a) of this section . . . will be final and nonappeal-\nable\u201d); \u00a7312(c) (2006 ed.; repealed 2011) (\u201c[a] determination\nby the Director under subsection (a) shall be final and\nnon-appealable\u201d).\n   But so what? One could replace the phrase \u201cmy next-door\nneighbor to the west\u201d with \u201cmy neighbor at 123 Main\nStreet\u201d (assuming that is her address) and the meaning\nwould be the same. Likewise, it hardly matters whether\nCongress spoke of the \u201cdetermination\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d\nor \u201cunder subsection (a).\u201d Either way, our attention is di-\nrected within, not beyond, \u00a7314. And what\u2019s Thryv\u2019s alter-\nnative? It would have us read language speaking of the Di-\nrector\u2019s determination \u201cunder this section\u201d to encompass\nany decision related to the initiation of inter partes review\nfound anywhere in the AIA\u2014an entire chapter of the U. S.\nCode. That\u2019s sort of like reading \u201cmy next-door neighbor to\nthe west\u201d to include \u201canyone in town.\u201d Nor do things get\nbetter for Thryv with a careful assessment of nearby and\npredecessor statutes. They reveal that Congress knew ex-\nactly how to give broader directions like the one Thryv ima-\ngines when it wished to do so. See, e.g., \u00a7314(b) (directing\nour attention to the Director\u2019s decision whether to institute\ninter partes review \u201cunder this chapter\u201d rather than \u201cunder\nthis section\u201d).\n   Without any plausible textual or contextual hook for its\nposition, Thryv finishes by advancing a parade of policy\nhorribles. It notes that the AIA imposes lots of other con-\nstraints on inter partes review besides the \u00a7315(b) timing\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nprovision now before us. For example, the law bars peti-\ntioners who have filed declaratory judgment actions from\nchallenging the same patent in inter partes review proceed-\nings, \u00a7315(a)(1), and it estops petitioners from seeking other\nforms of review once an inter partes proceeding finishes,\n\u00a7315(e). If courts are going to review the agency\u2019s applica-\ntion of \u00a7315(b), Thryv wonders, are they going to have to\nreview the agency\u2019s application of these other provisions\ntoo?\n   But we could just as easily march this parade in the op-\nposite direction. Even assuming (without deciding) that\nThryv is right and the reviewability of all these provisions\nstands or falls together, that seems at least as good an ar-\ngument for as against judicial review. If so much more is\nat stake, if many more kinds of agency errors could be insu-\nlated from correction, isn\u2019t that a greater reason to pay as-\nsiduous attention to the statute\u2019s terms? Surely, Thryv\u2019s\nprofessed concern for judicial economy supplies no license\nto ignore our duty to decide the cases properly put to us in\naccord with the statute\u2019s terms.\n                              III\n   This last point leads to another reason why we should re-\nject Thryv\u2019s reading of the statute. Even if the company\ncould muster some doubt about the reach of \u00a7314(d), it\nwouldn\u2019t be enough to overcome the \u201cwell-settled presump-\ntion favoring interpretations of statutes that allow judicial\nreview of administrative action.\u201d McNary v. Haitian Refu-\ngee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496 (1991). As this Court\nhas long explained, \u201cwe will . . . find an intent to preclude\nsuch review only if presented with clear and convincing ev-\nidence.\u201d Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43,\n64 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The presumption of judicial review is deeply rooted in our\nhistory and separation of powers.

Rossiter ed.\n1961) (emphasis deleted). In a government \u201cfounded on free\nprinciples,\u201d no one person, group, or branch may hold all\nthe keys of power over a private person\u2019s liberty or property.\nIbid. Instead, power must be set against power, \u201cdivided\nand balanced among several bodies . . . checked and re-\nstrained by the others.\u201d Ibid. As Chief Justice Marshall\nput it: \u201cIt would excite some surprise if, in a government of\nlaws and of principle . . . a department whose appropriate\nduty it is to decide questions of right, not only between in-\ndividuals, but between the government and individuals,\u201d a\nstatute might leave that individual \u201cwith no remedy, no ap-\npeal to the laws of his country, if he should believe the claim\nto be unjust.\u201d United States v. Nourse, 9 Pet. 8, 28\u201329\n(1835).\n  It should come as an equal surprise to think Congress\nmight have imposed an express limit on an executive bu-\nreaucracy\u2019s authority to decide the rights of individuals,\nand then entrusted that agency with the sole power to en-\nforce the limits of its own authority. Yet on Thryv\u2019s account,\n\u00a7315(b)\u2019s command that \u201cinter partes review may not be in-\nstituted\u201d would be left entrusted to the good faith of the very\nexecutive officials it is meant to constrain. (Emphasis\nadded.) We do not normally rush to a conclusion that Con-\ngress has issued such \u201c \u2018blank checks drawn to the credit of\nsome administrative officer.\u2019 \u201d Bowen v.

After all, the company submits, \u00a7315(b) is not really\na firm limit on the agency\u2019s authority, only a claim pro-\ncessing rule. For proof, the company reminds us that\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            13\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a7315(b) bars challengers who have already spent a year lit-\nigating in court from petitioning the agency, but leaves\nopen the possibility that the agency might still institute in-\nter partes review if a different, eligible petitioner happens\nto come along. And this theoretical possibility, Thryv tells\nus, suggests that the agency was meant to be allowed to act\nas it wants.\n   But Thryv\u2019s reply here is like saying Article III\u2019s \u201ccase or\ncontroversy\u201d requirement isn\u2019t really a limit on the power\nof federal courts, because it\u2019s always possible that some lit-\nigant with a live dispute will come forward and require the\ncourt to settle a particular legal question. The implacable\nfact is that nothing in the AIA gives the Director or the\nBoard freewheeling authority to conduct inter partes re-\nview. The statute demands the participation of a real party\nin interest, a petitioner who is not barred by prior litigation\nand who is willing to face estoppel should he lose. \u00a7\u00a7311(a),\n315. And if, as seems likely in our case and many others,\nno one is willing and able to meet those conditions, the law\ndoes not permit inter partes review. So rather than a claim\nprocessing rule, \u00a7315 is both a constraint on the agency\u2019s\npower and a valuable guarantee that a patent owner must\nbattle the same foe only once.\n   Realizing that its textual arguments are too strained to\ndemonstrate clearly and convincingly that Congress meant\nto displace judicial review, Thryv asks us to draw \u201cinfer-\nences\u201d from the AIA \u201cas a whole.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 16\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In particular, the com-\npany tells us that Congress\u2019s \u201coverriding purpose\u201d in creat-\ning inter partes review was to \u201cweed out poor quality pat-\nents,\u201d and that judicial enforcement of \u00a7315(b) would slow\nthis progress. Id., at 24 (quotation altered). But to support\nits thematic account of the law\u2019s goals, Thryv rests on one\nthin reed after another\u2014a House Report here, a floor state-\nment there, and a few quotations from Cuozzo Speed Tech-\nnologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), that summarize\n\f14    THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nthese same sources. All the rest is generously filled in by\nthe company\u2019s own account about how inter partes review\nought to work.\n  That\u2019s far from enough. The historic presumption of ju-\ndicial review has never before folded before a couple stray\npieces of legislative history and naked policy appeals. Be-\nsides, Thryv\u2019s submissions cannot withstand the mildest in-\nspection even on their own terms. No one doubts that Con-\ngress authorized inter partes review to encourage further\nscrutiny of already issued patents. But lost in Thryv\u2019s tell-\ning about the purposes of the AIA is plenty of evidence that\nCongress also included provisions to preserve the value of\npatents and protect the rights of patent owners. For exam-\nple, Congress sharply limited the legal grounds that might\nbe pursued in inter partes review, \u00a7311(b); afforded patent\nowners an opportunity to respond to petitions prior to insti-\ntution, \u00a7313; and, most relevant today, protected patent\nowners from the need to fight a two-front war before both\nthe Board and federal district court, \u00a7315. Legislating in-\nvolves compromise and it would be naive to think that, as\nthe price for their zealous new procedures for canceling pat-\nents, those who proposed the AIA didn\u2019t have to accept\nsome protections like these for patent holders. Yet, Thryv\nglides past all these provisions without comment. Worse,\ntaking the company\u2019s argument to its logical conclusion\ncould render these protections into \u201c \u2018merely advisory\u2019 \u201d fea-\ntures of the law. Bowen, 476 U. S., at 671. If adopted,\nThryv\u2019s vision of an administrative regime singularly fo-\ncused on the efficient canceling of patents could become\nself-fulfilling.\n  A case decided just weeks ago supplies a telling point of\ncomparison. In Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U. S. ___\n(2020), Congress sought to expedite the removal of aliens\nconvicted of certain aggravated felonies by foreclosing judi-\ncial review of their cases unless they raised \u201cquestions of\nlaw.\u201d See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71252(a)(2)(C), (D). But the statute\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Because the statute could be inter-\npreted either way, this Court held, the presumption of re-\nviewability preserved the aliens\u2019 ability to argue mixed\nquestions on appeal. Today, the textual arguments for\nshielding the agency\u2019s decision from review are even\nweaker, and the same presumption that preserved judicial\nreview for felons seeking discretionary relief from removal\nshould do no less work for patent holders seeking to defend\ntheir inventions.\n                               IV\n   Even if the statute\u2019s plain language and the presumption\nin favor of review dictate a ruling against it, Thryv finishes\nby suggesting we must ignore all that and rule for it anyway\nbecause precedent commands it. Maybe our precedent is\nwrong, the company says, but it binds us all the same.\n   In particular, Thryv points us to Cuozzo. There, the\nCourt suggested that \u00a7314(d) could preclude review in\ncases: (1) where a litigant challenges the Director\u2019s reason-\nable likelihood of success determination under \u00a7314(a), or\n(2) where a litigant \u201cgrounds its claim in a statute closely\nrelated to that decision to institute inter partes review.\u201d\n579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). That first path is faithful\nto the plain language of \u00a7314(d). The second appears no-\nwhere in the statute but is, instead, a product of the judicial\nimagination. Still, Thryv says, we must follow that path\nwherever it leads and, because \u00a7315(b) decisions are\n\u201cclosely related\u201d to \u00a7314(a) decisions, we shouldn\u2019t review\nthem.\n   But Cuozzo hardly held so much. In fact, Cuozzo had no\nneed to explore the second path it imagined, for it quickly\nconcluded that the argument before it was \u201clittle more than\na challenge to the Patent Office\u2019s conclusion under \u00a7314(a),\u201d\n\f16    THRYV, INC. v.

So all the dis-\ncussion about the reviewability of decisions outside \u00a7314(a)\nturned out to be nothing more than dicta entirely unneces-\nsary to the decision.

In SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___ (2018), an\ninter partes review petitioner challenged the Director\u2019s\npractice of instituting review of some, but not all, of the\nclaims challenged in a single petition. The government ar-\ngued there\u2014much as Thryv argues today\u2014that \u00a7314(d)\nshielded this unlawful practice from judicial review. In ad-\nvancing this argument, the government seized on the same\nlanguage in Cuozzo that Thryv now embraces, claiming\nthat its opponent\u2019s \u201cgrounds for attacking the decision . . .\nare closely tied\u201d to the \u00a7314(a) institution decision. Brief\nfor Federal Respondent in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, O. T.\n2017, No. 16\u2013969, p. 13. Because no one could say that the\npetitioner\u2019s argument in SAS Institute was \u201clittle more than\na challenge to the Patent Office\u2019s conclusion under \u00a7314(a),\u201d\n584 U.

S. ___ (2018).\nThere, a majority of this Court acquiesced to the AIA\u2019s pro-\nvisions allowing agency officials to withdraw already-issued\npatents subject to very limited judicial review. As the ma-\njority saw it, patents are merely another public franchise\nthat can be withdrawn more or less by executive grace. So\nwhat if patents were, for centuries, regarded as a form of\npersonal property that, like any other, could be taken only\nby a judgment of a court of law. So what if our separation\nof powers and history frown on unfettered executive power\nover individuals, their liberty, and their property. What the\ngovernment gives, the government may take away\u2014with or\nwithout the involvement of the independent Judiciary. To-\nday, a majority compounds that error by abandoning a good\npart of what little judicial review even the AIA left behind.\n   Just try to imagine this Court treating other individual\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            19\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nliberties or forms of private property this way. Major por-\ntions of this country were settled by homesteaders who\nmoved west on the promise of land patents from the federal\ngovernment. Much like an inventor seeking a patent for his\ninvention, settlers seeking these governmental grants had\nto satisfy a number of conditions. But once a patent issued,\nthe granted lands became the recipient\u2019s private property,\na vested right that could be withdrawn only in a court of\nlaw. No one thinks we would allow a bureaucracy in Wash-\nington to \u201ccancel\u201d a citizen\u2019s right to his farm, and do so de-\nspite the government\u2019s admission that it acted in violation\nof the very statute that gave it this supposed authority. For\nmost of this Nation\u2019s history it was thought an invention\npatent holder \u201cholds a property in his invention by as good\na title as the farmer holds his farm and flock.\u201d Hovey v.\nHenry, 12 F. Cas. 603, 604 (No. 6,742) (CC Mass. 1846)\n(Woodbury, J., for the court). Yet now inventors hold noth-\ning for long without executive grace. An issued patent be-\ncomes nothing more than a transfer slip from one agency\nwindow to another.\n   Some seek to dismiss this concern by noting that the bu-\nreaucracy the AIA empowers to revoke patents is the same\none that grants them. But what comfort is that when the\nConstitution promises an independent judge in any case in-\nvolving the deprivation of life, liberty, or property? Would\nit make things any better if we assigned the Department of\nthe Interior the task of canceling land patents because that\nagency initially allocated many of them? The relevant con-\nstitutional fact is not which agency granted a property\nright, but that a property right was granted.\n   The abdication of our judicial duty comes with a price.\nThe Director of the Patent and Trademark Office is a polit-\nical appointee. The AIA vests him with unreviewable au-\nthority to institute (or not) inter partes review. Nothing\nwould prevent him, it seems, from insulating his favorite\nfirms and industries from this process entirely. Those who\n\f20    THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nare not so fortunate proceed to an administrative \u201ctrial\u201d be-\nfore a panel of agency employees that the Director also has\nthe means to control. The AIA gives the Director the power\nto select which employees, and how many of them, will hear\nany particular inter partes challenge. It also gives him the\npower to decide how much they are paid. And if a panel\nreaches a result he doesn\u2019t like, the Director claims he may\norder rehearing before a new panel, of any size, and includ-\ning even himself.\n   No one can doubt that this regime favors those with po-\nlitical clout, the powerful and the popular. But what about\nthose who lack the resources or means to influence and\nmaybe even capture a politically guided agency? Consider\nMr. DuVal, who 25 years ago, came up with something the\nPatent Office agreed was novel and useful. His patent sur-\nvived not only that initial review but a subsequent admin-\nistrative ex parte review, a lawsuit, and the initiation of an-\nother. Yet, now, after the patent has expired, it is\nchallenged in still another administrative proceeding and\nretroactively expunged by an agency that has, by its own\nadmission, acted unlawfully. That is what happens when\npower is not balanced against power and executive action\ngoes unchecked by judicial review. Rather than securing\nincentives to invent, the regime creates incentives to curry\nfavor with officials in Washington.\n   Nor is it hard to imagine what might lie around the cor-\nner. Despite repeated lawsuits, no court ever ruled defini-\ntively on Mr. DuVal\u2019s patents. But suppose one had\u2014and\nsuppose he had prevailed. According to the agency, even\nthat judgment might not matter much. In other cases, the\nBoard has claimed the power through inter partes review\nto overrule final judicial judgments affirming patent rights.\nIn the Director\u2019s estimation, it appears, even this Court\u2019s\ndecisions must bow to the Board\u2019s will. See XY, LLC v.\nTrans Ova Genetics, L. C., 890 F. 3d 1282, 1285\u20131286,\n1294\u20131295 (CA Fed. 2018); Fresenius USA, Inc. v. Baxter\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

It\u2019s\nno wonder, then, that district courts sometimes throw up\ntheir hands and let the Board take over whenever inter\npartes review and patent litigation begin to overlap. Why\nbother with a trial if \u201cthe finality of any judgment rendered\nby [a] Court will be dubious\u201d? Order Granting Stay in\nClick-to-call Technologies LP v. Ingenio, Inc., No. 12\u2013cv\u2013\n00465 (WD Tex.), Doc. No. 147, p. 4.\n  It\u2019s understandable, too, why the agency might think so\nmuch is up for grabs. Not only did this Court give away\nmuch of its Article III authority in Oil States on a mistaken\nassessment that patents were historically treated as public\nfranchises rather than private rights. Some would have\nhad the Court go even further. Rather than looking to his-\ntory to determine how patents were treated, as both the ma-\njority and dissent sought to do, these Members of the Court\nsuggested that agencies should be allowed to withdraw\neven private rights if \u201ca number of factors\u201d\u2014taken to-\ngether, of course\u2014suggest it\u2019s a good idea. Commodity Fu-\ntures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 851 (1986);\nsee also Oil States, 584 U. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., concur-\nring) (slip op., at 1). These \u201cfactors\u201d turn out to include such\ndefinitive and easily balanced considerations as the \u201cnature\nof the claim,\u201d the \u201cnature of the non-Article III tribunal,\u201d\nand the \u201cnature and importance of the legislative purpose\nserved by the grant of adjudicatory authority to a tribunal\nwith judges who lack Article III\u2019s tenure and compensation\nprotections.\u201d Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. 462, 513 (2011)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting). In other words, Article III prom-\nises that a person\u2019s private rights may be taken only in pro-\nceedings before an independent judge, unless the govern-\nment\u2019s goals would be better served by a judge who isn\u2019t so\nindependent.\n  Thryv seeks to assure us that affected parties can still file\nwrits of mandamus in courts if the Patent Office gets really\n\f22    THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nout of hand. But the Court today will not say whether man-\ndamus is available where the \u00a7314(d) bar applies, and the\nFederal Circuit has cast doubt on that possibility. In re\nPower Integrations, Inc., 899 F. 3d 1316, 1319 (2018) (\u201cWe\nhave held that the statutory prohibition on appeals from\ndecisions not to institute inter partes review cannot be side-\nstepped simply by styling the request for review as a peti-\ntion for mandamus\u201d); In re Procter & Gamble Co., 749 F. 3d\n1376 (2014); In re Dominion Dealer Solutions, LLC., 749\nF. 3d 1379 (2014). Even assuming mandamus is available,\nit is a \u201cdrastic [remedy], to be invoked only in extraordinary\nsituations.\u201d Kerr v. United States Dist. Court for Northern\nDist. of Cal., 426 U. S. 394, 402 (1976). To be eligible for\nthis discretionary relief, a petitioner must first show a\n\u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right. Id., at 403 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). But how often could a litigant show\nsuch a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right in an area where\ncourts shirk their duty to say what the law is in the first\nplace? And how would a court find the will to call a situa-\ntion \u201cextraordinary\u201d once the agency has been free for so\nlong to ignore the limits on its power? If the case before us\ndoesn\u2019t qualify as \u201cextraordinary,\u201d and if the Board\u2019s admit-\nted flouting of \u00a7315(b) isn\u2019t \u201cclear and indisputable,\u201d then\nwhat extralegal act wouldn\u2019t be just another day at the\noffice?\n                              *\n   Two years ago, this Court sanctioned a departure from\nthe constitutional plan, one in which the Executive Branch\nassumed responsibilities long reserved to the Judiciary. In\nso doing, we denied inventors the right to have their claims\ntried before independent judges and juries.

Among other conditions set by statute, if a request comes more\n  than a year after suit against the requesting party for patent infringe-\n  ment, \u201c[a]n inter partes review may not be instituted.\u201d \u00a7315(b). The\n  agency\u2019s \u201cdetermination . . . whether to institute an inter partes review\n  under this section shall be final and nonappealable.\u201d \u00a7314(d).\n     Entities associated with petitioner Thryv, Inc. sought inter partes\n  review of a patent owned by respondent Click-to-Call Technologies,\n  LP. Click-to-Call countered that the petition was untimely under\n  \u00a7315(b). The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) disagreed and\n  instituted review. After proceedings on the merits, the Board issued a\n  final written decision reiterating its \u00a7315(b) decision and canceling 13\n  of the patent\u2019s claims as obvious or lacking novelty. Click-to-Call ap-\n  pealed the Board\u2019s \u00a7315(b) determination. Treating the Board\u2019s appli-\n  cation of \u00a7315(b) as judicially reviewable, the Court of Appeals con-\n  cluded that the petition was untimely, vacated the Board\u2019s decision,\n  and remanded with instructions to dismiss.\nHeld: Section 314(d) precludes judicial review of the agency\u2019s application\n of \u00a7315(b)\u2019s time prescription. Pp. 6\u201314.\n    (a) A party generally cannot contend on appeal that the agency\n should have refused \u201cto institute an inter partes review.\u201d \u00a7314(d).\n That follows from \u00a7314(d)\u2019s text and Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC\n v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___. In Cuozzo, this Court explained that \u00a7314(d)\n \u201cpreclud[es] review of the Patent Office\u2019s institution decisions\u201d\u2014at\n\f2        THRYV, INC. v.

Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) The question here is whether a challenge based on \u00a7315(b) ranks\n    as an appeal of the agency\u2019s decision \u201cto institute an inter partes re-\n    view.\u201d \u00a7314(d). There is no need to venture beyond Cuozzo\u2019s holding\n    that \u00a7314(d) bars review at least of matters \u201cclosely tied to the appli-\n    cation and interpretation of statutes related to\u201d the institution deci-\n    sion, 579 U. S., at ___. A \u00a7315(b) challenge easily meets that measure-\n    ment. Section 315(b), setting forth a circumstance in which \u201c[a]n inter\n    partes review may not be instituted,\u201d expressly governs institution and\n    nothing more. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (c) This conclusion is strongly reinforced by the statute\u2019s purpose\n    and design. Congress designed inter partes review to weed out bad\n    patent claims efficiently. Allowing \u00a7315(b) appeals, however, would\n    unwind agency proceedings determining patentability and leave bad\n    patents enforceable. Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (d) In Click-to-Call\u2019s view, \u00a7314(d)\u2019s bar on judicial review is limited\n    to the agency\u2019s threshold determination under \u00a7314(a) of the question\n    whether the petitioner has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing.\n    Cuozzo is fatal to that interpretation, for the Court in that case held\n    unreviewable the agency\u2019s application of a provision other than\n    \u00a7314(a). Contrary to Click-to-Call\u2019s contention, \u00a7314(d)\u2019s text does not\n    limit the review bar to \u00a7314(a). Rather than borrowing language from\n    related provisions that would have achieved Click-to-Call\u2019s preferred\n    meaning, Congress used broader language in \u00a7314(d). Click-to-Call\n    also insists that Congress intended judicial supervision of the agency\u2019s\n    application of \u00a7315(b), but the statute instead reflects a choice to en-\n    trust that issue to the agency. Finally, SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584\n    U. S. ___, offers Click-to-Call no assistance. Unlike the appeal held\n    reviewable in SAS Institute, Click-to-Call\u2019s appeal challenges not the\n    manner in which the agency\u2019s review proceeds once instituted, but\n    whether the agency should have instituted review at all. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (e) Click-to-Call argues in the alternative that its \u00a7315(b) objection\n    is authorized as an appeal from the Board\u2019s final written decision,\n    which addressed the \u00a7315(b) issue. Even labeled that way, Click-to-\n    Call\u2019s appeal is still barred by \u00a7314(d) because Click-to-Call\u2019s conten-\n    tion remains, essentially, that the agency should have refused to insti-\n    tute inter partes review.

Our answer is yes.

In 2013, petitioner Thryv sought\ninter partes review, challenging several of the patent\u2019s\nclaims.1\n   In opposition, Click-to-Call urged that \u00a7315(b) barred in-\nstitution of inter partes review because Thryv filed its peti-\ntion too late.

Section 315(b) did not bar the in-\nstitution of inter partes review, the Board concluded, be-\ncause a complaint dismissed without prejudice does not\ntrigger \u00a7315(b)\u2019s one-year limit. Finding no other barrier to\ninstitution, the Board decided to institute review. After\nproceedings on the merits, the Board issued a final written\ndecision reiterating its rejection of Click-to-Call\u2019s \u00a7315(b)\nargument and canceling 13 of the patent\u2019s claims as obvious\nor lacking novelty.\n   Click-to-Call appealed, challenging only the Board\u2019s de-\ntermination that \u00a7315(b) did not preclude inter partes re-\nview. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction, agreeing with Thryv and the Director (who in-\ntervened on appeal) that \u00a7314(d)\u2019s bar on appeal of the in-\nstitution decision precludes judicial review of the agency\u2019s\napplication of \u00a7315(b).

A successful \u00a7315(b)\nappeal would terminate in vacatur of the agency\u2019s decision;\nin lieu of enabling judicial review of patentability, vacatur\nwould unwind the agency\u2019s merits decision. See Cuozzo,\n579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). And because a patent owner\nwould need to appeal on \u00a7315(b) untimeliness grounds only\nif she could not prevail on patentability, \u00a7315(b) appeals\nwould operate to save bad patent claims. This case illus-\ntrates the dynamic. The agency held Click-to-Call\u2019s patent\nclaims invalid, and Click-to-Call does not contest that hold-\ning. It resists only the agency\u2019s institution decision, mind-\nful that if the institution decision is reversed, then the\nagency\u2019s work will be undone and the canceled patent\nclaims resurrected.\n   Other features of the statutory design confirm that Con-\ngress prioritized patentability over \u00a7315(b)\u2019s timeliness re-\nquirement. A petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \u00a7315(b) does not\nprevent the agency from conducting inter partes review of\nthe challenged patent claims; the agency can do so at an-\nother petitioner\u2019s request. \u00a7311(a).

In\nClick-to-Call\u2019s view, which the dissent embraces, post, at 6\u2013\n18, the bar on judicial review applies only to the agency\u2019s\nthreshold determination under \u00a7314(a) of the question\nwhether the petitioner has a reasonable likelihood of pre-\nvailing.

The\nprovision sweeps more broadly than the determination\nabout whether \u201cthere is a reasonable likelihood that the pe-\ntitioner would prevail.\u201d \u00a7314(a). Rather, it encompasses\nthe entire determination \u201cwhether to institute an inter\npartes review.\u201d \u00a7314(d).\n   And \u00a7314(d) refers not to a determination under subsec-\ntion (a), but to the determination \u201cunder this section.\u201d That\nphrase indicates that \u00a7314 governs the Director\u2019s institu-\ntion of inter partes review. Titled \u201cInstitution of inter\npartes review,\u201d \u00a7314 is the section housing the command to\nthe Director to \u201cdetermine whether to institute an inter\npartes review,\u201d \u00a7314(b). Thus, every decision to institute is\nmade \u201cunder\u201d \u00a7314 but must take account of specifications\nin other provisions\u2014such as the \u00a7312(a)(3) particularity re-\nquirement at issue in Cuozzo and the \u00a7315(b) timeliness re-\nquirement at issue here. Similar clarifying language recurs\nthroughout the AIA. See, e.g., \u00a7315(c) (referring to the Di-\nrector\u2019s determination regarding \u201cthe institution of an inter\npartes review under section 314\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7314(b)\n(referring to \u201ca petition filed under section 311,\u201d the section\nauthorizing the filing of petitions (emphasis added));\n\u00a7314(b)(1) (referring to \u201ca preliminary response to the peti-\ntion under section 313,\u201d the section authorizing the filing of\npreliminary responses to petitions (emphasis added)).\n   If Congress had intended Click-to-Call\u2019s meaning, it had\nat hand readymade language from a precursor to \u00a7314(d):\n\u201cA determination by the Director under subsection (a) shall\nbe final and non-appealable.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7312(c) (2006 ed.)\n(emphasis added) (governing inter partes reexamination).\nOr Congress might have borrowed from a related provision:\n\u201cA determination by the Director pursuant to subsection (a)\nof this section that no substantial new question of patenta-\nbility has been raised will be final and nonappealable.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7303(c) (emphasis added) (governing ex parte reex-\n\f12    THRYV, INC. v.

See post, at 15\u201318. The dissent does not consider itself bound\nby Cuozzo\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7314(d) bars appeal of \u201cquestions that are\nclosely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to\nthe Patent Office\u2019s decision to initiate inter partes review,\u201d 579 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 11). According to the dissent, that statement is dicta\nlater repudiated in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___ (2018).\n   But Cuozzo concerned an appeal resting on a \u201crelated statutory sec-\ntion\u201d: \u00a7312(a)(3). 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). That \u00a7312(a)(3)\nchallenge was tied to institution, the Court explained, for two reasons:\nfirst, because it \u201cattack[ed] a \u2018determination . . . whether to institute\u2019\nreview,\u201d id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138); second, because the \u00a7312(a)(3)\nchallenge was related to invoking \u00a7314(a)\u2019s condition on institution, id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12). Cuozzo\u2019s recognition that \u00a7314(d) can bar chal-\nlenges rooted in provisions other than \u00a7314(a) was hardly \u201cdicta,\u201d post,\nat 16\u2014it was the Court\u2019s holding. And SAS Institute purported to adhere\nto Cuozzo, not to overrule it. 584 U.

Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14).\n   We do not so lightly treat our determinations as dicta and our decisions\nas overruling others sub silentio. Nor can we countenance the dissent\u2019s\ndangerous insinuation that today\u2019s decision is not \u201creally\u201d binding prec-\nedent.

The\nBoard\u2019s final written decision addressed the \u00a7315(b) issue,\nso Click-to-Call argues that it may appeal under \u00a7319,\nwhich authorizes appeal from the final written decision.\nBut even labeled as an appeal from the final written deci-\nsion, Click-to-Call\u2019s attempt to overturn the Board\u2019s \u00a7315(b)\nruling is still barred by \u00a7314(d). Because \u00a7315(b)\u2019s sole of-\nfice is to govern institution, Click-to-Call\u2019s contention re-\nmains, essentially, that the agency should have refused to\ninstitute inter partes review. As explained, \u00a7314(d) makes\nthat contention unreviewable.\n                       *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and\nremand the case with instructions to dismiss for lack of ap-\npellate jurisdiction.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourts alike will just have to wait and see.\u201d). Lest any \u201cconfusion\u201d re-\nmain, post, at 17, we reaffirm today our holding in Cuozzo: Section 314(d)\ngenerally precludes appeals of the agency\u2019s institution decision, includ-\ning, beyond genuine debate, appeals \u201cconsist[ing] of questions that are\nclosely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to\u201d\nthe institution decision. 579 U.

Worse, the Court closes the court-\nhouse not in a case where the patent owner is merely un-\nhappy with the merits of the agency\u2019s decision but where\nthe owner claims the agency\u2019s proceedings were unlawful\nfrom the start. Most remarkably, the Court denies judicial\nreview even though the government now concedes that the\npatent owner is right and this entire exercise in property-\ntaking-by-bureaucracy was forbidden by law.\n  It might be one thing if Congress clearly ordained this\nstrange result. But it did not. The relevant statute, the\npresumption of judicial review, and our precedent all point\ntoward allowing, not forbidding, inventors their day in\ncourt. Yet, the Court brushes past these warning signs and,\nin the process, carries us another step down the road of ced-\ning core judicial powers to agency officials and leaving the\ndisposition of private rights and liberties to bureaucratic\nmercy.\n\f2     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n                                I\n   Our story stretches back to the 1990s, when Stephen Du-\nVal invented a system for anonymizing telephone calls. Be-\nlieving in the promise of his idea, Mr. DuVal hired an attor-\nney to secure a patent and sought avenues to bring his\ninvention to market. Initially, both efforts met with suc-\ncess. In 1998, Mr. DuVal was awarded a U. S. Patent,\nwhich he licensed to a company called InfoRocket.com, Inc.\n   But problems soon emerged. In 2001, InfoRocket accused\nIngenio, Inc., a predecessor of today\u2019s petitioner Thryv, Inc.,\nof infringing Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent. The case carried on in\nfederal district court for more than a year before InfoRocket\nand Ingenio decided to merge. The companies then jointly\npersuaded the court to dismiss InfoRocket\u2019s lawsuit without\nprejudice.\n   Still, the quiet did not last long. Following the merger,\nthe surviving entity\u2014for simplicity, call it Thryv\u2014sought\nto turn the tables on Mr. DuVal by asking the Patent Office\nto reconsider the validity of his patent in an ex parte reex-\namination. That agency-led process dragged on for four\nmore years, and ended with a mixed verdict: The Patent\nOffice canceled a few claims, but amended others and per-\nmitted Mr. DuVal to add some new ones too.\n   Even the ex parte reexamination wasn\u2019t enough to put\nthe parties\u2019 disputes to rest. During the reexamination,\nThryv terminated its license with Mr. DuVal and stopped\npaying him royalties. But it seems that Thryv continued\nusing the patented technology all the same. So Mr. Duval\ntransferred his patent to respondent Click-to-Call Technol-\nogies LP (CTC), which swiftly took the patent back to court.\nCTC noted that Thryv couldn\u2019t exactly plead ignorance\nabout this patent, given that the company or its predeces-\nsors had previously licensed the patent, been sued for in-\nfringing it, and asked the Patent Office to reexamine it.\nWhen it came to Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent, CTC alleged, Thryv\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

One year after CTC filed its federal lawsuit,\nThryv lodged another administrative petition with the Pat-\nent Office, this time seeking inter partes review. Echoing\nsome of the same arguments that led to its push for an\nex parte administrative reexamination nine years earlier,\nand adding other arguments too, Thryv (again) asked the\nagency to cancel Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent on the grounds that it\nlacked novelty and was obvious. At the same time, Thryv\nsought to stay proceedings in CTC\u2019s infringement suit.\nThryv argued that the district court should defer to the\nnewly initiated inter partes review. Like many district\ncourts facing the prospect of parallel administrative pro-\nceedings, this one obliged.\n   Why at this late hour did Thryv prefer to litigate before\nthe agency rather than a federal district court? The\nagency\u2019s ex parte reexamination years earlier hadn\u2019t helped\nThryv much. But since then, Congress had adopted the\nLeahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7100\net seq. That law created the inter partes review process,\nwhich provides a number of benefits to accused infringers\nsuch as Thryv. Like federal court litigation, inter partes\nreview holds the advantage of allowing a private party at-\ntacking a patent\u2019s validity to participate in adversarial pro-\nceedings, rather than rely on the agency to direct its own\ninvestigation as it does in ex parte reexamination.

Perhaps\nmost appealing, proceedings take place before the Patent\nTrial and Appeal Board, rather than in an Article III court,\nso there is no jury trial before a tenure-protected judge, only\na hearing before a panel of agency employees.\n   Some say the new regime represents a particularly\nefficient new way to \u201ckill\u201d patents. Certainly, the numbers\ntell an inviting story for petitioners like Thryv. In approx-\nimately 80% of cases reaching a final decision, the\nBoard cancels some or all of the challenged claims.\nPatent Trial and Appeal Board, Trial Statistics 10 (Feb.\n2020), https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/\nTrial_Statistics_2020_02_29.pdf.

So, while Congress sought to move many\ncases out of court and into its new administrative process,\nit thought patent owners who have already endured long\nchallenges in court shouldn\u2019t have to face another layer of\nadministrative review. After all, some repose is due inven-\ntors. Patents typically last 20 years; what happens to the\nincentive to invent if litigation over them lasts even longer\n(as it has for Mr. DuVal)? By anyone\u2019s estimation, too,\n\u00a7315(b)\u2019s time bar was sure to pose a special problem for\nThryv. Yes, Thryv had petitioned for inter partes review\none year after being served with CTC\u2019s complaint. But\nnearly 12 years had passed since Thryv\u2019s predecessor and\nprivy first found itself on the business end of a lawsuit al-\nleging that it had infringed Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent.\n   Despite this apparently fatal defect, the Board plowed\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            5\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nahead anyway. No one could dispute that Thryv\u2019s predeces-\nsor and privy had been \u201cserved with a complaint alleging\ninfringement of the patent\u201d more than a decade earlier. But\nthat complaint didn\u2019t count, the Board declared, because it\nwas dismissed without prejudice. The Board cited nothing\nin \u00a7315(b) suggesting this distinction makes a difference\nunder the statute\u2019s plain terms. Instead, the Board tiptoed\npast the problem and proceeded to invalidate almost all of\nthe patent claims before it, even those the Patent Office it-\nself had affirmed in its own ex parte proceeding years be-\nfore. No doubt this was exactly what Thryv hoped for in its\nsecond bite at the administrative apple.\n  Thryv\u2019s victory may have taken years to achieve, but it\ndidn\u2019t seem calculated to last long. Predictably, CTC ap-\npealed the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7315(b) to the Federal\nCircuit. And just as unsurprisingly, the court held that dis-\nmissed complaints do count as complaints, so Thryv\u2019s inter\npartes administrative challenge was time barred from the\nstart. Mr. DuVal\u2019s patent had already survived one\nex parte reexamination Thryv instigated. The patent had\nbeen the subject of long and repeated litigation in federal\ncourts. The agency had no business opening yet another\nnew inquiry into this very old patent.\n  But Thryv had one maneuver left. It sought review in\nthis Court, insisting that Article III courts lack authority\neven to say what the law demands. According to Thryv, a\ndifferent provision, \u00a7314(d), renders the agency\u2019s interpre-\ntations and applications of \u00a7315(b) immune from judicial re-\nview. So the Board can err; it can even act in defiance of\nplain congressional limits on its authority. But, in Thryv\u2019s\nview, a court can do nothing about it. Enforcement of\n\u00a7315(b)\u2019s time bar falls only to the very Patent Office offi-\ncials whose authority it seeks to restrain. Inventors like\nMr. DuVal just have to hope that the bureaucracy revoking\ntheir property rights will take the extra trouble of doing so\nin accordance with law.\n\f6     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\n  That\u2019s the strange place we now find ourselves. Thryv\nmanaged to persuade the Court to grant its petition for\ncertiorari to consider its extraordinary argument. And\ntoday the Court vindicates its last and most remarkable\nmaneuver.\n                              II\n                              A\n   How could \u00a7314(d) insulate from judicial review the\nagency\u2019s\u2014admittedly mistaken\u2014interpretation of an en-\ntirely different provision, \u00a7315(b)? The answer is that it\ndoesn\u2019t.\n   To see why, look no further than \u00a7314(d). The statute\ntells us that \u201c[t]he determination by the Director whether\nto institute an inter partes review under this section shall\nbe final and nonappealable.\u201d So the only thing \u00a7314(d) in-\nsulates from judicial review is \u201c[t]he determination\u201d made\n\u201cby the Director\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d\u2014that is, a determina-\ntion discussed within \u00a7314. Nothing in the statute insu-\nlates agency interpretations of other provisions outside\n\u00a7314, including those involving \u00a7315(b).\n   This arrangement makes sense. Given that \u00a7314(d)\nspeaks of \u201c[t]he\u201d determination by the Director \u201cunder this\nsection,\u201d it comes as no surprise that the section mentions\njust one such \u201cdetermination.\u201d It is found in \u00a7314(a), where\nthe Director \u201cdetermines\u201d whether the parties\u2019 initial plead-\nings suggest \u201ca reasonable likelihood\u201d the petitioner will\nprevail in defeating at least some aspect of the challenged\npatent. And it is easy to see why Congress might make a\npreliminary merits assessment like that exempt from fur-\nther view: If the Director institutes a meritless petition, the\nBoard can summarily affirm the patent\u2019s validity. See\n\u00a7318(a); 37 CFR \u00a7\u00a742.71\u201342.73. In any event, the Board is\nobligated to render a final\u2014and judicially reviewable\u2014de-\ncision within a year. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7\u00a7141(c), 316(a)(11),\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

So judicial review of the Director\u2019s initial ap-\npraisal of the merits isn\u2019t really eliminated as much as it is\nchanneled toward the Board\u2019s final decision on those mer-\nits. That process finds a ready analogue elsewhere in our\nlaw. Much as here, an indicted criminal defendant un-\nhappy with a grand jury\u2019s finding of probable cause isn\u2019t\npermitted to challenge that preliminary assessment, but\nmay instead move the court for acquittal after the govern-\nment has presented all its evidence. See Costello v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105355\"><a href=\"/opinion/105355/costello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (1956); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n29(a).\n   Matters outside \u00a7314 are different. Take the provision\nbefore us, \u00a7315(b). It promises that an inter partes review\n\u201cmay not be instituted\u201d more than a year after the initiation\nof litigation. This stands as an affirmative limit on the\nagency\u2019s authority. Much like a statute of limitations, this\nprovision supplies an argument a party can continue to\npress throughout the life of the administrative proceeding\nand on appeal. Nothing in \u00a7315(b) speaks of a \u201cdeter-\nmination by the Director,\u201d let alone suggests that the\nagency\u2019s initial ruling on a petition\u2019s timeliness is \u201cfinal and\nnonappealable.\u201d\n   To pretend otherwise would invite a linguistic nonsense.\nWe would have to read \u00a7314\u2019s language speaking of \u201c[t]he\u201d\n\u201cdetermination\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d to include not one de-\ntermination but two\u2014and to include not only the determi-\nnation actually made under \u201cthis section\u201d but also a second\nassessment made about the effect of an entirely different\nsection.\n   To pretend otherwise would invite a practical nonsense\nas well. Because the Director\u2019s initial \u201creasonable likeli-\nhood\u201d determination under \u00a7314(a) relates to the merits, it\nwill be effectively reviewed both by the Board and courts as\nthe case progresses. But when does the Director\u2019s applica-\ntion of \u00a7315(b)\u2019s time bar get another look? Under Thryv\u2019s\ninterpretation, a provision that reads like an affirmative\n\f8     THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nlimit on the agency\u2019s authority reduces to a mere sugges-\ntion. No matter how wrong or even purposefully evasive,\nthe Director\u2019s assessment of a petition\u2019s timeliness is al-\nways immune from review. And even that\u2019s not the end of\nit. In other cases, the Board has claimed it has the right to\nreview these initial timeliness decisions, and Thryv seems\ncontent with those rulings. See, e.g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Rob-\nert Bosch Healthcare Systems, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1382</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(CA Fed.\n2016). So it turns out the company doesn\u2019t really want to\nmake an initial administrative timeliness decisions final; it\njust wants to make them unreviewable in court, defying\nonce more \u00a7314\u2019s plain language and any rational explana-\ntion, except maybe as an expedient to win the day\u2019s case.\n                              B\n   Confronting so many problems in the statute\u2019s text,\nThryv seeks a way around them by offering a competing ac-\ncount of the law\u2019s operation. While \u00a7314 empowers the Di-\nrector to make an institution decision, Thryv asserts that\nvarious provisions scattered throughout the chapter\u2014such\nas \u00a7\u00a7314(a), 315(a)(1), and 315(b)\u2014help guide the decision.\nAnd on Thryv\u2019s interpretation, all questions related to the\nDirector\u2019s institution decision should be insulated from re-\nview, no matter where those rules are found. What about\nthe fact \u00a7314 speaks of insulating only \u201c[t]he\u201d \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d? Thryv says this language serves\nmerely to indicate which institution authority is unreview-\nable\u2014namely, the Director\u2019s authority to institute an inter\npartes proceeding pursuant to \u00a7314, rather than pursuant\nto some other provision.\n   This interpretation, however, makes a nullity of the very\nlanguage it purports to explain. Section 314 is the only sec-\ntion that authorizes the Director to institute inter partes\nreview, making it pointless for Congress to tell us that we\u2019re\ntalking about the Director\u2019s \u00a7314 inter partes review insti-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

In fact, you can strike \u201cunder\nthis section\u201d from \u00a7314(d) and Thryv\u2019s interpretation re-\nmains unchanged. That\u2019s a pretty good clue something has\ngone wrong.\n   Faced with this problem of surplusage, Thryv alludes to\nthe possibility that Congress included redundant language\nto be \u201cdouble sure.\u201d But double sure of what? Thryv does\nnot identify any confusion that the phrase \u201cunder this sec-\ntion\u201d might help avoid. Given the lack of any other provi-\nsion, anywhere in the U. S. Code, authorizing anyone to in-\nstitute inter partes review, even the most obtuse reader\nwould never have any use for the clarification supposedly\nprovided by \u201cunder this section\u201d on Thryv\u2019s account.\n   Maybe so, Thryv replies, but we shouldn\u2019t worry about\nthe surplusage here because the AIA contains surplusage\nelsewhere. The other putative examples of surplusage\nThryv identifies, however, have no bearing on the provision\nnow before us. And even a passing glance reveals no sur-\nplusage in them either. Consider \u00a7315(c). It says that \u201cthe\nDirector, in his or her discretion, may join as a party to that\ninter partes review any person who properly files a petition\nunder section 311 that the Director, after receiving a pre-\nliminary response under section 313 . . . , determines war-\nrants the institution of an inter partes review under section\n314.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thryv argues that all these cross-\nreferences are unnecessary. But look closely: Each of\n\u00a7315(c)\u2019s cross-references does important work to establish\nthe rules for joinder. Strike the first and the requirements\nof a joinder petition become undefined. Strike the second\nand it\u2019s a mystery what kind of response the patent owner\nis entitled to file. Strike the third and the Director\u2019s deter-\nmination whether to grant joinder becomes standardless.\nAll of this language has a point to it\u2014just as \u201cunder this\nsection\u201d does under a faithful interpretation of \u00a7314(d).\n   That leaves Thryv only one more tenuous textual lifeline\n\f10    THRYV, INC. v. CLICK-TO-CALL TECHNOLOGIES, LP\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nleft to toss. If Congress had wanted to insulate from review\nonly \u201c[t]he\u201d \u201cdetermination\u201d that a petition has a \u201creason-\nable likelihood\u201d of success, the company suggests, Congress\ncould have spoken of insulating \u201cthe determination under\nsubsection (a)\u201d rather than \u201cthe determination under this\nsection.\u201d And Thryv reminds us that Congress used that\nlatter formulation in nearby and predecessor statutes. See,\ne.g., \u00a7303(c) (\u201c[a] determination by the Director pursuant to\nsubsection (a) of this section . . . will be final and nonappeal-\nable\u201d); \u00a7312(c) (2006 ed.; repealed 2011) (\u201c[a] determination\nby the Director under subsection (a) shall be final and\nnon-appealable\u201d).\n   But so what? One could replace the phrase \u201cmy next-door\nneighbor to the west\u201d with \u201cmy neighbor at 123 Main\nStreet\u201d (assuming that is her address) and the meaning\nwould be the same. Likewise, it hardly matters whether\nCongress spoke of the \u201cdetermination\u201d \u201cunder this section\u201d\nor \u201cunder subsection (a).\u201d Either way, our attention is di-\nrected within, not beyond, \u00a7314. And what\u2019s Thryv\u2019s alter-\nnative? It would have us read language speaking of the Di-\nrector\u2019s determination \u201cunder this section\u201d to encompass\nany decision related to the initiation of inter partes review\nfound anywhere in the AIA\u2014an entire chapter of the U. S.\nCode. That\u2019s sort of like reading \u201cmy next-door neighbor to\nthe west\u201d to include \u201canyone in town.\u201d Nor do things get\nbetter for Thryv with a careful assessment of nearby and\npredecessor statutes. They reveal that Congress knew ex-\nactly how to give broader directions like the one Thryv ima-\ngines when it wished to do so. See, e.g., \u00a7314(b) (directing\nour attention to the Director\u2019s decision whether to institute\ninter partes review \u201cunder this chapter\u201d rather than \u201cunder\nthis section\u201d).\n   Without any plausible textual or contextual hook for its\nposition, Thryv finishes by advancing a parade of policy\nhorribles. It notes that the AIA imposes lots of other con-\nstraints on inter partes review besides the \u00a7315(b) timing\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nprovision now before us. For example, the law bars peti-\ntioners who have filed declaratory judgment actions from\nchallenging the same patent in inter partes review proceed-\nings, \u00a7315(a)(1), and it estops petitioners from seeking other\nforms of review once an inter partes proceeding finishes,\n\u00a7315(e). If courts are going to review the agency\u2019s applica-\ntion of \u00a7315(b), Thryv wonders, are they going to have to\nreview the agency\u2019s application of these other provisions\ntoo?\n   But we could just as easily march this parade in the op-\nposite direction. Even assuming (without deciding) that\nThryv is right and the reviewability of all these provisions\nstands or falls together, that seems at least as good an ar-\ngument for as against judicial review. If so much more is\nat stake, if many more kinds of agency errors could be insu-\nlated from correction, isn\u2019t that a greater reason to pay as-\nsiduous attention to the statute\u2019s terms? Surely, Thryv\u2019s\nprofessed concern for judicial economy supplies no license\nto ignore our duty to decide the cases properly put to us in\naccord with the statute\u2019s terms.\n                              III\n   This last point leads to another reason why we should re-\nject Thryv\u2019s reading of the statute. Even if the company\ncould muster some doubt about the reach of \u00a7314(d), it\nwouldn\u2019t be enough to overcome the \u201cwell-settled presump-\ntion favoring interpretations of statutes that allow judicial\nreview of administrative action.\u201d McNary v.

And this theoretical possibility, Thryv tells\nus, suggests that the agency was meant to be allowed to act\nas it wants.\n   But Thryv\u2019s reply here is like saying Article III\u2019s \u201ccase or\ncontroversy\u201d requirement isn\u2019t really a limit on the power\nof federal courts, because it\u2019s always possible that some lit-\nigant with a live dispute will come forward and require the\ncourt to settle a particular legal question. The implacable\nfact is that nothing in the AIA gives the Director or the\nBoard freewheeling authority to conduct inter partes re-\nview. The statute demands the participation of a real party\nin interest, a petitioner who is not barred by prior litigation\nand who is willing to face estoppel should he lose. \u00a7\u00a7311(a),\n315. And if, as seems likely in our case and many others,\nno one is willing and able to meet those conditions, the law\ndoes not permit inter partes review. So rather than a claim\nprocessing rule, \u00a7315 is both a constraint on the agency\u2019s\npower and a valuable guarantee that a patent owner must\nbattle the same foe only once.\n   Realizing that its textual arguments are too strained to\ndemonstrate clearly and convincingly that Congress meant\nto displace judicial review, Thryv asks us to draw \u201cinfer-\nences\u201d from the AIA \u201cas a whole.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 16\n(internal quotation marks omitted).

All the rest is generously filled in by\nthe company\u2019s own account about how inter partes review\nought to work.\n  That\u2019s far from enough. The historic presumption of ju-\ndicial review has never before folded before a couple stray\npieces of legislative history and naked policy appeals. Be-\nsides, Thryv\u2019s submissions cannot withstand the mildest in-\nspection even on their own terms. No one doubts that Con-\ngress authorized inter partes review to encourage further\nscrutiny of already issued patents. But lost in Thryv\u2019s tell-\ning about the purposes of the AIA is plenty of evidence that\nCongress also included provisions to preserve the value of\npatents and protect the rights of patent owners. For exam-\nple, Congress sharply limited the legal grounds that might\nbe pursued in inter partes review, \u00a7311(b); afforded patent\nowners an opportunity to respond to petitions prior to insti-\ntution, \u00a7313; and, most relevant today, protected patent\nowners from the need to fight a two-front war before both\nthe Board and federal district court, \u00a7315. Legislating in-\nvolves compromise and it would be naive to think that, as\nthe price for their zealous new procedures for canceling pat-\nents, those who proposed the AIA didn\u2019t have to accept\nsome protections like these for patent holders. Yet, Thryv\nglides past all these provisions without comment. Worse,\ntaking the company\u2019s argument to its logical conclusion\ncould render these protections into \u201c \u2018merely advisory\u2019 \u201d fea-\ntures of the law. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111686\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bowen,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111686/bowen-v-michigan-academy-of-family-physicians/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Because the statute could be inter-\npreted either way, this Court held, the presumption of re-\nviewability preserved the aliens\u2019 ability to argue mixed\nquestions on appeal. Today, the textual arguments for\nshielding the agency\u2019s decision from review are even\nweaker, and the same presumption that preserved judicial\nreview for felons seeking discretionary relief from removal\nshould do no less work for patent holders seeking to defend\ntheir inventions.\n                               IV\n   Even if the statute\u2019s plain language and the presumption\nin favor of review dictate a ruling against it, Thryv finishes\nby suggesting we must ignore all that and rule for it anyway\nbecause precedent commands it. Maybe our precedent is\nwrong, the company says, but it binds us all the same.\n   In particular, Thryv points us to Cuozzo. There, the\nCourt suggested that \u00a7314(d) could preclude review in\ncases: (1) where a litigant challenges the Director\u2019s reason-\nable likelihood of success determination under \u00a7314(a), or\n(2) where a litigant \u201cgrounds its claim in a statute closely\nrelated to that decision to institute inter partes review.\u201d\n579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). That first path is faithful\nto the plain language of \u00a7314(d). The second appears no-\nwhere in the statute but is, instead, a product of the judicial\nimagination. Still, Thryv says, we must follow that path\nwherever it leads and, because \u00a7315(b) decisions are\n\u201cclosely related\u201d to \u00a7314(a) decisions, we shouldn\u2019t review\nthem.\n   But Cuozzo hardly held so much. In fact, Cuozzo had no\nneed to explore the second path it imagined, for it quickly\nconcluded that the argument before it was \u201clittle more than\na challenge to the Patent Office\u2019s conclusion under \u00a7314(a),\u201d\n\f16    THRYV, INC. v.

So all the dis-\ncussion about the reviewability of decisions outside \u00a7314(a)\nturned out to be nothing more than dicta entirely unneces-\nsary to the decision. Nor did anything in Cuozzo directly\naddress \u00a7315(b) decisions, let alone declare them to\nbe \u201cclose enough\u201d to \u00a7314(a) decisions to preclude judicial\nreview.\n   That\u2019s just the beginning of Thryv\u2019s precedent problems,\ntoo. In SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___ (2018), an\ninter partes review petitioner challenged the Director\u2019s\npractice of instituting review of some, but not all, of the\nclaims challenged in a single petition. The government ar-\ngued there\u2014much as Thryv argues today\u2014that \u00a7314(d)\nshielded this unlawful practice from judicial review. In ad-\nvancing this argument, the government seized on the same\nlanguage in Cuozzo that Thryv now embraces, claiming\nthat its opponent\u2019s \u201cgrounds for attacking the decision . . .\nare closely tied\u201d to the \u00a7314(a) institution decision. Brief\nfor Federal Respondent in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, O. T.\n2017, No. 16\u2013969, p. 13. Because no one could say that the\npetitioner\u2019s argument in SAS Institute was \u201clittle more than\na challenge to the Patent Office\u2019s conclusion under \u00a7314(a),\u201d\n584 U.

Greene\u2019s Energy Group, LLC, 584 U. S. ___ (2018).\nThere, a majority of this Court acquiesced to the AIA\u2019s pro-\nvisions allowing agency officials to withdraw already-issued\npatents subject to very limited judicial review. As the ma-\njority saw it, patents are merely another public franchise\nthat can be withdrawn more or less by executive grace. So\nwhat if patents were, for centuries, regarded as a form of\npersonal property that, like any other, could be taken only\nby a judgment of a court of law. So what if our separation\nof powers and history frown on unfettered executive power\nover individuals, their liberty, and their property. What the\ngovernment gives, the government may take away\u2014with or\nwithout the involvement of the independent Judiciary. To-\nday, a majority compounds that error by abandoning a good\npart of what little judicial review even the AIA left behind.\n   Just try to imagine this Court treating other individual\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Major por-\ntions of this country were settled by homesteaders who\nmoved west on the promise of land patents from the federal\ngovernment. Much like an inventor seeking a patent for his\ninvention, settlers seeking these governmental grants had\nto satisfy a number of conditions. But once a patent issued,\nthe granted lands became the recipient\u2019s private property,\na vested right that could be withdrawn only in a court of\nlaw. No one thinks we would allow a bureaucracy in Wash-\nington to \u201ccancel\u201d a citizen\u2019s right to his farm, and do so de-\nspite the government\u2019s admission that it acted in violation\nof the very statute that gave it this supposed authority. For\nmost of this Nation\u2019s history it was thought an invention\npatent holder \u201cholds a property in his invention by as good\na title as the farmer holds his farm and flock.\u201d Hovey v.\nHenry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Yet now inventors hold noth-\ning for long without executive grace. An issued patent be-\ncomes nothing more than a transfer slip from one agency\nwindow to another.\n   Some seek to dismiss this concern by noting that the bu-\nreaucracy the AIA empowers to revoke patents is the same\none that grants them. But what comfort is that when the\nConstitution promises an independent judge in any case in-\nvolving the deprivation of life, liberty, or property? Would\nit make things any better if we assigned the Department of\nthe Interior the task of canceling land patents because that\nagency initially allocated many of them? The relevant con-\nstitutional fact is not which agency granted a property\nright, but that a property right was granted.\n   The abdication of our judicial duty comes with a price.\nThe Director of the Patent and Trademark Office is a polit-\nical appointee. The AIA vests him with unreviewable au-\nthority to institute (or not) inter partes review. Nothing\nwould prevent him, it seems, from insulating his favorite\nfirms and industries from this process entirely. Those who\n\f20    THRYV, INC. v.

The AIA gives the Director the power\nto select which employees, and how many of them, will hear\nany particular inter partes challenge. It also gives him the\npower to decide how much they are paid. And if a panel\nreaches a result he doesn\u2019t like, the Director claims he may\norder rehearing before a new panel, of any size, and includ-\ning even himself.\n   No one can doubt that this regime favors those with po-\nlitical clout, the powerful and the popular. But what about\nthose who lack the resources or means to influence and\nmaybe even capture a politically guided agency? Consider\nMr. DuVal, who 25 years ago, came up with something the\nPatent Office agreed was novel and useful. His patent sur-\nvived not only that initial review but a subsequent admin-\nistrative ex parte review, a lawsuit, and the initiation of an-\nother. Yet, now, after the patent has expired, it is\nchallenged in still another administrative proceeding and\nretroactively expunged by an agency that has, by its own\nadmission, acted unlawfully. That is what happens when\npower is not balanced against power and executive action\ngoes unchecked by judicial review. Rather than securing\nincentives to invent, the regime creates incentives to curry\nfavor with officials in Washington.\n   Nor is it hard to imagine what might lie around the cor-\nner. Despite repeated lawsuits, no court ever ruled defini-\ntively on Mr. DuVal\u2019s patents. But suppose one had\u2014and\nsuppose he had prevailed. According to the agency, even\nthat judgment might not matter much. In other cases, the\nBoard has claimed the power through inter partes review\nto overrule final judicial judgments affirming patent rights.\nIn the Director\u2019s estimation, it appears, even this Court\u2019s\ndecisions must bow to the Board\u2019s will.

Argued November 4, 2019\u2014Decided April 23, 2020\nWhen a lawful permanent resident commits certain serious crimes, the\n Government may initiate removal proceedings before an immigration\n judge. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a. If the lawful permanent resident is found\n removable, the immigration judge may cancel removal, but only if the\n lawful permanent resident meets strict statutory eligibility require-\n ments. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), 1229b(d)(1)(B).\n    Over the span of 12 years, lawful permanent resident Andre Barton\n was convicted of state crimes, including a firearms offense, drug of-\n fenses, and aggravated assault offenses. An Immigration Judge found\n him removable based on his state firearms and drug offenses. Barton\n applied for cancellation of removal. Among the eligibility require-\n ments, a lawful permanent resident must have \u201cresided in the United\n States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any sta-\n tus.\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(2). Another provision, the so-called stop-time rule,\n provides that a continuous period of residence \u201cshall be deemed to end\u201d\n when the lawful permanent resident commits \u201can offense referred to\n in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible to the\n United States under section 1182(a)(2).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). Because\n Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were committed within his first\n seven years of admission and were covered by \u00a71182(a)(2), the Immi-\n gration Judge concluded that Barton was not eligible for cancellation\n of removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals and the Eleventh Cir-\n cuit agreed.\nHeld: For purposes of cancellation-of-removal eligibility, a \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\n fense committed during the initial seven years of residence does not\n need to be one of the offenses of removal. Pp. 6\u201317.\n    (a) The cancellation-of-removal statute functions like a traditional\n\f2                            BARTON v. BARR\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    recidivist sentencing statute, making a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes rele-\n    vant to eligibility for cancellation of removal. The statute\u2019s text clari-\n    fies two points relevant here. First, cancellation of removal is pre-\n    cluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the noncitizen\n    \u201ccommitted an offense referred to in section 1182(a)(2),\u201d even if (as in\n    Barton\u2019s case) the conviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\n    Second, the offense must \u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible\u201d as a result.\n    For crimes involving moral turpitude, the relevant category here,\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) provides that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when\n    he is convicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n       As a matter of statutory text and structure, the analysis here is\n    straightforward. Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were crimes in-\n    volving moral turpitude and therefore \u201creferred to in section\n    1182(a)(2).\u201d He committed the offenses during his initial seven years\n    of residence and was later convicted of the offenses, thereby rendering\n    him \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Barton was, therefore, ineligible for cancellation\n    of removal. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Barton\u2019s counterarguments are unpersuasive. First, he claims\n    that the statute\u2019s structure supports an \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach.\n    But \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014are ordinarily the\n    basis for removal of lawful permanent residents. Therefore, Barton\u2019s\n    structural argument falls apart. If he were correct, the statute pre-\n    sumably would specify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or sec-\n    tion 1227(a)(2).\u201d By contrast, some other immigration law provisions\n    do focus only on the offense of removal, and their statutory text and\n    context support that limitation.          See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71226(a), (c)(1)(A),\n    1252(a)(2)(C).\n       Second, seizing on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an offense re-\n    ferred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible\n    to the United States under section 1182(a)(2),\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B), Barton\n    argues that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when actually ad-\n    judicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the United States,\n    something that usually cannot happen to a lawfully admitted nonciti-\n    zen. But the statutory text employs the term \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a\n    status that can result from, e.g., a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully\n    admitted noncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n    \u00a71182(a)(2). See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (B). And Congress has made\n    that status relevant in several statutory contexts that apply to law-\n    fully admitted noncitizens such as Barton. In those contexts, a noncit-\n    izen faces immigration consequences from being convicted of a\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even though the noncitizen is lawfully admitted\n    and is not necessarily removable solely because of that offense. See,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii). Such examples pose a major hurdle\n    for Barton\u2019s textual argument, and Barton has no persuasive answer.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     Third, Barton argues that the Government\u2019s interpretation treats as\n  surplusage the phrase \u201cor removable from the United States under\n  section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4).\u201d But redundancies are common in\n  statutory drafting. The Court has often recognized that sometimes the\n  better overall reading of a statute contains some redundancy. And re-\n  dundancy in one portion of a statute is not a license to rewrite or evis-\n  cerate another portion of the statute contrary to its text.\n     Finally, Barton argues alternatively that, even if inadmissibility is\n  a status, and even if the offense that precludes cancellation of removal\n  need not be one of the offenses of removal, a noncitizen must at least\n  have been capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmissibility\n  offense as the basis for removal. Because the cancellation-of-removal\n  statute is a recidivist statute, however, whether the offense that pre-\n  cludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have been charged\n  as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant.

BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                  [April 23, 2020]\n\n   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Under the immigration laws, a noncitizen who is author-\nized to live permanently in the United States is a lawful\npermanent resident\u2014also commonly known as a green-\ncard holder. But unlike a U. S. citizen, a lawful permanent\nresident who commits a serious crime may be removed from\nthe United States.\n   Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a longtime law-\nful permanent resident of the United States. During his\ntime in the United States, Barton has been convicted of\nstate crimes on three separate occasions spanning 12 years.\nThe crimes include a firearms offense, drug offenses, and\naggravated assault offenses. By law, the firearms offense\nand the drug offenses each independently rendered Barton\neligible for removal from the United States. In September\n2016, the U. S. Government sought to remove Barton,\nand a U. S. Immigration Judge determined that Barton was\nremovable.\n   Barton applied for cancellation of removal, a form of relief\nthat allows a noncitizen to remain in the United States de-\n\f2                         BARTON v. BARR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nspite being found removable. The immigration laws author-\nize an immigration judge to cancel removal, but Congress\nhas established strict eligibility requirements. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), (d)(1)(B). For a lawful permanent res-\nident such as Barton, the applicant for cancellation of re-\nmoval (1) must have been a lawful permanent resident for\nat least five years; (2) must have continuously resided in\nthe United States for at least seven years after lawful ad-\nmission; (3) must not have been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony as defined in the immigration laws; and (4) during\nthe initial seven years of continuous residence, must not\nhave committed certain other offenses listed in 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71182(a)(2). If a lawful permanent resident meets those el-\nigibility requirements, the immigration judge has discre-\ntion to (but is not required to) cancel removal and allow the\nlawful permanent resident to remain in the United States.\n   Under the cancellation-of-removal statute, the immigra-\ntion judge examines the applicant\u2019s prior crimes, as well as\nthe offense that triggered his removal. If a lawful perma-\nnent resident has ever been convicted of an aggravated fel-\nony, or has committed an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) dur-\ning the initial seven years of residence, that criminal record\nwill preclude cancellation of removal.1 In that way, the\nstatute operates like traditional criminal recidivist laws,\nwhich ordinarily authorize or impose greater sanctions on\noffenders who have committed prior crimes.\n   In this case, after finding Barton removable based on his\nstate firearms and drug offenses, the Immigration Judge\nand the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) concluded that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As the statute makes clear, and as we discuss below, committing a\n\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense precludes cancellation of removal only if the offense\nalso \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen inadmissible. See infra, at 10. Section\n1182(a)(2) specifies what that means for each of its enumerated offenses.\nFor the offense at issue in this case, the noncitizen must also have been\nconvicted of or admitted the offense.\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nBarton was not eligible for cancellation of removal. Barton\nhad committed offenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during his ini-\ntial seven years of residence\u2014namely, his state aggravated\nassault offenses in 1996. Barton\u2019s 1996 aggravated assault\noffenses were not the offenses that triggered his removal.\nBut according to the BIA, and contrary to Barton\u2019s argu-\nment, the offense that precludes cancellation of removal\nneed not be one of the offenses of removal. In re Jurado-\nDelgado, 24 I. & N. Dec. 29, 31 (BIA 2006). The U. S. Court\nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the BIA\u2019s\nreading of the statute and concluded that Barton was not\neligible for cancellation of removal. The Second, Third, and\nFifth Circuits have similarly construed the statute; only the\nNinth Circuit has disagreed.\n   Barton argues that the BIA and the Eleventh Circuit mis-\ninterpreted the statute. He contends that the \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffense that precludes cancellation of removal must be one\nof the offenses of removal. We disagree with Barton, and\nwe affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.\n                             I\n  Federal immigration law governs the admission of\nnoncitizens to the United States and the deportation of\nnoncitizens previously admitted. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71182(a),\n1227(a), 1229a.2 The umbrella statutory term for being\ninadmissible or deportable is \u201cremovable.\u201d \u00a71229a(e)(2).\n  A noncitizen who is authorized to live permanently in the\nUnited States is a lawful permanent resident, often known\nas a green-card holder. When a lawful permanent resident\ncommits a crime and is determined by an immigration\njudge to be removable because of that crime, the Attorney\nGeneral (usually acting through an immigration judge) may\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This opinion uses the term \u201cnoncitizen\u201d as equivalent to the statutory\n\nterm \u201calien.\u201d See 8 U.

But the comprehensive immi-\ngration law that Congress passed and President Clinton\nsigned in 1996 tightly cabins eligibility for cancellation of\nremoval. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013546, 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71101 note.\n   For a lawful permanent resident, the cancellation-of-\nremoval statute provides that an immigration judge \u201cmay\ncancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible\nor deportable from the United States if the alien\u2014(1) has\nbeen an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for\nnot less than 5 years, (2) has resided in the United States\ncontinuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any\nstatus, and (3) has not been convicted of any aggravated fel-\nony.\u201d \u00a71229b(a).3\n   The statute imposes one other requirement known as the\n\u201cstop-time rule.\u201d As relevant here, the statute provides that\na lawful permanent resident, during the initial seven years\nof residence, also cannot have committed \u201can offense re-\nferred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2) of this title or removable from the United States\nunder section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(d)(1)(B).\n   Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a lawful per-\nmanent resident of the United States. In 1996, he was con-\nvicted in a Georgia court of a firearms offense stemming\nfrom an incident where Barton and a friend shot up the\nhouse of Barton\u2019s ex-girlfriend. In separate proceedings in\n2007 and 2008, he was convicted in Georgia courts of state\ndrug offenses. One case involved methamphetamine, and\nthe other involved cocaine and marijuana.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The immigration laws impose a similar but even stricter set of eligi-\n\nbility requirements for noncitizens who are not lawful permanent resi-\ndents. \u00a71229b(b).\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

C. \u00a71227(a)(2) based on the 1996\nfirearms offense and the 2007 and 2008 drug crimes. See\n\u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i), (C). Barton conceded that he was remov-\nable based on his criminal convictions for the firearms of-\nfense and drug offenses, and an Immigration Judge found\nhim removable.\n   Barton applied for cancellation of removal. All agree that\nBarton meets two of the eligibility requirements for cancel-\nlation of removal. He has been a lawful permanent resident\nfor more than five years. And he has not been convicted of\nan \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined by the immigration laws.\n   The Immigration Judge concluded, however, that Barton\nhad committed an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during his\ninitial seven years of residence. In 1996, 61\u20442 years after his\nadmission to this country, Barton committed aggravated\nassault offenses for which he was later convicted in a Geor-\ngia court. The Immigration Judge concluded that those ag-\ngravated assault offenses were covered by \u00a71182(a)(2) and\nthat Barton was therefore not eligible for cancellation of\nremoval.\n   The Board of Immigration Appeals and the U. S. Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit likewise concluded that\nBarton was not eligible for cancellation of removal. Barton\nv. United States Atty. Gen., 904 F. 3d 1294, 1302 (2018).\nThe key question was whether the offense that precludes\ncancellation of removal (here, Barton\u2019s 1996 aggravated\nassault offenses) must also be one of the offenses of\nremoval.4 The Board of Immigration Appeals has long\ninterpreted the statute to mean that \u201can alien need not\nactually be charged and found inadmissible or removable\non the applicable ground in order for the criminal conduct\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The term \u201coffense of removal\u201d describes the offense that was the\n\nground on which the immigration judge, at the removal proceeding,\nfound the noncitizen removable.\n\f6                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin question to terminate continuous residence in this\ncountry\u201d and preclude cancellation of removal. Jurado-\nDelgado, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 31. In this case, the Eleventh\nCircuit likewise indicated that the \u00a71182(a)(2) offense that\nprecludes cancellation of removal need not be one of the\noffenses of removal. 904 F. 3d, at 1299\u20131300. And the\nSecond, Third, and Fifth Circuits have similarly construed\nthe statute. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 F. 3d 60, 68 (CA2\n2017); Ardon v. Attorney General of United States, 449 Fed.\nAppx. 116, 118 (CA3 2011); Calix v. Lynch, 784 F. 3d 1000,\n1011 (CA5 2015).\n   But in 2018, the Ninth Circuit disagreed with those\ncourts and with the BIA. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a\nlawful permanent resident\u2019s commission of an offense listed\nin \u00a71182(a)(2) makes the noncitizen ineligible for\ncancellation of removal only if that offense was one of the\noffenses of removal. Nguyen v. Sessions, 901 F. 3d 1093,\n1097 (2018). Under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach, Barton\nwould have been eligible for cancellation of removal because\nhis \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses (his 1996 aggravated assault\noffenses) were not among the offenses of removal (his 1996\nfirearms offense and his 2007 and 2008 drug crimes).\n   In light of the division in the Courts of Appeals over how\nto interpret this statute, we granted certiorari. 587 U.

Government may seek to\nremove that noncitizen by initiating removal proceedings\nbefore an immigration judge.

But the\nimmigration laws impose strict eligibility requirements for\ncancellation of removal. To reiterate, a lawful permanent\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

The statutory list of aggravated felo-\nnies is long: murder, rape, drug trafficking, firearms traf-\nficking, obstruction of justice, treason, gambling, human\ntrafficking, and tax evasion, among many other crimes.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(A)\u2013(U).\n   In addition, the law precludes cancellation of removal if\nthe lawful permanent resident committed certain other se-\nrious crimes during the initial seven years of residence. The\nlaw defines those offenses by cross-referencing \u00a71182(a)(2),\nwhich specifies the offenses that can render a noncitizen\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d to the United States. Section 1182(a)(2) in-\ncludes \u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude,\u201d which is a gen-\neral category that covers a wide variety of crimes. Section\n1182(a)(2) also expressly encompasses various violations of\ndrug laws, prostitution, money laundering, and certain\nDUIs involving personal injury, among other crimes.\n\f8                          BARTON v. BARR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (C), (D), (E), (I); see \u00a71101(h).\n   In specifying when cancellation of removal would be pre-\ncluded because of prior criminal activity, Congress struck a\nbalance that considers both the nature of the prior crime\nand the length of time that the noncitizen has resided in the\nUnited States. If a lawful permanent resident has been\nconvicted at any time of certain crimes (what the immigra-\ntion laws refer to as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d), then the\nnoncitizen is not eligible for cancellation of removal. If dur-\ning the initial 7-year period of residence, a lawful perma-\nnent resident committed certain other offenses referred to\nin \u00a71182(a)(2), then the noncitizen likewise is not eligible\nfor cancellation of removal.\n   In providing that a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes (in addition\nto the offense of removal) can render him ineligible for can-\ncellation of removal, the cancellation-of-removal statute\nfunctions like a traditional recidivist sentencing statute. In\nan ordinary criminal case, a defendant may be convicted of\na particular criminal offense. And at sentencing, the de-\nfendant\u2019s other criminal offenses may be relevant. So too\nin the immigration removal context. A noncitizen may be\nfound removable based on a certain criminal offense. In ap-\nplying for cancellation of removal, the noncitizen must de-\ntail his entire criminal record on Form EOIR\u201342A. An im-\nmigration judge then must determine whether the\nnoncitizen has been convicted of an aggravated felony at\nany time or has committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the\ninitial seven years of residence. It is entirely ordinary to\nlook beyond the offense of conviction at criminal sentencing,\nand it is likewise entirely ordinary to look beyond the of-\nfense of removal at the cancellation-of-removal stage in im-\nmigration cases.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 If the offense of removal itself was an aggravated felony or was an\n\noffense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) that was committed during the initial seven\nyears of residence, then the offense of removal alone precludes cancella-\ntion of removal, regardless of whether the noncitizen has an additional\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)        9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   It is not surprising, moreover, that Congress required im-\nmigration judges considering cancellation of removal to\nlook in part at whether the noncitizen has committed any\noffenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2). The offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) help determine whether a noncitizen should be\nadmitted to the United States. Under the cancellation-of-\nremoval statute, immigration judges must look at that\nsame category of offenses to determine whether, after a pre-\nviously admitted noncitizen has been determined to be de-\nportable, the noncitizen should nonetheless be allowed to\nremain in the United States. If a crime is serious enough\nto deny admission to a noncitizen, the crime can also be se-\nrious enough to preclude cancellation of removal, at least if\ncommitted during the initial seven years of residence.\n   Importantly, the text of the cancellation-of-removal stat-\nute does not simply say that cancellation of removal is pre-\ncluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the\nnoncitizen was convicted of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). Rather, the text says that cancellation of re-\nmoval is precluded when, during the initial seven years of\nresidence, the noncitizen \u201ccommitted an offense referred to\nin section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissi-\nble.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). That language clarifies two points of\nrelevance here.\n   First, cancellation of removal is precluded if a noncitizen\ncommitted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven\nyears of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the convic-\ntion occurred after the seven years elapsed. In other words,\nas Congress specified in the statute and as the BIA and the\nCourts of Appeals have recognized, the date of commission\nof the offense is the key date for purposes of calculating\nwhether the noncitizen committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense\nduring the initial seven years of residence. See In re Perez,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrecord of prior crimes.\n\f10                    BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n22 I. & N. Dec. 689, 693\u2013694 (BIA 1999) (date of commis-\nsion is controlling date); see also Heredia, 865 F. 3d, at 70\u2013\n71 (\u201cthe date of the commission of the offense governs the\ncomputation of a lawful permanent resident\u2019s continuous\nresidency in the United States\u201d); Calix, 784 F. 3d, at 1012\n(\u201cOnce he was convicted of the offense\u201d referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2), \u201che was rendered inadmissible to the United\nStates. His accrual of continuous residence was halted as\nof the date he committed that offense\u201d).\n   Second, the text of the law requires that the noncitizen\nbe rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d as a result of the offense. For\ncrimes involving moral turpitude, which is the relevant cat-\negory of \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses here, \u00a71182(a)(2) provides that\na noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when he is con-\nvicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). As the\nEleventh Circuit explained, \u201cwhile only commission is re-\nquired at step one, conviction (or admission) is required at\nstep two.\u201d 904 F. 3d, at 1301.\n   In this case, Barton\u2019s 1996 state aggravated assault of-\nfenses were crimes involving moral turpitude and therefore\n\u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2).\u201d Barton committed those\noffenses during his initial seven years of residence. He was\nlater convicted of the offenses in a Georgia court and\nthereby rendered \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Therefore, Barton was in-\neligible for cancellation of removal.\n   As a matter of statutory text and structure, that analysis\nis straightforward. The Board of Immigration Appeals has\nlong interpreted the statute that way. See Jurado-Delgado,\n24 I. & N. Dec., at 31. And except for the Ninth Circuit, all\nof the Courts of Appeals to consider the question have in-\nterpreted the statute that way.\n                            B\n  Barton pushes back on that straightforward statutory in-\nterpretation and the longstanding position of the Board of\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nImmigration Appeals. Barton says that he may not be de-\nnied cancellation of removal based on his 1996 aggravated\nassault offenses because those offenses were not among the\noffenses of removal found by the Immigration Judge in Bar-\nton\u2019s removal proceeding. Rather, his 1996 firearms offense\nand his 2007 and 2008 drug offenses were the offenses of\nremoval.\n   To succinctly summarize the parties\u2019 different positions\n(with the difference highlighted in italics below): The Gov-\nernment would preclude cancellation of removal under this\nprovision if the lawful permanent resident committed a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of resi-\ndence. Barton would preclude cancellation of removal un-\nder this provision if the lawful permanent resident commit-\nted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of\nresidence and if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the of-\nfenses of removal in the noncitizen\u2019s removal proceeding.\n   To support his \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach, Barton ad-\nvances three different arguments. A caution to the reader:\nThese arguments are not easy to unpack.\n   First, according to Barton, the statute\u2019s overall structure\nwith respect to removal proceedings demonstrates that a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense may preclude cancellation of removal\nonly if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the offenses of\nremoval. We disagree. In removal proceedings, a lawful\npermanent resident (such as Barton) may be found \u201cdeport-\nable\u201d based on deportability offenses listed in \u00a71227(a)(2).\nA noncitizen who has not previously been admitted may be\nfound \u201cinadmissible\u201d based on inadmissibility offenses\nlisted in \u00a71182(a)(2). See \u00a7\u00a71182(a), 1227(a), 1229a(e)(2).\nImportantly, then, \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\nfenses\u2014are typically the basis for removal of lawful perma-\nnent residents.\n   Because the offense of removal for lawful permanent res-\nidents is ordinarily a \u00a71227(a)(2) offense, Barton\u2019s struc-\ntural argument falls apart. If Barton were correct that this\n\f12                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naspect of the cancellation-of-removal statute focused only\non the offense of removal, the statute presumably would\nspecify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or section\n1227(a)(2).\u201d So why does the statute identify only offenses\n\u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d? Barton has no good an-\nswer. At oral argument, when directly asked that question,\nBarton\u2019s able counsel forthrightly acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s a lit-\ntle hard to explain.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.\n   This point is the Achilles\u2019 heel of Barton\u2019s structural ar-\ngument. As we see it, Barton cannot explain the omission\nof \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses in the \u201creferred to\u201d clause for a sim-\nple reason: Barton\u2019s interpretation of the statute is incor-\nrect. Properly read, this is not simply an \u201coffense of re-\nmoval\u201d statute that looks only at whether the offense of\nremoval was committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence. Rather, this is a recidivist statute that uses\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses as a shorthand cross-reference for a\ncategory of offenses that will preclude cancellation of re-\nmoval if committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence.\n   By contrast to this cancellation-of-removal provision,\nsome other provisions of the immigration laws do focus only\non the offense of removal\u2014for example, provisions govern-\ning mandatory detention and jurisdiction. See \u00a7\u00a71226(a),\n(c)(1)(A), (B), 1252(a)(2)(C). But the statutory text and con-\ntext of those provisions support that limitation. Those pro-\nvisions use the phrase \u201cinadmissible by reason of \u201d a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense, \u201cdeportable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71227(a)(2)\noffense, or \u201cremovable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71182(a)(2) or\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense. And the provisions make contextual\nsense only if the offense justifying detention or denying ju-\nrisdiction is one of the offenses of removal. The cancellation-\nof-removal statute does not employ similar language.\n   Second, moving from overall structure to precise text,\nBarton seizes on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an of-\nfense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). According\nto Barton, conviction of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2)\u2014for\nexample, conviction in state court of a crime involving\nmoral turpitude\u2014does not itself render the noncitizen \u201cin-\nadmissible.\u201d He argues that a noncitizen is not rendered\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d unless and until the noncitizen is actually\nadjudicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the\nUnited States. And he further contends that a lawfully ad-\nmitted noncitizen usually cannot be removed from the\nUnited States on the basis of inadmissibility. As Barton\nputs it (and the dissent echoes the point), how can a law-\nfully admitted noncitizen be found inadmissible when he\nhas already been lawfully admitted?\n  As a matter of common parlance alone, that argument\nwould of course carry some force. But the argument fails\nbecause it disregards the statutory text, which employs the\nterm \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a status that can result from, for\nexample, a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully admitted\nnoncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2).\n  For example, as relevant here, \u00a71182(a)(2) flatly says that\na noncitizen such as Barton who commits a crime involving\nmoral turpitude and is convicted of that offense \u201cis inadmis-\nsible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). Full stop. Similarly, a noncitizen\nwho has two or more convictions, together resulting in ag-\ngregate sentences of at least five years, \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n\u00a71182(a)(2)(B). A noncitizen who a consular officer or the\nAttorney General knows or has reason to believe is a drug\ntrafficker \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(i). A noncitizen\nwho receives the proceeds of prostitution within 10 years of\napplying for admission \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(D)(ii).\nThe list goes on. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(ii)\u2013(E), (G)\u2013(I).\nThose provisions do not say that a noncitizen will become\ninadmissible if the noncitizen is found inadmissible in a\nsubsequent immigration removal proceeding. Instead,\n\f14                      BARTON v. BARR\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthose provisions say that the noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n  Congress has in turn made that status\u2014inadmissibility\nbecause of conviction or other proof of commission of\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014relevant in several statutory contexts\nthat apply to lawfully admitted noncitizens such as Barton.\nThose contexts include adjustment to permanent resident\nstatus; protection from removal because of temporary pro-\ntected status; termination of temporary resident status;\nand here cancellation of removal. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C),\n(a)(3)(B)(ii), 1254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii), 1255(a), (l)(2). In\nthose contexts, the noncitizen faces immigration conse-\nquences from being convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even\nthough the noncitizen is lawfully admitted and is not nec-\nessarily removable solely because of that offense.\n  Consider how those other proceedings work. A lawfully\nadmitted noncitizen who is convicted of an offense listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) is typically not removable from the United\nStates on that basis (recall that a lawfully admitted noncit-\nizen is ordinarily removable only for commission of a\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense). But the noncitizen is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause of the \u00a71182(a)(2) offense and for that reason may\nnot be able to obtain adjustment to permanent resident sta-\ntus. \u00a7\u00a71255(a), (l)(2). So too, a lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho is convicted of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) is \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d and for that reason may not be able to obtain tem-\nporary protected status. \u00a7\u00a71254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii). A\nlawfully admitted noncitizen who is a temporary resident\nand is convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand for that reason may lose temporary resident status.\n\u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii).\n  Those statutory examples pose a major hurdle for Bar-\nton\u2019s textual argument. The examples demonstrate that\nCongress has employed the concept of \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as\na status in a variety of statutes similar to the cancellation-\nof-removal statute, including for lawfully admitted nonciti-\nzens. Barton has no persuasive answer to those examples.\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            15\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nBarton tries to say that some of those other statutes involve\na noncitizen who, although already admitted to the United\nStates, is nonetheless seeking \u201cconstructive admission.\u201d\nReply Brief 12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But that ginned-up label\ndoes not avoid the problem. Put simply, those other stat-\nutes show that lawfully admitted noncitizens who are, for\nexample, convicted of \u00a71182(a)(2) crimes are \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand in turn may suffer certain immigration consequences,\neven though those lawfully admitted noncitizens cannot\nnecessarily be removed solely because of those \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffenses.\n   The same is true here. A lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude dur-\ning his initial seven years of residence is \u201cinadmissible\u201d and\nfor that reason is ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n   In advancing his structural and textual arguments, Bar-\nton insists that his interpretation of the statute reflects con-\ngressional intent regarding cancellation of removal. But if\nCongress intended that only the offense of removal would\npreclude cancellation of removal under the 7-year residence\nprovision, it is unlikely that Congress would have employed\nsuch a convoluted way to express that intent. Barton can-\nnot explain why, if his view of Congress\u2019 intent is correct,\nthe statute does not simply say something like: \u201cThe alien\nis not eligible for cancellation of removal if the offense of\nremoval was committed during the alien\u2019s initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d\n   Third, on a different textual tack, Barton argues that the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation cannot be correct because the\nGovernment would treat as surplusage the phrase \u201cor re-\nmovable from the United States under section 1227(a)(2) or\n1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d Recall that the statute, as relevant\nhere, provides that a lawful permanent resident is not eli-\ngible for cancellation of removal if, during the initial seven\nyears of residence, he committed \u201can offense referred to in\n\f16                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the alien inad-\nmissible to the United States under section 1182(a)(2) of\nthis title or removable from the United States under section\n1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (em-\nphasis added).\n   To begin with, all agree that under either side\u2019s interpre-\ntation, the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4)\u2014as distinct from\n\u00a71227(a)(2)\u2014is redundant surplusage. See \u00a71229b(c)(4);\nBrief for Petitioner 32\u201333 & n. 7. Under the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation, it is true that the reference to \u00a71227(a)(2)\nalso appears to be redundant surplusage. Any offense that\nis both referred to in \u00a71182(a)(2) and an offense that would\nrender the noncitizen deportable under \u00a71227(a)(2) would\nalso render the noncitizen inadmissible under \u00a71182(a)(2).\nBut redundancies are common in statutory drafting\u2014some-\ntimes in a congressional effort to be doubly sure, sometimes\nbecause of congressional inadvertence or lack of foresight,\nor sometimes simply because of the shortcomings of human\ncommunication. The Court has often recognized: \u201cSome-\ntimes the better overall reading of the statute contains\nsome redundancy.\u201d Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc.,\n586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11); see Wisconsin Cen-\ntral Ltd. v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op.,\nat 7); Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. 371, 385\n(2013); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 536\n(2004). So it is here. Most importantly for present pur-\nposes, we do not see why the redundant statutory reference\nto \u00a71227(a)(2) should cause us to entirely rewrite \u00a71229b so\nthat a noncitizen\u2019s commission of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) would preclude cancellation of removal only if it\nis also the offense of removal. Redundancy in one portion\nof a statute is not a license to rewrite or eviscerate another\nportion of the statute contrary to its text, as Barton would\nhave us do.\n   One final point: Barton argues in the alternative that\neven if inadmissibility is a status, and even if the offense\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat precludes cancellation of removal need not be one of\nthe offenses of removal, the noncitizen must at least have\nbeen capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmis-\nsibility offense as the basis for removal. The dissent seizes\non this argument as well. But as we have explained, this\ncancellation-of-removal statute is a recidivist statute that\nprecludes cancellation of removal if the noncitizen has com-\nmitted an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial\nseven years of residence. Whether the offense that pre-\ncludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have\nbeen charged as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant\nto that analysis.\n                         *     *    *\n   Removal of a lawful permanent resident from the United\nStates is a wrenching process, especially in light of the con-\nsequences for family members. Removal is particularly dif-\nficult when it involves someone such as Barton who has\nspent most of his life in the United States. Congress made\na choice, however, to authorize removal of noncitizens\u2014\neven lawful permanent residents\u2014who have committed\ncertain serious crimes. And Congress also made a choice to\ncategorically preclude cancellation of removal for nonciti-\nzens who have substantial criminal records. Congress may\nof course amend the law at any time. In the meantime, the\nCourt is constrained to apply the law as enacted by Con-\ngress. Here, as the BIA explained in its 2006 Jurado-\nDelgado decision, and as the Second, Third, Fifth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits have indicated, the immigration laws enacted\nby Congress do not allow cancellation of removal when a\nlawful permanent resident has amassed a criminal record\nof this kind.\n   We affirm the judgment of the U.

But to trigger the rule, it takes more than\ncommission of a specified criminal offense: The offense\nmust also render a noncitizen either \u201cinadmissible\u201d or \u201cde-\nportable.\u201d In applying these important limitations, the rule\ndirectly references the two-track nature of the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), a statute that has long distin-\nguished between noncitizens seeking admission and those\nalready admitted. Inadmissibility, of course, pertains to\nnoncitizens seeking admission; deportability relates to\nnoncitizens already admitted but removable.\n  The majority errs by conflating these two terms. It con-\ncludes that the term \u201cinadmissible,\u201d for the purposes of the\nstop-time rule, refers to a status that a noncitizen could ac-\nquire even if he or she is not seeking admission. Under this\nlogic, petitioner Andre Barton is inadmissible yet, at the\nsame time, lawfully admitted. Neither the express lan-\nguage of the statute nor any interpretative canons support\nthis paradox; Barton cannot and should not be considered\ninadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule because he\nhas already been admitted to the country.

The second clause directly invokes grounds of\ninadmissibility; the third clause, although using the term\n\u201cremovable,\u201d directly invokes grounds of deportability. See\n\u00a71227(a) (specifying \u201c[c]lasses of deportable aliens\u201d).1 Both\nthe second and the third clauses are cabined by the first: In\naddition to rendering a noncitizen either inadmissible or\ndeportable, the offense must also be one \u201creferred to\u201d in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). That provision includes some\u2014but not all\u2014of\nthe grounds of deportability in \u00a71227.\n  This distinction between \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d\nmatters.

Although the grounds for\nexclusion and deportation\u2014and the procedures applying to\neach\u2014evolved over time, the immigration laws retained a\ntwo-track system; different procedures and processes ap-\nplied to noncitizens who were deportable and noncitizens\nwho were excludable.

S., at 46. IIRIRA also altered when a noncitizen faces\ngrounds of inadmissibility, formerly exclusion: Rather than\nfocusing on whether a noncitizen had physically entered the\ncountry, the statute now asks whether the noncitizen had\nbeen lawfully admitted, in any status, to the country. See\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(13)(A), 1182(a).\n  Still, the immigration laws have retained their two-track\nstructure. Inadmissibility and deportability remain sepa-\nrate concepts, triggered by different grounds. With few ex-\nceptions, the grounds for inadmissibility are broader than\nthose for deportability. Compare \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) with\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i) (reflecting different treatment for crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude). Further, while a noncitizen\n\f4                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncharged with inadmissibility bears the ultimate burden to\nshow that he is admissible, the Government bears the bur-\nden of demonstrating that a noncitizen is deportable.\n\u00a7\u00a71229a(c)(2), (c)(3).\n   Whether a noncitizen is charged with inadmissibility or\ndeportability also affects what the noncitizen or the Gov-\nernment must show to carry their respective burdens. A\ncriminal ground for inadmissibility can be made out by\nshowing either that the noncitizen admitted to conduct\nmeeting the elements of a crime or that she was actually\nconvicted of an offense. See, e.g., Pazcoguin v. Radcliffe,\n292 F. 3d 1209, 1213\u20131215 (CA9 2002) (noncitizen inadmis-\nsible because he admitted to health officer that he smoked\nmarijuana in his youth); see also \u00a71182(a)(2)(A). By con-\ntrast, most criminal grounds for deportability can be estab-\nlished only through convictions. See \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(v),\n(a)(2)(B)(i).\n   Finally, the substantive standards for cancellation of re-\nmoval are also less stringent for a subset of deportable\nnoncitizens: LPRs like Barton. Among other things, while\nan otherwise-eligible LPR must merely demonstrate that\nhe or she deserves the relief as a matter of discretion, see\nIn re C-V-T-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7, 10\u201311 (BIA 1998), non-LPRs\nmust demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual\nhardship to an LPR or citizen parent, spouse, or child,\n\u00a71229b(b)(1)(D).\n   These separate categories and procedures\u2014treating de-\nportable noncitizens more generously than inadmissible\nnoncitizens, and treating one group of deportable nonciti-\nzens (LPRs) the most generously of all\u2014stem from one an-\nimating principle. All noncitizens in this country are enti-\ntled to certain rights and protections, but the protections\nafforded to previously admitted noncitizens and LPRs are\nparticularly strong. See Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 543\u2013\n544 (2003) (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

Indeed, \u201c[t]he immigration laws give LPRs the op-\nportunity to establish a life permanently in this country by\ndeveloping economic, familial, and social ties indistinguish-\nable from those of a citizen.\u201d Id., at 544. Because those\nalready admitted, like Barton, are often presumed to have\ngreater connections to the country, the immigration laws\nuse separate terms and create separate procedures for\nnoncitizens seeking admission to the country on the one\nhand, and those who were previously admitted on the other.\n  The stop-time rule carries that distinction forward. The\nrule specifies how a period of continuous residence ends for\nnoncitizens who are seeking admission and thus are inad-\nmissible, as well as noncitizens who are already admitted\nand thus are deportable. By using separate terms and\ngrounds for two groups of people, the stop-time rule thus\nreflects the two-track dichotomy for inadmissible or deport-\nable noncitizens that pervades the INA.\n                               B\n  Barton is a longtime lawfully admitted resident of the\nUnited States. He and his mother moved to the United\nStates from Jamaica when he was about 10 years old. They\nboth entered legally and, through Barton\u2019s stepfather, soon\nadjusted their status to LPRs. When Barton was placed in\nremoval proceedings, all of his immediate family\u2014his\nmother, his children, his fiancee\u2014were living in the United\nStates. He had not returned to Jamaica in 25 years.\n  Barton was first arrested in 1996, when he was 17 or 18,\nafter a friend shot at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house while he was\npresent. Both he and his friend were convicted of, among\nother things, aggravated assault and possession of a fire-\narm. Barton later testified before an immigration judge\nthat he was unaware that his friend had a gun or was plan-\nning to shoot it.\n  After attending a boot camp and obtaining his GED, Bar-\nton led a law-abiding life for several years. But in the mid-\n\f6                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n2000s, Barton developed a drug problem and was convicted\ntwice on possession charges. After attending two drug re-\nhabilitation programs, Barton was never arrested again.\nHe graduated from college, began running an automobile\nrepair shop, and became a father to four young children.\n  Just a few years ago\u2014nearly 10 years after his last ar-\nrest\u2014the Government detained Barton and placed him in\nremoval proceedings. Because he had been lawfully admit-\nted to the country, the Government could not charge him\nwith any grounds of inadmissibility. Rather, the Govern-\nment charged, and Barton conceded, that he was deportable\nbased on prior firearms and drug convictions. (All agree\nthat Barton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense did not qualify as\na deportable offense under \u00a71227.) Barton then sought can-\ncellation of removal.\n  Perhaps recognizing that Barton had a strong case for\ncancellation of removal on the merits, see C-V-T-, 22 I. & N.\nDec., at 11 (factors such as \u201cfamily ties within the United\nStates, residence of long duration in this country (particu-\nlarly when the inception of residence occurred at a young\nage),\u201d and \u201cbusiness ties\u201d all favor a noncitizen seeking can-\ncellation), the Government contended that Barton was cat-\negorically ineligible for that relief. It reasoned that Bar-\nton\u2019s prior offenses triggered the stop-time rule and that\nBarton therefore could not meet the continuous-residence\nrequirement.\n  The problem (for the Government) was finding a prior of-\nfense that actually triggered the stop-time rule. None of the\noffenses that had made Barton deportable\u2014his firearms\nand drug convictions\u2014satisfied the stop-time rule\u2019s first\nclause because \u00a71182(a)(2) does not \u201crefe[r] to\u201d those of-\nfenses. The Government therefore could not argue that\nBarton\u2019s firearms and drug offenses ended Barton\u2019s period\nof continuous residence under the stop-time rule. As for\nBarton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense, it was not a ground for\ndeportability under \u00a71227(a) and therefore did not render\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

That is, although the Government could\nnot charge Barton with inadmissibility, it relied upon a\nground of inadmissibility to assert that Barton was not en-\ntitled to relief from removal.\n   The Immigration Judge agreed with the Government.\nThe judge made clear, however, that she would have\ngranted Barton\u2019s cancellation application had he satisfied\nthe continuous-residence requirement. The judge cited,\namong other things, Barton\u2019s strong family ties, including\nhis four young children who were all U. S. citizens. The\njudge concluded that because \u201chis last arrest was over 10\nyears ago,\u201d Barton \u201cis clearly rehabilitated.\u201d The judge also\nconcluded that Barton\u2019s family \u201crelies on him and would\nsuffer hardship if he were to be deported to Jamaica.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 36a.\n                             II\n  Barton makes two arguments to this Court. The Court\nfocuses on the first\u2014that the stop-time rule will \u201crende[r]\u201d\na noncitizen inadmissible only if the person is actually ad-\njudicated inadmissible based on the given offense. But\nwhether Barton is right on that score is irrelevant because\nBarton\u2019s second argument\u2014which the Court fails to grap-\nple with meaningfully\u2014is surely correct: At the very least,\nan offense cannot \u201crende[r]\u201d someone inadmissible unless\nthe Government can legally charge that noncitizen with a\nground of inadmissibility. That is, the stop-time rule is con-\nsistent with basic immigration law: A noncitizen who has\nalready been admitted, and is not seeking readmission, can-\nnot be charged with any ground of inadmissibility and thus\ncannot be deemed inadmissible.\n\f8                           BARTON v. BARR\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Because the stop-time rule uses the terms \u201cremovable\u201d\n(i.e., deportable) and \u201cinadmissible\u201d in the disjunctive, the\nCourt must analyze the rule against the INA\u2019s historic two-\ntrack backdrop. That context confirms that the term \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d cannot refer to a noncitizen who, like Barton, has\nalready been admitted and is not seeking readmission. In-\ndeed, the terms \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d are mutu-\nally exclusive in removal proceedings: A noncitizen can be\ndeemed either inadmissible or deportable, not both.\n\u00a71229a(e) (for the purposes of removal statute and\n\u00a71229b\u2014governing cancellation of removal\u2014a noncitizen is\n\u201cinadmissible under section 1182\u201d if \u201cnot admitted to the\nUnited States,\u201d and \u201cdeportable under section 1227\u201d if \u201cad-\nmitted to the United States\u201d). For the purposes of the stop-\ntime rule, a person is not \u201cinadmissible\u201d unless that person\nactually seeks admission, and thus is subject to charges of\ninadmissibility.\n   After all, if the provision applied to those who could hy-\npothetically be rendered inadmissible, it could have said so.\nFor example, the statute would have said that it applied\nwhen \u201cthe alien has committed an offense referred to in sec-\ntion 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d that either (2) \u201ccould render the\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or (3) could render the noncitizen\n\u201cremovable [i.e., deportable] from the United States under\nsection 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court seems to suggest that the stop-time rule\u2019s tense simply\n\nmirrors \u00a71182(a)(2). See ante, at 13\u201314. It is true that \u00a71182(a)(2)\nspeaks in the present tense, stating that a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible\u201d if\nshe has been \u201cconvicted of \u201d or \u201cadmits having committed\u201d certain of-\nfenses. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i).

Because the provision applies only to\nnoncitizens seeking admission, it is only natural that the clause uses the\npresent tense to describe when such a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d By\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

Were the stop-time rule agnostic to whether\nthe noncitizen actually seeks admission, then the rule\u2019s\nthird clause\u2014regarding deportability\u2014would be meaning-\nless. When a noncitizen is \u201cremovable\u201d\u2014i.e., deportable\u2014\nunder \u00a71227 for an offense \u201creferred to\u201d in \u00a71182(a)(2), he\nor she is also \u201cinadmissible\u201d for an offense \u201creferred to\u201d in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). The third clause has meaning only if inadmis-\nsibility and deportability apply, as they always have, to sep-\narate groups of noncitizens\u2014noncitizens seeking admission\non the one hand, and noncitizens already admitted on the\nother.\n   To be sure, there are limited exceptions to the general\nrule that questions of admissibility apply only to nonciti-\nzens seeking formal admission.

Were inadmissibility a status un-\ntethered to admission, a noncitizen inadmissible at the time of entry\nwould always be inadmissible. But because a noncitizen who was al-\nready admitted cannot be adjudicated inadmissible, Congress made er-\nroneous admission a ground of deportability, not inadmissibility.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            11\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   By contrast, the Government concedes that the term \u201cin-\nadmissible\u201d in the mandatory-detention statute\u2014a provi-\nsion structurally similar to the stop-time rule\u2014applies only\nto noncitizens capable of being charged with inadmissibil-\nity. Brief for Respondent 30. That provision specifies, in\nrelevant part, that the Government \u201cshall take into custody\nany alien who\u2014(A) is inadmissible by reason of having com-\nmitted any offense covered in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d or \u201c(C) is\ndeportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) . . . on the basis of\nan offense for which the alien has been sentence[d] to a\nterm of imprisonment of at least 1 year.\u201d \u00a71226(c)(1) (foot-\nnote omitted).\n   Although the term \u201cinadmissible\u201d in this context does not\nrefer to an actual adjudication of inadmissibility, see\nDemore, 538 U. S., at 513, 531, the Government accepts\nthat it must at least refer to a possible charge on a nonciti-\nzen seeking admission. Brief for Respondent 30. Other-\nwise, the statute would subject already-admitted nonciti-\nzens\u2014even those who are not deportable for any criminal\noffense\u2014to mandatory detention, simply because they oc-\ncupy the \u201cstatus\u201d of inadmissibility. This provision\u2019s struc-\nture is virtually the same as the stop-time rule: It refers to\ngrounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportability sep-\narately and applies to a noncitizen in removal proceedings.\n   Given the similar structure, the stop-time rule should be\nread the same as the mandatory-detention provision: to re-\nfer to adjudications that are possible rather than impossi-\nble. If a noncitizen seeking admission has committed a\ncrime under \u00a71182(a)(2) and is convicted of or admits to the\noffense, that offense \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause the noncitizen can be charged and found inadmis-\nsible based on that crime. But such an offense does not ren-\nder a noncitizen inadmissible if, like Barton, he or she was\nadmitted years earlier and does not seek readmission. For\na noncitizen who has already been admitted, Congress\ncarved out a separate category of offenses in both the stop-\n\f12                    BARTON v.

At various points the Court\nseems to ignore the rule\u2019s second and third clauses en-\ntirely\u2014clauses that, as mentioned above, distinguish be-\ntween grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportabil-\nity. The Court insists that the statute \u201coperates like\ntraditional criminal recidivist laws\u201d because it precludes\ncancellation of removal for a noncitizen who \u201chas committed\nan offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d Ante, at 2; see also ante, at 7, 8, n. 5,\n17.\n   Had Congress intended for commission of a crime in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) alone to trigger the stop-time rule, it would\nhave said so. In fact, it would have stopped at the rule\u2019s\nfirst clause, which (without more) states the Court\u2019s rule:\nthat the time of continuous residence stops whenever a\nnoncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in section\n1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1).\n   But that reading ignores the rest of what Congress wrote.\nCongress specified that it is not enough for a noncitizen to\ncommit a crime listed in \u00a71182(a)(2); that crime must also\n\u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible to the United States under\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or \u201cremovable from the\nUnited States under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this\ntitle.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1). Those words have meaning\u2014invoking\nthe two-track structure of the INA and the distinction be-\ntween grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportabil-\nity\u2014and the Court cannot simply will them out of existence.\n   Even when the Court finally discusses the second clause,\n\u201crenders the alien inadmissible,\u201d the Court raises more\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

First, the Court claims, the clause\nmakes clear that \u201ccancellation of removal is precluded if an\nalien committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial\nseven years of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the\nconviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\u201d Ante, at\n9. Despite the emphasis the Court lays on this point, it is\nirrelevant to this case: Barton does not dispute that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by the date of commission of a\ncrime rather than a later date of conviction. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 9, n. 4. The question in this case is whether certain\noffenses can possibly render Barton inadmissible when he\ndoes not seek admission and has already been admitted\u2014\nregardless of whether one looks to the date of commission\nor the date of conviction of those offenses.5\n   Even if this question mattered and were properly before\nus, Congress could have made the same point\u2014that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by commission of a crime\u2014by\nomitting the second and third clauses entirely. It again\ncould have written what the Court, at various points, seems\nto wish it had written: The stop-time rule is triggered when-\never a noncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d The second and third\nclauses\u2014which refer to later events, when a noncitizen is\nactually \u201crender[ed]\u201d inadmissible or deportable\u2014make the\nCourt\u2019s aside less plausible, not more.\n   The Court next insists that the second clause makes clear\nthat the crime must \u201crende[r]\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissi-\nble\u201d\u2014which, in the Court\u2019s view, requires only that a\nnoncitizen admit the crime or be convicted of it. Ante, at 10.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Courts have split over what event triggers the stop-time rule\u2014com-\n\nmission of the offense or a second, later point at which the offense \u201cren-\nder[s]\u201d the noncitizen inadmissible. Brief for Momodoulamin Jobe et al.\nas Amici Curiae 12\u201313. Because this point about the trigger date is nei-\nther disputed here nor briefed by either party, the Court\u2019s opinion should\nnot be read to resolve a Circuit split that is not before this Court.\n\f14                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nBut given the INA\u2019s historic two-track structure, a nonciti-\nzen is not \u201crender[ed]\u201d inadmissible when convicted of an\noffense that cannot serve as a ground of removal at all. The\nCourt also fails to clarify why, if conviction or admission\nalone renders any noncitizen inadmissible regardless of ad-\nmission status, Congress chose to add a third clause refer-\nring to grounds of deportability.\n  Indeed, what does the Court do about the canon against\nsurplusage? The Court does not dispute that its reading\nmakes the entire third clause of the stop-time rule mean-\ningless. It offers only two rejoinders: (1) that the reference\nto subsection (a)(4) in the third clause is superfluous under\neither party\u2019s reading, and (2) that a bit of surplusage\nmakes no difference in any event.

With virtually\nevery other provision of the INA, Congress granted prefer-\nential treatment to lawfully admitted noncitizens\u2014and\nmost of all to LPRs like Barton.

If the lawful permanent resident is found\n removable, the immigration judge may cancel removal, but only if the\n lawful permanent resident meets strict statutory eligibility require-\n ments. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), 1229b(d)(1)(B).\n    Over the span of 12 years, lawful permanent resident Andre Barton\n was convicted of state crimes, including a firearms offense, drug of-\n fenses, and aggravated assault offenses. An Immigration Judge found\n him removable based on his state firearms and drug offenses. Barton\n applied for cancellation of removal. Among the eligibility require-\n ments, a lawful permanent resident must have \u201cresided in the United\n States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any sta-\n tus.\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(2). Another provision, the so-called stop-time rule,\n provides that a continuous period of residence \u201cshall be deemed to end\u201d\n when the lawful permanent resident commits \u201can offense referred to\n in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible to the\n United States under section 1182(a)(2).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). Because\n Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were committed within his first\n seven years of admission and were covered by \u00a71182(a)(2), the Immi-\n gration Judge concluded that Barton was not eligible for cancellation\n of removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals and the Eleventh Cir-\n cuit agreed.\nHeld: For purposes of cancellation-of-removal eligibility, a \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\n fense committed during the initial seven years of residence does not\n need to be one of the offenses of removal. Pp. 6\u201317.\n    (a) The cancellation-of-removal statute functions like a traditional\n\f2                            BARTON v. BARR\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    recidivist sentencing statute, making a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes rele-\n    vant to eligibility for cancellation of removal. The statute\u2019s text clari-\n    fies two points relevant here. First, cancellation of removal is pre-\n    cluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the noncitizen\n    \u201ccommitted an offense referred to in section 1182(a)(2),\u201d even if (as in\n    Barton\u2019s case) the conviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\n    Second, the offense must \u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible\u201d as a result.\n    For crimes involving moral turpitude, the relevant category here,\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) provides that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when\n    he is convicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n       As a matter of statutory text and structure, the analysis here is\n    straightforward. Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were crimes in-\n    volving moral turpitude and therefore \u201creferred to in section\n    1182(a)(2).\u201d He committed the offenses during his initial seven years\n    of residence and was later convicted of the offenses, thereby rendering\n    him \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Barton was, therefore, ineligible for cancellation\n    of removal. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Barton\u2019s counterarguments are unpersuasive. First, he claims\n    that the statute\u2019s structure supports an \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach.\n    But \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014are ordinarily the\n    basis for removal of lawful permanent residents. Therefore, Barton\u2019s\n    structural argument falls apart. If he were correct, the statute pre-\n    sumably would specify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or sec-\n    tion 1227(a)(2).\u201d By contrast, some other immigration law provisions\n    do focus only on the offense of removal, and their statutory text and\n    context support that limitation.          See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71226(a), (c)(1)(A),\n    1252(a)(2)(C).\n       Second, seizing on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an offense re-\n    ferred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible\n    to the United States under section 1182(a)(2),\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B), Barton\n    argues that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when actually ad-\n    judicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the United States,\n    something that usually cannot happen to a lawfully admitted nonciti-\n    zen. But the statutory text employs the term \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a\n    status that can result from, e.g., a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully\n    admitted noncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n    \u00a71182(a)(2). See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (B). And Congress has made\n    that status relevant in several statutory contexts that apply to law-\n    fully admitted noncitizens such as Barton. In those contexts, a noncit-\n    izen faces immigration consequences from being convicted of a\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even though the noncitizen is lawfully admitted\n    and is not necessarily removable solely because of that offense. See,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii). Such examples pose a major hurdle\n    for Barton\u2019s textual argument, and Barton has no persuasive answer.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     Third, Barton argues that the Government\u2019s interpretation treats as\n  surplusage the phrase \u201cor removable from the United States under\n  section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4).\u201d But redundancies are common in\n  statutory drafting. The Court has often recognized that sometimes the\n  better overall reading of a statute contains some redundancy. And re-\n  dundancy in one portion of a statute is not a license to rewrite or evis-\n  cerate another portion of the statute contrary to its text.\n     Finally, Barton argues alternatively that, even if inadmissibility is\n  a status, and even if the offense that precludes cancellation of removal\n  need not be one of the offenses of removal, a noncitizen must at least\n  have been capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmissibility\n  offense as the basis for removal. Because the cancellation-of-removal\n  statute is a recidivist statute, however, whether the offense that pre-\n  cludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have been charged\n  as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant.

But unlike a U. S. citizen, a lawful permanent\nresident who commits a serious crime may be removed from\nthe United States.\n   Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a longtime law-\nful permanent resident of the United States. During his\ntime in the United States, Barton has been convicted of\nstate crimes on three separate occasions spanning 12 years.\nThe crimes include a firearms offense, drug offenses, and\naggravated assault offenses. By law, the firearms offense\nand the drug offenses each independently rendered Barton\neligible for removal from the United States. In September\n2016, the U. S. Government sought to remove Barton,\nand a U. S. Immigration Judge determined that Barton was\nremovable.\n   Barton applied for cancellation of removal, a form of relief\nthat allows a noncitizen to remain in the United States de-\n\f2                         BARTON v.

The\nlaw defines those offenses by cross-referencing \u00a71182(a)(2),\nwhich specifies the offenses that can render a noncitizen\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d to the United States. Section 1182(a)(2) in-\ncludes \u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude,\u201d which is a gen-\neral category that covers a wide variety of crimes. Section\n1182(a)(2) also expressly encompasses various violations of\ndrug laws, prostitution, money laundering, and certain\nDUIs involving personal injury, among other crimes.\n\f8                          BARTON v. BARR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (C), (D), (E), (I); see \u00a71101(h).\n   In specifying when cancellation of removal would be pre-\ncluded because of prior criminal activity, Congress struck a\nbalance that considers both the nature of the prior crime\nand the length of time that the noncitizen has resided in the\nUnited States. If a lawful permanent resident has been\nconvicted at any time of certain crimes (what the immigra-\ntion laws refer to as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d), then the\nnoncitizen is not eligible for cancellation of removal. If dur-\ning the initial 7-year period of residence, a lawful perma-\nnent resident committed certain other offenses referred to\nin \u00a71182(a)(2), then the noncitizen likewise is not eligible\nfor cancellation of removal.\n   In providing that a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes (in addition\nto the offense of removal) can render him ineligible for can-\ncellation of removal, the cancellation-of-removal statute\nfunctions like a traditional recidivist sentencing statute. In\nan ordinary criminal case, a defendant may be convicted of\na particular criminal offense. And at sentencing, the de-\nfendant\u2019s other criminal offenses may be relevant. So too\nin the immigration removal context. A noncitizen may be\nfound removable based on a certain criminal offense. In ap-\nplying for cancellation of removal, the noncitizen must de-\ntail his entire criminal record on Form EOIR\u201342A. An im-\nmigration judge then must determine whether the\nnoncitizen has been convicted of an aggravated felony at\nany time or has committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the\ninitial seven years of residence. It is entirely ordinary to\nlook beyond the offense of conviction at criminal sentencing,\nand it is likewise entirely ordinary to look beyond the of-\nfense of removal at the cancellation-of-removal stage in im-\nmigration cases.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 If the offense of removal itself was an aggravated felony or was an\n\noffense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) that was committed during the initial seven\nyears of residence, then the offense of removal alone precludes cancella-\ntion of removal, regardless of whether the noncitizen has an additional\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)        9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   It is not surprising, moreover, that Congress required im-\nmigration judges considering cancellation of removal to\nlook in part at whether the noncitizen has committed any\noffenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2). The offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) help determine whether a noncitizen should be\nadmitted to the United States. Under the cancellation-of-\nremoval statute, immigration judges must look at that\nsame category of offenses to determine whether, after a pre-\nviously admitted noncitizen has been determined to be de-\nportable, the noncitizen should nonetheless be allowed to\nremain in the United States. If a crime is serious enough\nto deny admission to a noncitizen, the crime can also be se-\nrious enough to preclude cancellation of removal, at least if\ncommitted during the initial seven years of residence.\n   Importantly, the text of the cancellation-of-removal stat-\nute does not simply say that cancellation of removal is pre-\ncluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the\nnoncitizen was convicted of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). Rather, the text says that cancellation of re-\nmoval is precluded when, during the initial seven years of\nresidence, the noncitizen \u201ccommitted an offense referred to\nin section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissi-\nble.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). That language clarifies two points of\nrelevance here.\n   First, cancellation of removal is precluded if a noncitizen\ncommitted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven\nyears of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the convic-\ntion occurred after the seven years elapsed. In other words,\nas Congress specified in the statute and as the BIA and the\nCourts of Appeals have recognized, the date of commission\nof the offense is the key date for purposes of calculating\nwhether the noncitizen committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense\nduring the initial seven years of residence.

Barton says that he may not be de-\nnied cancellation of removal based on his 1996 aggravated\nassault offenses because those offenses were not among the\noffenses of removal found by the Immigration Judge in Bar-\nton\u2019s removal proceeding. Rather, his 1996 firearms offense\nand his 2007 and 2008 drug offenses were the offenses of\nremoval.\n   To succinctly summarize the parties\u2019 different positions\n(with the difference highlighted in italics below): The Gov-\nernment would preclude cancellation of removal under this\nprovision if the lawful permanent resident committed a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of resi-\ndence. Barton would preclude cancellation of removal un-\nder this provision if the lawful permanent resident commit-\nted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of\nresidence and if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the of-\nfenses of removal in the noncitizen\u2019s removal proceeding.\n   To support his \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach, Barton ad-\nvances three different arguments. A caution to the reader:\nThese arguments are not easy to unpack.\n   First, according to Barton, the statute\u2019s overall structure\nwith respect to removal proceedings demonstrates that a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense may preclude cancellation of removal\nonly if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the offenses of\nremoval. We disagree. In removal proceedings, a lawful\npermanent resident (such as Barton) may be found \u201cdeport-\nable\u201d based on deportability offenses listed in \u00a71227(a)(2).\nA noncitizen who has not previously been admitted may be\nfound \u201cinadmissible\u201d based on inadmissibility offenses\nlisted in \u00a71182(a)(2). See \u00a7\u00a71182(a), 1227(a), 1229a(e)(2).\nImportantly, then, \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\nfenses\u2014are typically the basis for removal of lawful perma-\nnent residents.\n   Because the offense of removal for lawful permanent res-\nidents is ordinarily a \u00a71227(a)(2) offense, Barton\u2019s struc-\ntural argument falls apart. If Barton were correct that this\n\f12                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naspect of the cancellation-of-removal statute focused only\non the offense of removal, the statute presumably would\nspecify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or section\n1227(a)(2).\u201d So why does the statute identify only offenses\n\u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d? Barton has no good an-\nswer. At oral argument, when directly asked that question,\nBarton\u2019s able counsel forthrightly acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s a lit-\ntle hard to explain.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.\n   This point is the Achilles\u2019 heel of Barton\u2019s structural ar-\ngument. As we see it, Barton cannot explain the omission\nof \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses in the \u201creferred to\u201d clause for a sim-\nple reason: Barton\u2019s interpretation of the statute is incor-\nrect. Properly read, this is not simply an \u201coffense of re-\nmoval\u201d statute that looks only at whether the offense of\nremoval was committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence. Rather, this is a recidivist statute that uses\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses as a shorthand cross-reference for a\ncategory of offenses that will preclude cancellation of re-\nmoval if committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence.\n   By contrast to this cancellation-of-removal provision,\nsome other provisions of the immigration laws do focus only\non the offense of removal\u2014for example, provisions govern-\ning mandatory detention and jurisdiction. See \u00a7\u00a71226(a),\n(c)(1)(A), (B), 1252(a)(2)(C). But the statutory text and con-\ntext of those provisions support that limitation. Those pro-\nvisions use the phrase \u201cinadmissible by reason of \u201d a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense, \u201cdeportable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71227(a)(2)\noffense, or \u201cremovable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71182(a)(2) or\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense. And the provisions make contextual\nsense only if the offense justifying detention or denying ju-\nrisdiction is one of the offenses of removal. The cancellation-\nof-removal statute does not employ similar language.\n   Second, moving from overall structure to precise text,\nBarton seizes on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an of-\nfense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). According\nto Barton, conviction of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2)\u2014for\nexample, conviction in state court of a crime involving\nmoral turpitude\u2014does not itself render the noncitizen \u201cin-\nadmissible.\u201d He argues that a noncitizen is not rendered\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d unless and until the noncitizen is actually\nadjudicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the\nUnited States. And he further contends that a lawfully ad-\nmitted noncitizen usually cannot be removed from the\nUnited States on the basis of inadmissibility. As Barton\nputs it (and the dissent echoes the point), how can a law-\nfully admitted noncitizen be found inadmissible when he\nhas already been lawfully admitted?\n  As a matter of common parlance alone, that argument\nwould of course carry some force. But the argument fails\nbecause it disregards the statutory text, which employs the\nterm \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a status that can result from, for\nexample, a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully admitted\nnoncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2).\n  For example, as relevant here, \u00a71182(a)(2) flatly says that\na noncitizen such as Barton who commits a crime involving\nmoral turpitude and is convicted of that offense \u201cis inadmis-\nsible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). Full stop. Similarly, a noncitizen\nwho has two or more convictions, together resulting in ag-\ngregate sentences of at least five years, \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n\u00a71182(a)(2)(B). A noncitizen who a consular officer or the\nAttorney General knows or has reason to believe is a drug\ntrafficker \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(i). A noncitizen\nwho receives the proceeds of prostitution within 10 years of\napplying for admission \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(D)(ii).\nThe list goes on. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(ii)\u2013(E), (G)\u2013(I).\nThose provisions do not say that a noncitizen will become\ninadmissible if the noncitizen is found inadmissible in a\nsubsequent immigration removal proceeding. Instead,\n\f14                      BARTON v. BARR\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthose provisions say that the noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n  Congress has in turn made that status\u2014inadmissibility\nbecause of conviction or other proof of commission of\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014relevant in several statutory contexts\nthat apply to lawfully admitted noncitizens such as Barton.\nThose contexts include adjustment to permanent resident\nstatus; protection from removal because of temporary pro-\ntected status; termination of temporary resident status;\nand here cancellation of removal. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C),\n(a)(3)(B)(ii), 1254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii), 1255(a), (l)(2). In\nthose contexts, the noncitizen faces immigration conse-\nquences from being convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even\nthough the noncitizen is lawfully admitted and is not nec-\nessarily removable solely because of that offense.\n  Consider how those other proceedings work. A lawfully\nadmitted noncitizen who is convicted of an offense listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) is typically not removable from the United\nStates on that basis (recall that a lawfully admitted noncit-\nizen is ordinarily removable only for commission of a\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense). But the noncitizen is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause of the \u00a71182(a)(2) offense and for that reason may\nnot be able to obtain adjustment to permanent resident sta-\ntus. \u00a7\u00a71255(a), (l)(2). So too, a lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho is convicted of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) is \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d and for that reason may not be able to obtain tem-\nporary protected status. \u00a7\u00a71254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii). A\nlawfully admitted noncitizen who is a temporary resident\nand is convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand for that reason may lose temporary resident status.\n\u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii).\n  Those statutory examples pose a major hurdle for Bar-\nton\u2019s textual argument. The examples demonstrate that\nCongress has employed the concept of \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as\na status in a variety of statutes similar to the cancellation-\nof-removal statute, including for lawfully admitted nonciti-\nzens. Barton has no persuasive answer to those examples.\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            15\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nBarton tries to say that some of those other statutes involve\na noncitizen who, although already admitted to the United\nStates, is nonetheless seeking \u201cconstructive admission.\u201d\nReply Brief 12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But that ginned-up label\ndoes not avoid the problem. Put simply, those other stat-\nutes show that lawfully admitted noncitizens who are, for\nexample, convicted of \u00a71182(a)(2) crimes are \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand in turn may suffer certain immigration consequences,\neven though those lawfully admitted noncitizens cannot\nnecessarily be removed solely because of those \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffenses.\n   The same is true here. A lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude dur-\ning his initial seven years of residence is \u201cinadmissible\u201d and\nfor that reason is ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n   In advancing his structural and textual arguments, Bar-\nton insists that his interpretation of the statute reflects con-\ngressional intent regarding cancellation of removal. But if\nCongress intended that only the offense of removal would\npreclude cancellation of removal under the 7-year residence\nprovision, it is unlikely that Congress would have employed\nsuch a convoluted way to express that intent. Barton can-\nnot explain why, if his view of Congress\u2019 intent is correct,\nthe statute does not simply say something like: \u201cThe alien\nis not eligible for cancellation of removal if the offense of\nremoval was committed during the alien\u2019s initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d\n   Third, on a different textual tack, Barton argues that the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation cannot be correct because the\nGovernment would treat as surplusage the phrase \u201cor re-\nmovable from the United States under section 1227(a)(2) or\n1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d Recall that the statute, as relevant\nhere, provides that a lawful permanent resident is not eli-\ngible for cancellation of removal if, during the initial seven\nyears of residence, he committed \u201can offense referred to in\n\f16                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the alien inad-\nmissible to the United States under section 1182(a)(2) of\nthis title or removable from the United States under section\n1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (em-\nphasis added).\n   To begin with, all agree that under either side\u2019s interpre-\ntation, the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4)\u2014as distinct from\n\u00a71227(a)(2)\u2014is redundant surplusage. See \u00a71229b(c)(4);\nBrief for Petitioner 32\u201333 & n. 7. Under the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation, it is true that the reference to \u00a71227(a)(2)\nalso appears to be redundant surplusage. Any offense that\nis both referred to in \u00a71182(a)(2) and an offense that would\nrender the noncitizen deportable under \u00a71227(a)(2) would\nalso render the noncitizen inadmissible under \u00a71182(a)(2).\nBut redundancies are common in statutory drafting\u2014some-\ntimes in a congressional effort to be doubly sure, sometimes\nbecause of congressional inadvertence or lack of foresight,\nor sometimes simply because of the shortcomings of human\ncommunication. The Court has often recognized: \u201cSome-\ntimes the better overall reading of the statute contains\nsome redundancy.\u201d Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc.,\n586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11); see Wisconsin Cen-\ntral Ltd. v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op.,\nat 7); Marx v.

So it is here. Most importantly for present pur-\nposes, we do not see why the redundant statutory reference\nto \u00a71227(a)(2) should cause us to entirely rewrite \u00a71229b so\nthat a noncitizen\u2019s commission of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) would preclude cancellation of removal only if it\nis also the offense of removal. Redundancy in one portion\nof a statute is not a license to rewrite or eviscerate another\nportion of the statute contrary to its text, as Barton would\nhave us do.\n   One final point: Barton argues in the alternative that\neven if inadmissibility is a status, and even if the offense\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat precludes cancellation of removal need not be one of\nthe offenses of removal, the noncitizen must at least have\nbeen capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmis-\nsibility offense as the basis for removal. The dissent seizes\non this argument as well. But as we have explained, this\ncancellation-of-removal statute is a recidivist statute that\nprecludes cancellation of removal if the noncitizen has com-\nmitted an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial\nseven years of residence. Whether the offense that pre-\ncludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have\nbeen charged as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant\nto that analysis.\n                         *     *    *\n   Removal of a lawful permanent resident from the United\nStates is a wrenching process, especially in light of the con-\nsequences for family members. Removal is particularly dif-\nficult when it involves someone such as Barton who has\nspent most of his life in the United States. Congress made\na choice, however, to authorize removal of noncitizens\u2014\neven lawful permanent residents\u2014who have committed\ncertain serious crimes. And Congress also made a choice to\ncategorically preclude cancellation of removal for nonciti-\nzens who have substantial criminal records. Congress may\nof course amend the law at any time. In the meantime, the\nCourt is constrained to apply the law as enacted by Con-\ngress. Here, as the BIA explained in its 2006 Jurado-\nDelgado decision, and as the Second, Third, Fifth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits have indicated, the immigration laws enacted\nby Congress do not allow cancellation of removal when a\nlawful permanent resident has amassed a criminal record\nof this kind.\n   We affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

But to trigger the rule, it takes more than\ncommission of a specified criminal offense: The offense\nmust also render a noncitizen either \u201cinadmissible\u201d or \u201cde-\nportable.\u201d In applying these important limitations, the rule\ndirectly references the two-track nature of the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), a statute that has long distin-\nguished between noncitizens seeking admission and those\nalready admitted. Inadmissibility, of course, pertains to\nnoncitizens seeking admission; deportability relates to\nnoncitizens already admitted but removable.\n  The majority errs by conflating these two terms. It con-\ncludes that the term \u201cinadmissible,\u201d for the purposes of the\nstop-time rule, refers to a status that a noncitizen could ac-\nquire even if he or she is not seeking admission. Under this\nlogic, petitioner Andre Barton is inadmissible yet, at the\nsame time, lawfully admitted. Neither the express lan-\nguage of the statute nor any interpretative canons support\nthis paradox; Barton cannot and should not be considered\ninadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule because he\nhas already been admitted to the country. Thus, for the\n\f2                         BARTON v.

To obtain this relief, both\ngroups must continuously reside in the United States for a\ncertain amount of time. \u00a71229b(a)(2) (seven years for\nLPRs); \u00a71229b(b)(1)(A) (10 years for non-LPR noncitizens).\n  The stop-time rule ends a noncitizen\u2019s period of continu-\nous residence (1) when the noncitizen \u201chas committed an\noffense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d that\neither (2) \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible to the\nUnited States under section 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or (3)\nrenders the noncitizen \u201cremovable from the United States\nunder section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(d)(1). The second clause directly invokes grounds of\ninadmissibility; the third clause, although using the term\n\u201cremovable,\u201d directly invokes grounds of deportability. See\n\u00a71227(a) (specifying \u201c[c]lasses of deportable aliens\u201d).1 Both\nthe second and the third clauses are cabined by the first: In\naddition to rendering a noncitizen either inadmissible or\ndeportable, the offense must also be one \u201creferred to\u201d in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). That provision includes some\u2014but not all\u2014of\nthe grounds of deportability in \u00a71227.\n  This distinction between \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d\nmatters. Indeed, both are terms of art, so it is critical to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because the third clause refers to grounds of deportability, the Gov-\n\nernment appears to agree that the terms \u201cremovable\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d\nare interchangeable.

IIRIRA also altered when a noncitizen faces\ngrounds of inadmissibility, formerly exclusion: Rather than\nfocusing on whether a noncitizen had physically entered the\ncountry, the statute now asks whether the noncitizen had\nbeen lawfully admitted, in any status, to the country. See\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(13)(A), 1182(a).\n  Still, the immigration laws have retained their two-track\nstructure. Inadmissibility and deportability remain sepa-\nrate concepts, triggered by different grounds. With few ex-\nceptions, the grounds for inadmissibility are broader than\nthose for deportability. Compare \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) with\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i) (reflecting different treatment for crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude). Further, while a noncitizen\n\f4                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncharged with inadmissibility bears the ultimate burden to\nshow that he is admissible, the Government bears the bur-\nden of demonstrating that a noncitizen is deportable.\n\u00a7\u00a71229a(c)(2), (c)(3).\n   Whether a noncitizen is charged with inadmissibility or\ndeportability also affects what the noncitizen or the Gov-\nernment must show to carry their respective burdens. A\ncriminal ground for inadmissibility can be made out by\nshowing either that the noncitizen admitted to conduct\nmeeting the elements of a crime or that she was actually\nconvicted of an offense. See, e.g., Pazcoguin v. Radcliffe,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777938\"><a href=\"/opinion/777938/nathaniel-flores-pazcoguin-v-donald-a-radcliffe-district-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1213\u20131215 (CA9 2002) (noncitizen inadmis-\nsible because he admitted to health officer that he smoked\nmarijuana in his youth); see also \u00a71182(a)(2)(A). By con-\ntrast, most criminal grounds for deportability can be estab-\nlished only through convictions. See \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(v),\n(a)(2)(B)(i).\n   Finally, the substantive standards for cancellation of re-\nmoval are also less stringent for a subset of deportable\nnoncitizens: LPRs like Barton. Among other things, while\nan otherwise-eligible LPR must merely demonstrate that\nhe or she deserves the relief as a matter of discretion, see\nIn re C-V-T-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7, 10\u201311 (BIA 1998), non-LPRs\nmust demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual\nhardship to an LPR or citizen parent, spouse, or child,\n\u00a71229b(b)(1)(D).\n   These separate categories and procedures\u2014treating de-\nportable noncitizens more generously than inadmissible\nnoncitizens, and treating one group of deportable nonciti-\nzens (LPRs) the most generously of all\u2014stem from one an-\nimating principle.

The\nrule specifies how a period of continuous residence ends for\nnoncitizens who are seeking admission and thus are inad-\nmissible, as well as noncitizens who are already admitted\nand thus are deportable. By using separate terms and\ngrounds for two groups of people, the stop-time rule thus\nreflects the two-track dichotomy for inadmissible or deport-\nable noncitizens that pervades the INA.\n                               B\n  Barton is a longtime lawfully admitted resident of the\nUnited States. He and his mother moved to the United\nStates from Jamaica when he was about 10 years old. They\nboth entered legally and, through Barton\u2019s stepfather, soon\nadjusted their status to LPRs. When Barton was placed in\nremoval proceedings, all of his immediate family\u2014his\nmother, his children, his fiancee\u2014were living in the United\nStates. He had not returned to Jamaica in 25 years.\n  Barton was first arrested in 1996, when he was 17 or 18,\nafter a friend shot at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house while he was\npresent. Both he and his friend were convicted of, among\nother things, aggravated assault and possession of a fire-\narm. Barton later testified before an immigration judge\nthat he was unaware that his friend had a gun or was plan-\nning to shoot it.\n  After attending a boot camp and obtaining his GED, Bar-\nton led a law-abiding life for several years. But in the mid-\n\f6                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n2000s, Barton developed a drug problem and was convicted\ntwice on possession charges. After attending two drug re-\nhabilitation programs, Barton was never arrested again.\nHe graduated from college, began running an automobile\nrepair shop, and became a father to four young children.\n  Just a few years ago\u2014nearly 10 years after his last ar-\nrest\u2014the Government detained Barton and placed him in\nremoval proceedings. Because he had been lawfully admit-\nted to the country, the Government could not charge him\nwith any grounds of inadmissibility. Rather, the Govern-\nment charged, and Barton conceded, that he was deportable\nbased on prior firearms and drug convictions. (All agree\nthat Barton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense did not qualify as\na deportable offense under \u00a71227.) Barton then sought can-\ncellation of removal.\n  Perhaps recognizing that Barton had a strong case for\ncancellation of removal on the merits, see C-V-T-, 22 I. & N.\nDec., at 11 (factors such as \u201cfamily ties within the United\nStates, residence of long duration in this country (particu-\nlarly when the inception of residence occurred at a young\nage),\u201d and \u201cbusiness ties\u201d all favor a noncitizen seeking can-\ncellation), the Government contended that Barton was cat-\negorically ineligible for that relief. It reasoned that Bar-\nton\u2019s prior offenses triggered the stop-time rule and that\nBarton therefore could not meet the continuous-residence\nrequirement.\n  The problem (for the Government) was finding a prior of-\nfense that actually triggered the stop-time rule. None of the\noffenses that had made Barton deportable\u2014his firearms\nand drug convictions\u2014satisfied the stop-time rule\u2019s first\nclause because \u00a71182(a)(2) does not \u201crefe[r] to\u201d those of-\nfenses. The Government therefore could not argue that\nBarton\u2019s firearms and drug offenses ended Barton\u2019s period\nof continuous residence under the stop-time rule. As for\nBarton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense, it was not a ground for\ndeportability under \u00a71227(a) and therefore did not render\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

That is, although the Government could\nnot charge Barton with inadmissibility, it relied upon a\nground of inadmissibility to assert that Barton was not en-\ntitled to relief from removal.\n   The Immigration Judge agreed with the Government.\nThe judge made clear, however, that she would have\ngranted Barton\u2019s cancellation application had he satisfied\nthe continuous-residence requirement. The judge cited,\namong other things, Barton\u2019s strong family ties, including\nhis four young children who were all U. S. citizens. The\njudge concluded that because \u201chis last arrest was over 10\nyears ago,\u201d Barton \u201cis clearly rehabilitated.\u201d The judge also\nconcluded that Barton\u2019s family \u201crelies on him and would\nsuffer hardship if he were to be deported to Jamaica.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 36a.\n                             II\n  Barton makes two arguments to this Court. The Court\nfocuses on the first\u2014that the stop-time rule will \u201crende[r]\u201d\na noncitizen inadmissible only if the person is actually ad-\njudicated inadmissible based on the given offense. But\nwhether Barton is right on that score is irrelevant because\nBarton\u2019s second argument\u2014which the Court fails to grap-\nple with meaningfully\u2014is surely correct: At the very least,\nan offense cannot \u201crende[r]\u201d someone inadmissible unless\nthe Government can legally charge that noncitizen with a\nground of inadmissibility. That is, the stop-time rule is con-\nsistent with basic immigration law: A noncitizen who has\nalready been admitted, and is not seeking readmission, can-\nnot be charged with any ground of inadmissibility and thus\ncannot be deemed inadmissible.\n\f8                           BARTON v. BARR\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Because the stop-time rule uses the terms \u201cremovable\u201d\n(i.e., deportable) and \u201cinadmissible\u201d in the disjunctive, the\nCourt must analyze the rule against the INA\u2019s historic two-\ntrack backdrop. That context confirms that the term \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d cannot refer to a noncitizen who, like Barton, has\nalready been admitted and is not seeking readmission. In-\ndeed, the terms \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d are mutu-\nally exclusive in removal proceedings: A noncitizen can be\ndeemed either inadmissible or deportable, not both.\n\u00a71229a(e) (for the purposes of removal statute and\n\u00a71229b\u2014governing cancellation of removal\u2014a noncitizen is\n\u201cinadmissible under section 1182\u201d if \u201cnot admitted to the\nUnited States,\u201d and \u201cdeportable under section 1227\u201d if \u201cad-\nmitted to the United States\u201d). For the purposes of the stop-\ntime rule, a person is not \u201cinadmissible\u201d unless that person\nactually seeks admission, and thus is subject to charges of\ninadmissibility.\n   After all, if the provision applied to those who could hy-\npothetically be rendered inadmissible, it could have said so.\nFor example, the statute would have said that it applied\nwhen \u201cthe alien has committed an offense referred to in sec-\ntion 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d that either (2) \u201ccould render the\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or (3) could render the noncitizen\n\u201cremovable [i.e., deportable] from the United States under\nsection 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court seems to suggest that the stop-time rule\u2019s tense simply\n\nmirrors \u00a71182(a)(2). See ante, at 13\u201314. It is true that \u00a71182(a)(2)\nspeaks in the present tense, stating that a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible\u201d if\nshe has been \u201cconvicted of \u201d or \u201cadmits having committed\u201d certain of-\nfenses. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). But the Court\u2019s argument does not follow. Sec-\ntion 1182, by its terms, applies only to \u201c[c]lasses of aliens ineligible for\nvisas or admission.\u201d \u00a71182(a). Because the provision applies only to\nnoncitizens seeking admission, it is only natural that the clause uses the\npresent tense to describe when such a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d By\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

Were the stop-time rule agnostic to whether\nthe noncitizen actually seeks admission, then the rule\u2019s\nthird clause\u2014regarding deportability\u2014would be meaning-\nless. When a noncitizen is \u201cremovable\u201d\u2014i.e., deportable\u2014\nunder \u00a71227 for an offense \u201creferred to\u201d in \u00a71182(a)(2), he\nor she is also \u201cinadmissible\u201d for an offense \u201creferred to\u201d in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). The third clause has meaning only if inadmis-\nsibility and deportability apply, as they always have, to sep-\narate groups of noncitizens\u2014noncitizens seeking admission\non the one hand, and noncitizens already admitted on the\nother.\n   To be sure, there are limited exceptions to the general\nrule that questions of admissibility apply only to nonciti-\nzens seeking formal admission.

These pro-\nvisions, it argues, demonstrate that throughout the INA,\ninadmissibility is a status untethered to admission. But\nthese provisions, too, refer to noncitizens seeking adjust-\nment of status. \u00a71160(a)(1) (setting procedures for adjust-\nment of status of certain noncitizens); \u00a71255a(a) (same).3\nEven if the Government were correct that these statutes\ndeem a noncitizen inadmissible outside of an application for\nadmission, its argument would rise and fall on a few provi-\nsions within the expansive INA.4 In any event, neither of\nthese provisions is similar in structure and purpose to the\nstop-time rule. Neither refers to grounds of inadmissibility\nand grounds of deportability in tandem. What is more, nei-\nther appears to confer or deny relief exclusively in removal\nproceedings\u2014where the dichotomy between inadmissibility\nand deportability is most important.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Indeed, one of the provisions suggests that, outside the context in\n\nwhich a noncitizen seeks adjustment of status (and thus seeks construc-\ntive admission), a noncitizen\u2019s status can be terminated \u201conly upon a de-\ntermination . . . that the alien is deportable.\u201d \u00a71160(a)(3)(A).\n   4 The Government also notes that a noncitizen would be deportable\n\nwere she inadmissible at entry (or during adjustment of status) but er-\nroneously admitted (or allowed to adjust status).

Were inadmissibility a status un-\ntethered to admission, a noncitizen inadmissible at the time of entry\nwould always be inadmissible. But because a noncitizen who was al-\nready admitted cannot be adjudicated inadmissible, Congress made er-\nroneous admission a ground of deportability, not inadmissibility.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Other-\nwise, the statute would subject already-admitted nonciti-\nzens\u2014even those who are not deportable for any criminal\noffense\u2014to mandatory detention, simply because they oc-\ncupy the \u201cstatus\u201d of inadmissibility. This provision\u2019s struc-\nture is virtually the same as the stop-time rule: It refers to\ngrounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportability sep-\narately and applies to a noncitizen in removal proceedings.\n   Given the similar structure, the stop-time rule should be\nread the same as the mandatory-detention provision: to re-\nfer to adjudications that are possible rather than impossi-\nble. If a noncitizen seeking admission has committed a\ncrime under \u00a71182(a)(2) and is convicted of or admits to the\noffense, that offense \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause the noncitizen can be charged and found inadmis-\nsible based on that crime.

At various points the Court\nseems to ignore the rule\u2019s second and third clauses en-\ntirely\u2014clauses that, as mentioned above, distinguish be-\ntween grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportabil-\nity. The Court insists that the statute \u201coperates like\ntraditional criminal recidivist laws\u201d because it precludes\ncancellation of removal for a noncitizen who \u201chas committed\nan offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d Ante, at 2; see also ante, at 7, 8, n. 5,\n17.\n   Had Congress intended for commission of a crime in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) alone to trigger the stop-time rule, it would\nhave said so. In fact, it would have stopped at the rule\u2019s\nfirst clause, which (without more) states the Court\u2019s rule:\nthat the time of continuous residence stops whenever a\nnoncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in section\n1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1).\n   But that reading ignores the rest of what Congress wrote.\nCongress specified that it is not enough for a noncitizen to\ncommit a crime listed in \u00a71182(a)(2); that crime must also\n\u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible to the United States under\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or \u201cremovable from the\nUnited States under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this\ntitle.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1).

First, the Court claims, the clause\nmakes clear that \u201ccancellation of removal is precluded if an\nalien committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial\nseven years of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the\nconviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\u201d Ante, at\n9. Despite the emphasis the Court lays on this point, it is\nirrelevant to this case: Barton does not dispute that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by the date of commission of a\ncrime rather than a later date of conviction. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 9, n. 4. The question in this case is whether certain\noffenses can possibly render Barton inadmissible when he\ndoes not seek admission and has already been admitted\u2014\nregardless of whether one looks to the date of commission\nor the date of conviction of those offenses.5\n   Even if this question mattered and were properly before\nus, Congress could have made the same point\u2014that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by commission of a crime\u2014by\nomitting the second and third clauses entirely. It again\ncould have written what the Court, at various points, seems\nto wish it had written: The stop-time rule is triggered when-\never a noncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d The second and third\nclauses\u2014which refer to later events, when a noncitizen is\nactually \u201crender[ed]\u201d inadmissible or deportable\u2014make the\nCourt\u2019s aside less plausible, not more.\n   The Court next insists that the second clause makes clear\nthat the crime must \u201crende[r]\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissi-\nble\u201d\u2014which, in the Court\u2019s view, requires only that a\nnoncitizen admit the crime or be convicted of it.

It is also at odds with common sense. With virtually\nevery other provision of the INA, Congress granted prefer-\nential treatment to lawfully admitted noncitizens\u2014and\nmost of all to LPRs like Barton. But because of the Court\u2019s\nopinion today, noncitizens who were already admitted to\nthe country are treated, for the purposes of the stop-time\nrule, identically to those who were not\u2014despite Congress\u2019\nexpress references to inadmissibility and deportability.\nThe result is that, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, an im-\nmigration judge may not even consider whether Barton is\nentitled to cancellation of removal\u2014because of an offense\nthat Congress deemed too trivial to allow for Barton\u2019s re-\nmoval in the first instance. Because the Court\u2019s opinion\ndoes no justice to the INA, let alone to longtime LPRs like\nBarton, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Barton acknowledges that, even now, the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4)\n\n\u201cdoes little or no work\u201d for a separate reason: Noncitizens who are de-\nportable under that subsection are ineligible for cancellation of removal.\nBrief for Petitioner 33, n. 7. But, according to Barton, there are scenarios\nin which the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4) nevertheless \u201c \u2018may . . . not be a re-\ndundancy,\u2019 \u201d ibid., and perhaps for this reason, the Government does not\nfocus on this argument in its brief.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145888/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/105289/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/127916/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118447/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/618680/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/777938/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118452/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/96405/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/131159/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/104952/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2462772/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4529018/", "id": 4529018, "absolute_url": "/opinion/4748671/county-of-maui-v-hawaii-wildlife-fund/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/4748671/", "author": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/people/384/", "joined_by": [], "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "date_created": "2020-04-27T15:00:41.102389Z", "date_modified": "2020-04-27T15:20:24.483099Z", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "11ba70f06756f6d5995eb3818ccc2b26211f54b7", "page_count": 51, "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-260_jifl.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2020/04/23/county_of_maui_v._hawaii_wildlife_fund_1.pdf", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2019                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 6, 2019\u2014Decided April 23, 2020\nThe Clean Water Act forbids \u201cany addition\u201d of any pollutant from \u201cany\n  point source\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d without an appropriate permit\n  from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 502(12),\n  86 Stat. 844, 886. The Act defines \u201cpollutant\u201d broadly, \u00a7502(6); defines\n  a \u201cpoint source\u201d as \u201c \u2018any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance\n  . . . from which pollutants are or may be discharged,\u2019 \u201d including, e.g.,\n  any \u201c \u2018container,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018well,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(14); and defines the term \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d as \u201c \u2018any ad-\n  dition of any pollutant to navigable waters [including navigable\n  streams, rivers, the ocean, or coastal waters] from any point source,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(12). It then uses those terms in making \u201cunlawful\u201d \u201c \u2018the dis-\n  charge of any pollutant by any person\u2019 \u201d without an appropriate permit.\n  \u00a7301.\n      Petitioner County of Maui\u2019s wastewater reclamation facility collects\n  sewage from the surrounding area, partially treats it, and each day\n  pumps around 4 million gallons of treated water into the ground\n  through four wells. This effluent then travels about a half mile,\n  through groundwater, to the Pacific Ocean. Respondent environmen-\n  tal groups brought a citizens\u2019 Clean Water Act suit, alleging that Maui\n  was \u201cdischarg[ing]\u201d a \u201cpollutant\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d without the re-\n  quired permit. The District Court found that the discharge from\n  Maui\u2019s wells into the nearby groundwater was \u201cfunctionally one into\n  navigable water,\u201d 24 F. Supp. 3d 980, 998, and granted summary judg-\n  ment to the environmental groups. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, stat-\n  ing that a permit is required when \u201cpollutants are fairly traceable from\n  the point source to a navigable water.\u201d 886 F. 3d 737, 749.\nHeld: The statutory provisions at issue require a permit when there is a\n\f2           COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    direct discharge from a point source into navigable waters or when\n    there is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Pp. 4\u201318.\n       (a) Statutory context limits the reach of the phrase \u201cfrom any point\n    source\u201d to a range of circumstances narrower than that which the\n    Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d interpretation suggests. At the same\n    time, it is significantly broader than the total exclusion of all dis-\n    charges through groundwater, as urged by Maui and by the Solicitor\n    General as amicus curiae. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d limitation could allow EPA\n    to assert permitting authority over the release of pollutants that reach\n    navigable waters many years after their release. But Congress did not\n    intend to provide EPA with such broad authority. First, to interpret\n    \u201cfrom\u201d so broadly might require a permit in unexpected circumstances,\n    such as, e.g., the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250 miles of\n    groundwater to a river. Second, the statute\u2019s structure indicates that,\n    as to groundwater pollution and nonpoint source pollution, Congress\n    left substantial responsibility and autonomy to the States and did not\n    give EPA authority that could seriously interfere with this state re-\n    sponsibility. Third, the Act\u2019s legislative history strongly supports the\n    conclusion that the permitting provision does not extend so far. Fi-\n    nally, longstanding regulatory practice shows that EPA has success-\n    fully applied the permitting provision to pollution discharges from\n    point sources that reached navigable waters through groundwater\n    using a narrower interpretation than that of the Ninth Circuit. Pp. 5\u2013\n    10.\n       (c) Maui, the Government, and the two dissents argue for interpre-\n    tations that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purposes,\n    are also too extreme. Pp. 10\u201315.\n          (1) Maui and the Solicitor General argue that the statute\u2019s per-\n    mitting requirement does not apply if a pollutant, having emerged\n    from a \u201cpoint source,\u201d must travel through any amount of groundwater\n    before reaching navigable waters. That narrow interpretation would\n    risk serious interference with EPA\u2019s ability to regulate point source\n    discharges, and Congress would not have intended to create such a\n    large and obvious loophole in one of the Clean Water Act\u2019s key regula-\n    tory innovations. P. 10.\n          (2) Reading \u201cfrom\u201d in the phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d together\n    with \u201cconveyance\u201d in the point source definition \u201cany . . . conveyance,\u201d\n    Maui argues that the meaning of \u201cfrom any point source\u201d is not about\n    where the pollution originated, but about how it got there. Thus, Maui\n    claims, a permit is required only if a point source ultimately delivers\n    the pollutant to navigable waters. By contrast, if a pollutant travels\n    through groundwater, then the groundwater is the conveyance and no\n    permit is required. But Maui\u2019s definition of \u201cfrom\u201d as connoting a\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nmeans does not fit in context. Coupling \u201cfrom\u201d with \u201cto\u201d is strong evi-\ndence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnavigable wa-\nters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d). That Maui\u2019s reading would\ncreate a serious loophole in the permitting regime also indicates that\nit is unreasonable. Pp. 10\u201311.\n      (3) The Solicitor General argues that the proper interpretation of\nthe statute is the one reflected in EPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement,\nnamely, that \u201call releases of pollutants to groundwater\u201d are excluded\nfrom the scope of the permitting program, \u201ceven where pollutants are\nconveyed to jurisdictional surface waters via groundwater.\u201d 84 Fed.\nReg. 16810, 16811. That reading, which would open a loophole allow-\ning easy evasion of the statutory provision\u2019s basic purposes, is neither\npersuasive nor reasonable. EPA is correct that Congress did not re-\nquire a permit for all discharges to groundwater, and it did authorize\nstudy and funding related to groundwater pollution. But the most that\nthe study and funding provisions show is that Congress thought that\nthe problem of pollution in groundwater would primarily be addressed\nby the States or perhaps by other federal statutes. EPA\u2019s new inter-\npretation is also difficult to reconcile with the statute\u2019s reference to\n\u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable waters; with the statute\u2019s\ninclusion of \u201cwells\u201d in the \u201cpoint source\u201d definition, since wells would\nordinarily discharge pollutants through groundwater; and with statu-\ntory provisions that allow EPA to delegate its permitting authority to\na State only if the State, inter alia, provides \u201c \u2018adequate authority\u2019 \u201d to\n\u201c \u2018control the disposal of pollutants into wells,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7402(b). Pp. 11\u201313.\n      (4) Perhaps, as the dissents suggest, the statute\u2019s language could\nbe narrowed by reading the statute to refer only to the pollutant\u2019s im-\nmediate origin, but there is no linguistic basis for this limitation.\nPp. 13\u201315.\n    (d) The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim to provide federal\nregulation of identifiable sources of pollutants entering navigable wa-\nters without undermining the States\u2019 longstanding regulatory author-\nity over land and groundwater. The reading of the statute that best\ncaptures Congress\u2019 meaning, reflected in the statute\u2019s words, struc-\nture, and purposes, is that a permit is required when there is a dis-\ncharge from a point source directly into navigable waters or when\nthere is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Many factors\nmay be relevant to determining whether a particular discharge is the\nfunctional equivalent of one directly into navigable waters. Time and\ndistance will be the most important factors in most cases, but other\nrelevant factors may include, e.g., the nature of the material through\nwhich the pollutant travels and the extent to which the pollutant is\ndiluted or chemically changed as it travels. Courts will provide addi-\ntional guidance through decisions in individual cases. The underlying\n\f4           COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statutory objectives can also provide guidance, and EPA can provide\n    administrative guidance. Although this interpretation does not pre-\n    sent as clear a line as the other interpretations proffered, the EPA has\n    applied the permitting provision to some discharges through ground-\n    water for over 30 years, with no evidence of inadministrability or an\n    unmanageable expansion in the statute\u2019s scope.

We conclude that the statutory provisions at\nissue require a permit if the addition of the pollutants\nthrough groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct\ndischarge from the point source into navigable waters.\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                  I\n                                 A\n    Congress\u2019 purpose as reflected in the language of the\nClean Water Act is to \u201c \u2018restore and maintain the . . . integ-\nrity of the Nation\u2019s waters,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7101(a), 86 Stat. 816. Prior to\nthe Act, Federal and State Governments regulated water\npollution in large part by setting water quality standards.\nSee EPA v. California ex rel. State Water Resources Control\nBd., 426 U. S. 200, 202\u2013203 (1976). The Act restructures\nfederal regulation by insisting that a person wishing to dis-\ncharge any pollution into navigable waters first obtain\nEPA\u2019s permission to do so. See id., at 203\u2013205; Milwaukee\nv. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 310\u2013311 (1981).\n    The Act\u2019s provisions use specific definitional language to\nachieve this result. First, the Act defines \u201cpollutant\u201d\nbroadly, including in its definition, for example, any solid\nwaste, incinerator residue, \u201c \u2018heat,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018discarded equip-\nment,\u2019 \u201d or sand (among many other things). \u00a7502(6), 86\nStat. 886. Second, the Act defines a \u201cpoint source\u201d as \u201c \u2018any\ndiscernible, confined and discrete conveyance . . . from\nwhich pollutants are or may be discharged,\u2019 \u201d including, for\nexample, any \u201c \u2018container,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel,\nconduit,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018well.\u2019 \u201d \u00a7502(14), id., at 887. Third, it defines\nthe term \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d as \u201c \u2018any addition of any\npollutant to navigable waters [including navigable streams,\nrivers, the ocean, or coastal waters] from any point source.\u2019 \u201d\n\u00a7502(12), id., at 886.\n    The Act then sets forth a statutory provision that, using\nthese terms, broadly states that (with certain exceptions)\n\u201c \u2018the discharge of any pollutant by any person\u2019 \u201d without an\nappropriate permit \u201c \u2018shall be unlawful.\u2019 \u201d \u00a7301, id., at 844.\nThe question here, as we have said, is whether, or how, this\nstatutory language applies to a pollutant that reaches nav-\nigable waters only after it leaves a \u201cpoint source\u201d and then\ntravels through groundwater before reaching navigable wa-\nters. In such an instance, has there been a \u201cdischarge of a\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

The facility collects sewage from the surrounding\narea, partially treats it, and pumps the treated water\nthrough four wells hundreds of feet underground. This ef-\nfluent, amounting to about 4 million gallons each day, then\ntravels a further half mile or so, through groundwater, to\nthe ocean.\n   In 2012, several environmental groups, the respondents\nhere, brought this citizens\u2019 Clean Water Act lawsuit against\nMaui. See \u00a7505(a), id., at 888. They claimed that Maui was\n\u201cdischarg[ing]\u201d a \u201cpollutant\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d namely,\nthe Pacific Ocean, without the permit required by the Clean\nWater Act. The District Court, relying in part upon a de-\ntailed study of the discharges, found that a considerable\namount of effluent from the wells ended up in the ocean (a\nnavigable water). It wrote that, because the \u201cpath to the\nocean is clearly ascertainable,\u201d the discharge from Maui\u2019s\nwells into the nearby groundwater was \u201cfunctionally one\ninto navigable water.\u201d 24 F. Supp. 3d 980, 998 (Haw. 2014).\nAnd it granted summary judgment in favor of the environ-\nmental groups. See id., at 1005.\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court, but it de-\nscribed the relevant statutory standard somewhat differ-\nently. The appeals court wrote that a permit is required\nwhen \u201cthe pollutants are fairly traceable from the point\nsource to a navigable water such that the discharge is the\nfunctional equivalent of a discharge into the navigable wa-\nter.\u201d 886 F. 3d 737, 749 (2018) (emphasis added). The court\nleft \u201cfor another day the task of determining when, if ever,\nthe connection between a point source and a navigable wa-\nter is too tenuous to support liability . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n\f4        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Maui petitioned for certiorari. In light of the differences\nin the standards adopted by the different Courts of Appeals,\nwe granted the petition. Compare, e.g., 886 F. 3d, at 749\n(\u201cfairly traceable\u201d), with Upstate Forever v. Kinder Morgan\nEnergy Partners, L. P., 887 F. 3d 637, 651 (CA4 2018) (\u201cdi-\nrect hydrological connection\u201d), and Kentucky Waterways Al-\nliance v. Kentucky Util. Co., 905 F. 3d 925, 932\u2013938 (CA6\n2018) (discharges through groundwater are excluded from\nthe Act\u2019s permitting requirements).\n                               II\n   The linguistic question here concerns the statutory word\n\u201cfrom.\u201d Is pollution that reaches navigable waters only\nthrough groundwater pollution that is \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource, as the statute uses the word? The word \u201cfrom\u201d is\nbroad in scope, but context often imposes limitations. \u201cFin-\nland,\u201d for example, is often not the right kind of answer to\nthe question, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d even if long ago\nyou were born there.\n   The parties here disagree dramatically about the scope of\nthe word \u201cfrom\u201d in the present context. The environmental\ngroups, the respondents, basically adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nview\u2014that the permitting requirement applies so long as\nthe pollutant is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to a point source even if it\ntraveled long and far (through groundwater) before it\nreached navigable waters. They add that the release from\nthe point source must be \u201ca proximate cause of the addition\nof pollutants to navigable waters.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n20.\n   Maui, on the other hand, argues that the statute creates\na \u201cbright-line test.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 27\u201328.

A pollutant is \u201cfrom\u201d a\npoint source only if a point source is the last \u201cconveyance\u201d\nthat conducted the pollutant to navigable waters.\n  The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, supports Maui,\nat least in respect to groundwater. Reiterating the position\ntaken in a recent EPA \u201cInterpretive Statement,\u201d see 84 Fed.\nReg. 16810 (2019), he argues that, given the Act\u2019s structure\nand history, \u201ca release of pollutants to groundwater is not\nsubject to\u201d the Act\u2019s permitting requirement \u201ceven if the\npollutants subsequently migrate to jurisdictional surface\nwaters,\u201d such as the ocean. Brief for United States as Ami-\ncus Curiae 12 (capitalization omitted).\n  We agree that statutory context limits the reach of the\nstatutory phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d to a range of cir-\ncumstances narrower than that which the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation suggests. At the same time, it is signifi-\ncantly broader than the total exclusion of all discharges\nthrough groundwater described by Maui and the Solicitor\nGeneral.\n                              III\n   Virtually all water, polluted or not, eventually makes its\nway to navigable water. This is just as true for groundwa-\nter. See generally 2 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Encyclopedia\n2600 (10th ed. 2008) (defining \u201cHydrology\u201d). Given the\npower of modern science, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s limitation,\n\u201cfairly traceable,\u201d may well allow EPA to assert permitting\nauthority over the release of pollutants that reach naviga-\nble waters many years after their release (say, from a well\nor pipe or compost heap) and in highly diluted forms. See,\ne.g., Brief for Aquatic Scientists et al. as Amici Curiae\n13\u201328.\n   The respondents suggest that the standard can be nar-\nrowed by adding a \u201cproximate cause\u201d requirement. That is,\nto fall within the permitting provision, the discharge from\n\f6       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na point source must \u201cproximately cause\u201d the pollutants\u2019\neventual addition to navigable waters. But the term \u201cprox-\nimate cause\u201d derives from general tort law, and it takes on\nits specific content based primarily on \u201cpolicy\u201d considera-\ntions. See CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U. S. 685, 701\n(2011) (plurality opinion). In the context of water pollution,\nwe do not see how it significantly narrows the statute be-\nyond the words \u201cfairly traceable\u201d themselves.\n   Our view is that Congress did not intend the point source-\npermitting requirement to provide EPA with such broad au-\nthority as the Ninth Circuit\u2019s narrow focus on traceability\nwould allow. First, to interpret the word \u201cfrom\u201d in this lit-\neral way would require a permit in surprising, even bizarre,\ncircumstances, such as for pollutants carried to navigable\nwaters on a bird\u2019s feathers, or, to mention more mundane\ninstances, the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250\nmiles of groundwater to a river.\n   Second, and perhaps most important, the structure of the\nstatute indicates that, as to groundwater pollution and non-\npoint source pollution, Congress intended to leave substan-\ntial responsibility and autonomy to the States. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7101(b), 86 Stat. 816 (stating Congress\u2019 purpose in this re-\ngard). Much water pollution does not come from a readily\nidentifiable source. See 3 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Ency-\nclopedia, at 5801 (defining \u201cWater Pollution\u201d). Rainwater,\nfor example, can carry pollutants (say, as might otherwise\ncollect on a roadway); it can pollute groundwater, and pol-\nlution collected by unchanneled rainwater runoff is not or-\ndinarily considered point source pollution. Over many dec-\nades, and with federal encouragement, the States have\ndeveloped methods of regulating nonpoint source pollution\nthrough water quality standards, and otherwise. See, e.g.,\nNonpoint Source Program, Annual Report (California) 6\n(2016\u20132017) (discussing state timberland management pro-\ngrams to address addition of sediment-pollutants to navi-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Although the Act grants\nEPA specific authority to regulate certain point source pol-\nlution (it can also delegate some of this authority to the\nStates acting under EPA supervision, see \u00a7402(b), 86 Stat.\n880), these permitting provisions refer to \u201cpoint sources\u201d\nand \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d and say nothing at all about non-\npoint source regulation or groundwater regulation. We\nmust doubt that Congress intended to give EPA the author-\nity to apply the word \u201cfrom\u201d in a way that could interfere as\nseriously with States\u2019 traditional regulatory authority\u2014au-\nthority the Act preserves and promotes\u2014as the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d test would.\n   Third, those who look to legislative history to help inter-\npret a statute will find that this Act\u2019s history strongly\nsupports our conclusion that the permitting provision does not\nextend so far. Fifty years ago, when Congress was consid-\nering the bills that became the Clean Water Act, William\nRuckelshaus, the first EPA Administrator, asked Congress\nto grant EPA authority over \u201cground waters\u201d to \u201cassure that\n\f8        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have control over the water table . . . so we can . . . main-\ntai[n] a control over all the sources of pollution, be they dis-\ncharged directly into any stream or through the ground wa-\nter table.\u201d Water Pollution Control Legislation\u20131971\n(Proposed Amendments to Existing Legislation): Hearings\nbefore the House Committee on Public Works, 92d Cong.,\n1st Sess., 230 (1971). Representative Les Aspin similarly\npointed out that there were \u201cconspicuou[s ]\u201d references to\ngroundwater in all sections of the bill except the permitting\nsection at issue here. Water Pollution Control Legislation\u2013\n1971: Hearings before the House Committee on Public\nWorks on H. R. 11896 and H. R. 11895, 92d Cong., 1st Sess.,\n727 (1972). The Senate Committee on Public Works \u201crecog-\nnize[d] the essential link between ground and surface wa-\nters.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u2013414, p. 73 (1971).\n   But Congress did not accept these requests for general\nEPA authority over groundwater. It rejected Representa-\ntive Aspin\u2019s amendment that would have extended the per-\nmitting provision to groundwater. Instead, Congress pro-\nvided a set of more specific groundwater-related measures\nsuch as those requiring States to maintain \u201caffirmative con-\ntrols over the injection or placement in wells\u201d of \u201cany pollu-\ntants that may affect ground water.\u201d Ibid. These specific\nstate-related programs were, in the words of the Senate\nPublic Works Committee, \u201cdesigned to protect ground wa-\nters and eliminate the use of deep well disposal as an un-\ncontrolled alternative to toxic and pollution control.\u201d Ibid.\nThe upshot is that Congress was fully aware of the need to\naddress groundwater pollution, but it satisfied that need\nthrough a variety of state-specific controls. Congress left\ngeneral groundwater regulatory authority to the States; its\nfailure to include groundwater in the general EPA permit-\nting provision was deliberate.\n   Finally, longstanding regulatory practice undermines the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s broad interpretation of the statute. EPA it-\nself for many years has applied the permitting provision to\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npollution discharges from point sources that reached navi-\ngable waters only after traveling through groundwater.\nSee, e.g., United States Steel Corp. v. Train, 556 F. 2d 822,\n832 (CA7 1977) (permit for \u201cdeep waste-injection well\u201d on\nthe shore of navigable waters). But, in doing so, EPA fol-\nlowed a narrower interpretation than that of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit. See, e.g., In re Bethlehem Steel Corp., 2 E. A. D. 715,\n718 (EAB 1989) (Act\u2019s permitting requirement applies only\nto injection wells \u201cthat inject into ground water with a phys-\nically and temporally direct hydrologic connection to sur-\nface water\u201d). EPA has opposed applying the Act\u2019s permit-\nting requirements to discharges that reach groundwater\nonly after lengthy periods. See McClellan Ecological Seep-\nage Situation (MESS) v. Cheney, 763 F. Supp. 431, 437 (ED\nCal. 1989) (United States argued that permitting provisions\ndo not apply when it would take \u201cliterally dozens, and per-\nhaps hundreds, of years for any pollutants\u201d to reach navi-\ngable waters); Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Larson, 641\nF. Supp. 2d 1120, 1139 (Idaho 2009) (same in respect to in-\nstances where it would take \u201cbetween 60 and 420 years\u201d for\npollutants to travel \u201cone to four miles\u201d through groundwa-\nter before reaching navigable waters). Indeed, in this very\ncase (prior to its recent Interpretive Statement, see infra,\nat 12\u201313), EPA asked the Ninth Circuit to apply a more lim-\nited \u201cdirect hydrological connection\u201d test. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae in No. 15\u201317447 (CA9), pp.\n13\u201320. The Ninth Circuit did not accept this suggestion.\n   We do not defer here to EPA\u2019s interpretation of the stat-\nute embodied in this practice. Indeed, EPA itself has\nchanged its mind about the meaning of the statutory provi-\nsion. See infra, at 12\u201314. But this history, by showing that\na comparatively narrow view of the statute is administra-\ntively workable, offers some additional support for the view\nthat Congress did not intend as broad a delegation of regu-\nlatory authority as the Ninth Circuit test would allow.\n   As we have said, the specific meaning of the word \u201cfrom\u201d\n\f10        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessarily draws its meaning from context. The apparent\nbreadth of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d approach is\ninconsistent with the context we have just described.\n                              IV\n                               A\n  Maui and the Solicitor General argue that the statute\u2019s\npermitting requirement does not apply if a pollutant, hav-\ning emerged from a \u201cpoint source,\u201d must travel through any\namount of groundwater before reaching navigable waters.\nThat interpretation is too narrow, for it would risk serious\ninterference with EPA\u2019s ability to regulate ordinary point\nsource discharges.\n  Consider a pipe that spews pollution directly into coastal\nwaters. There is an \u201caddition of \u201d a \u201cpollutant to navigable\nwaters from [a] point source.\u201d Hence, a permit is required.\nBut Maui and the Government read the permitting require-\nment not to apply if there is any amount of groundwater\nbetween the end of the pipe and the edge of the navigable\nwater. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136, 24\u201325. If that is the correct\ninterpretation of the statute, then why could not the pipe\u2019s\nowner, seeking to avoid the permit requirement, simply\nmove the pipe back, perhaps only a few yards, so that the\npollution must travel through at least some groundwater\nbefore reaching the sea? Cf. Brief for State of Maryland et\nal. as Amici Curiae 9, n. 4. We do not see how Congress\ncould have intended to create such a large and obvious loop-\nhole in one of the key regulatory innovations of the Clean\nWater Act. Cf. California ex rel. State Water Resources Con-\ntrol Bd., 426 U. S., at 202\u2013204 (basic purpose of Clean Wa-\nter Act is to regulate pollution at its source); The Emily, 9\nWheat. 381, 390 (1824) (rejecting an interpretation that\nwould facilitate \u201cevasion of the law\u201d).\n                            B\n     Maui argues that the statute\u2019s language requires its\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreading. That language requires a permit for a \u201cdischarge.\u201d\nA \u201cdischarge\u201d is \u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable\nwaters \u201cfrom any point source.\u201d And a \u201cpoint source\u201d is \u201cany\ndiscernible, confined and discrete conveyance\u201d (such as a\npipe, ditch, well, etc.). Reading \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d to-\ngether, Maui argues that the statutory meaning of \u201cfrom\nany point source\u201d is not about where the pollution origi-\nnated, but about how it got there. Under what Maui calls\nthe means-of-delivery test, a permit is required only if a\npoint source itself ultimately delivers the pollutant to nav-\nigable waters. Under this view, if the pollutant must travel\nthrough groundwater to reach navigable waters, then it is\nthe groundwater, not the pipe, that is the conveyance.\n  Congress sometimes adopts less common meanings of\ncommon words, but this esoteric definition of \u201cfrom,\u201d as con-\nnoting a means, does not remotely fit in this context. The\nstatute couples the word \u201cfrom\u201d with the word \u201cto\u201d\u2014strong\nevidence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnav-\nigable waters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d). Further\nunderscoring that Congress intended this every day mean-\ning is that the object of \u201cfrom\u201d is a \u201cpoint source\u201d\u2014a source,\nagain, connoting an origin. That Maui\u2019s proffered interpre-\ntation would also create a serious loophole in the permitting\nregime also indicates it is an unreasonable one.\n                              C\n   The Solicitor General agrees that, as a general matter,\nthe permitting requirement applies to at least some addi-\ntions of pollutants to navigable waters that come indirectly\nfrom point sources. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 33\u201335. But the Solicitor General argues that the\nproper interpretation of the statute is the one reflected in\nEPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement. After receiving more\nthan 50,000 comments from the public, and after the Ninth\nCircuit released its opinion in this case, EPA wrote that\n\f12      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe best, if not the only, reading\u201d of the statutory provi-\nsions is that \u201call releases of pollutants to groundwater\u201d are\nexcluded from the scope of the permitting program, \u201ceven\nwhere pollutants are conveyed to jurisdictional surface wa-\nters via groundwater.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 16810, 16811.\n   Neither the Solicitor General nor any party has asked us\nto give what the Court has referred to as Chevron deference\nto EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute. See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 844 (1984). Even so, we often pay particular attention\nto an agency\u2019s views in light of the agency\u2019s expertise in a\ngiven area, its knowledge gained through practical experi-\nence, and its familiarity with the interpretive demands of\nadministrative need. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533\nU. S. 218, 234\u2013235 (2001); Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134, 139\u2013140 (1944). But here, as we have explained,\nto follow EPA\u2019s reading would open a loophole allowing easy\nevasion of the statutory provision\u2019s basic purposes. Such an\ninterpretation is neither persuasive nor reasonable.\n   EPA correctly points out that Congress did not require a\npermit for all discharges to groundwater; rather, Congress\nauthorized study and funding related to groundwater pol-\nlution. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15\u2013\n19. But there is quite a gap between \u201cnot all\u201d and \u201cnone.\u201d\nThe statutory text itself alludes to no exception for dis-\ncharges through groundwater. These separate provisions\nfor study and funding that EPA points to would be a \u201csur-\nprisingly indirect route\u201d to convey \u201can important and easily\nexpressed message\u201d\u2014that the permit requirement simply\ndoes not apply if the pollutants travel through groundwa-\nter. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 262\n(1994). In truth, the most these provisions show is that\nCongress thought that the problem of groundwater pollu-\ntion, as distinct from navigable water pollution, would pri-\nmarily be addressed by the States or perhaps by other fed-\neral statutes.\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   EPA\u2019s new interpretation is also difficult to reconcile with\nthe statute\u2019s reference to \u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to\nnavigable waters. Cf. Milwaukee, 451 U. S., at 318 (\u201cEvery\npoint source discharge is prohibited unless covered by a per-\nmit\u201d (footnote omitted)). It is difficult to reconcile EPA\u2019s in-\nterpretation with the statute\u2019s inclusion of \u201cwells\u201d in the\ndefinition of \u201cpoint source,\u201d for wells most ordinarily would\ndischarge pollutants through groundwater. And it is diffi-\ncult to reconcile EPA\u2019s interpretation with the statutory\nprovisions that allow EPA to delegate its permitting au-\nthority to a State only if the State (among other things) pro-\nvides \u201c \u2018adequate authority\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018control the disposal of pol-\nlutants into wells.\u2019 \u201d \u00a7402(b), 86 Stat. 881. What need\nwould there be for such a proviso if the federal permitting\nprogram the State replaces did not include such discharges\n(from wells through groundwater) in the first place?\n   In short, EPA\u2019s oblique argument about the statute\u2019s ref-\nerences to groundwater cannot overcome the statute\u2019s\nstructure, its purposes, or the text of the provisions that ac-\ntually govern.\n                               D\n   Perhaps, as the two dissents suggest, the language could\nbe narrowed to similar effect by reading the statute to refer\nonly to the pollutant\u2019s immediate origin. See post, at 2\u20133\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.); post, at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But\nthere is no linguistic basis here to so limit the statute in\nthat way. Again, whether that is the correct reading turns\non context. JUSTICE THOMAS insists that in the case of a\ndischarge through groundwater, the pollutants are added\n\u201cfrom the groundwater.\u201d Post, at 2. Indeed, but that does\nnot mean they are not also \u201cfrom the point source.\u201d Ibid.\nWhen John comes to the hotel, John might have come from\nthe train station, from Baltimore, from Europe, from any\ntwo of those three places, or from all three.

As\nthe plurality correctly noted in Rapanos v. United States,\n547 U. S. 715 (2006), the statute here does not say \u201cdirectly\u201d\nfrom or \u201cimmediately\u201d from. Id., at 743 (opinion of Scalia,\nJ.). Indeed, the expansive language of the provision\u2014any\naddition from any point source\u2014strongly suggests its scope\nis not so limited.\n   JUSTICE ALITO appears to believe that there are only two\npossible ways to read \u201cfrom\u201d: as referring either to the im-\nmediate source, or else to the original source. Post, at 5, 8.\nBecause he agrees that the statute cannot reasonably be\nread always to reach the original source, he concludes the\nstatute must refer only to the immediate origin. But as the\nforegoing example illustrates, context may indicate that\n\u201cfrom\u201d includes an intermediate stop\u2014Baltimore, not Eu-\nrope or the train station.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS relies on the word \u201caddition,\u201d but we fail\nto see how that word limits the statute to discharges di-\nrectly to navigable waters. Ordinary language abounds in\ncounter examples: A recipe might instruct to \u201cadd the drip-\npings from the meat to the gravy\u201d; that instruction does not\nbecome incomprehensible, or even peculiar, simply because\nthe drippings will have first collected in a pan or on a cut-\nting board. And while it would be an unusual phrasing (as\nstatutory phrasings often are), we do not see how the rec-\nipe\u2019s meaning would transform if it instead said to \u201cadd the\ndrippings to the gravy from the meat.\u201d To take another ex-\nample: If Timmy is told to \u201cadd water to the bath from the\nwell\u201d he will know just what it means\u2014even though he will\nhave to use a bucket to complete the task.\n   And although JUSTICE THOMAS resists the inevitable im-\nplications of his reading of the statute, post, at 5\u20136, that\nreading would create the same loopholes as those offered by\nthe petitioner and the Government, and more. It would nec-\nessarily exclude a pipe that drains onto the beach next to\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnavigable waters, even if the pollutants then flow to those\nwaters. It also seems to exclude a pipe that hangs out over\nthe water and adds pollutants to the air, through which the\npollutants fall to navigable waters. The absurdity of such\nan interpretation is obvious enough.\n  We therefore reject this reading as well: Like Maui\u2019s and\nthe Government\u2019s, it is inconsistent with the statutory text\nand simultaneously creates a massive loophole in the per-\nmitting scheme that Congress established.\n                              E\n  For the reasons set forth in Part III and in this Part, we\nconclude that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure,\nand purposes, the interpretations offered by the parties, the\nGovernment, and the dissents are too extreme.\n                              V\n  Over the years, courts and EPA have tried to find general\nlanguage that will reflect a middle ground between these\nextremes. The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim\nto provide federal regulation of identifiable sources of pol-\nlutants entering navigable waters without undermining the\nStates\u2019 longstanding regulatory authority over land and\ngroundwater. We hold that the statute requires a permit\nwhen there is a direct discharge from a point source into\nnavigable waters or when there is the functional equivalent\nof a direct discharge. We think this phrase best captures,\nin broad terms, those circumstances in which Congress in-\ntended to require a federal permit. That is, an addition falls\nwithin the statutory requirement that it be \u201cfrom any point\nsource\u201d when a point source directly deposits pollutants\ninto navigable waters, or when the discharge reaches the\nsame result through roughly similar means.\n  Time and distance are obviously important. Where a pipe\nends a few feet from navigable waters and the pipe emits\npollutants that travel those few feet through groundwater\n\f16      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(or over the beach), the permitting requirement clearly ap-\nplies. If the pipe ends 50 miles from navigable waters and\nthe pipe emits pollutants that travel with groundwater, mix\nwith much other material, and end up in navigable waters\nonly many years later, the permitting requirements likely\ndo not apply.\n   The object in a given scenario will be to advance, in a\nmanner consistent with the statute\u2019s language, the statu-\ntory purposes that Congress sought to achieve. As we have\nsaid (repeatedly), the word \u201cfrom\u201d seeks a \u201cpoint source\u201d\norigin, and context imposes natural limits as to when a\npoint source can properly be considered the origin of pollu-\ntion that travels through groundwater. That context in-\ncludes the need, reflected in the statute, to preserve state\nregulation of groundwater and other nonpoint sources of\npollution. Whether pollutants that arrive at navigable wa-\nters after traveling through groundwater are \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource depends upon how similar to (or different from) the\nparticular discharge is to a direct discharge.\n   The difficulty with this approach, we recognize, is that it\ndoes not, on its own, clearly explain how to deal with middle\ninstances. But there are too many potentially relevant fac-\ntors applicable to factually different cases for this Court\nnow to use more specific language. Consider, for example,\njust some of the factors that may prove relevant (depending\nupon the circumstances of a particular case): (1) transit\ntime, (2) distance traveled, (3) the nature of the material\nthrough which the pollutant travels, (4) the extent to which\nthe pollutant is diluted or chemically changed as it travels,\n(5) the amount of pollutant entering the navigable waters\nrelative to the amount of the pollutant that leaves the point\nsource, (6) the manner by or area in which the pollutant\nenters the navigable waters, (7) the degree to which the pol-\nlution (at that point) has maintained its specific identity.\nTime and distance will be the most important factors in\nmost cases, but not necessarily every case.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, courts can provide guidance through\ndecisions in individual cases. The Circuits have tried to do\nso, often using general language somewhat similar to the\nlanguage we have used. And the traditional common-law\nmethod, making decisions that provide examples that in\nturn lead to ever more refined principles, is sometimes use-\nful, even in an era of statutes.\n   The underlying statutory objectives also provide guid-\nance. Decisions should not create serious risks either of un-\ndermining state regulation of groundwater or of creating\nloopholes that undermine the statute\u2019s basic federal regu-\nlatory objectives.\n   EPA, too, can provide administrative guidance (within\nstatutory boundaries) in numerous ways, including\nthrough, for example, grants of individual permits, promul-\ngation of general permits, or the development of general\nrules. Indeed, over the years, EPA and the States have of-\nten considered the Act\u2019s application to discharges through\ngroundwater.\n   Both Maui and the Government object that to subject dis-\ncharges to navigable waters through groundwater to the\nstatute\u2019s permitting requirements, as our interpretation\nwill sometimes do, would vastly expand the scope of the\nstatute, perhaps requiring permits for each of the 650,000\nwells like petitioner\u2019s or for each of the over 20 million sep-\ntic systems used in many Americans\u2019 homes. Brief for Pe-\ntitioner 44\u201348; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n24\u201325. Cf. Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S.\n302, 324 (2014).\n   But EPA has applied the permitting provision to some\n(but not to all) discharges through groundwater for over 30\nyears. See supra, at 8\u20139. In that time we have seen no\nevidence of unmanageable expansion. EPA and the States\nalso have tools to mitigate those harms, should they arise,\nby (for example) developing general permits for recurring\nsituations or by issuing permits based on best practices\n\f18      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhere appropriate. See, e.g., 40 CFR \u00a7122.44(k) (2019).\nJudges, too, can mitigate any hardship or injustice when\nthey apply the statute\u2019s penalty provision. That provision\nvests courts with broad discretion to set a penalty that\ntakes account of many factors, including \u201cany good-faith ef-\nforts to comply\u201d with the Act, the \u201cseriousness of the viola-\ntion,\u201d the \u201ceconomic impact of the penalty on the violator,\u201d\nand \u201csuch other matters as justice may require.\u201d See 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71319(d). We expect that district judges will exer-\ncise their discretion mindful, as we are, of the complexities\ninherent to the context of indirect discharges through\ngroundwater, so as to calibrate the Act\u2019s penalties when, for\nexample, a party could reasonably have thought that a per-\nmit was not required.\n   In sum, we recognize that a more absolute position, such\nas the means-of-delivery test or that of the Government or\nthat of the Ninth Circuit, may be easier to administer. But,\nas we have said, those positions have consequences that are\ninconsistent with major congressional objectives, as re-\nvealed by the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purposes.\nWe consequently understand the permitting requirement,\n\u00a7301, as applicable to a discharge (from a point source) of\npollutants that reach navigable waters after traveling\nthrough groundwater if that discharge is the functional\nequivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into\nnavigable waters.\n                            VI\n  Because the Ninth Circuit applied a different standard,\nwe vacate its judgment and remand the case for further pro-\nceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

I write separately to\nemphasize three points.\n   First, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act\nregarding pollution \u201cfrom\u201d point sources adheres to the in-\nterpretation set forth in Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in\nRapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006). The Clean\nWater Act requires a permit for \u201cany addition of any pollu-\ntant to navigable waters from any point source.\u201d 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71362(12)(A); see \u00a7\u00a71311(a), 1342(a). The key word is\n\u201cfrom.\u201d The question in this case is whether the County of\nMaui needs a permit for its Lahaina Wastewater Reclama-\ntion Facility. No one disputes that pollutants originated at\nMaui\u2019s wastewater facility (a point source), and no one dis-\nputes that the pollutants ended up in the Pacific Ocean (a\nnavigable water). Maui contends, however, that it does not\nneed a permit. Maui says that the pollutants did not come\n\u201cfrom\u201d the Lahaina facility because the pollutants traveled\nthrough groundwater before reaching the ocean.\n   Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in Rapanos explained\nwhy Maui\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is incor-\nrect. In that case, Justice Scalia stated that polluters could\nnot \u201cevade the permitting requirement of \u00a71342(a) simply\nby discharging their pollutants into noncovered intermit-\ntent watercourses that lie upstream of covered waters.\u201d 547\n\f2       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nU. S., at 742\u2013743. Justice Scalia reasoned that the Clean\nWater Act does not merely \u201cforbid the \u2018addition of any pol-\nlutant directly to navigable waters from any point source,\u2019\nbut rather the \u2018addition of any pollutant to navigable wa-\nters.\u2019 Thus, from the time of the CWA\u2019s enactment, lower\ncourts have held that the discharge into intermittent chan-\nnels of any pollutant that naturally washes downstream\nlikely violates \u00a71311(a), even if the pollutants discharged\nfrom a point source do not emit \u2018directly into\u2019 covered wa-\nters, but pass \u2018through conveyances\u2019 in between.\u201d Id., at 743\n(citations omitted).\n   In other words, under Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation in\nRapanos, the fact that the pollutants from Maui\u2019s\nwastewater facility reach the ocean via an indirect route\ndoes not itself exempt Maui\u2019s facility from the Clean Water\nAct\u2019s permitting requirement for point sources. The Court\ntoday adheres to Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis in Rapanos on\nthat issue.\n   Second, as Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Rapanos pointed\nout and as the Court\u2019s opinion today explains, the statute\ndoes not establish a bright-line test regarding when a pol-\nlutant may be considered to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource. The source of the vagueness is Congress\u2019 statutory\ntext, not the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court\u2019s opinion seeks to\ntranslate the vague statutory text into more concrete\nguidance.\n   Third, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent states that \u201cthe Court\ndoes not commit\u201d to \u201cwhich factors are the most important\u201d\nin determining whether pollutants that enter navigable wa-\nters come \u201cfrom\u201d a point source. Post, at 5. That critique is\nnot accurate, as I read the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court iden-\ntifies relevant factors to consider and emphasizes that\n\u201c[t]ime and distance are obviously important.\u201d Ante, at 15.\nAnd the Court expressly adds that \u201c[t]ime and distance will\nbe the most important factors in most cases, but not neces-\nsarily every case.\u201d Ante, at 16.

S. C.\n\u00a71311(a); see \u00a71342. The CWA defines a \u201cdischarge\u201d as \u201cany\naddition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any\npoint source.\u201d \u00a71362(12).1 Based on the statutory text and\nstructure, I would hold that a permit is required only when\na point source discharges pollutants directly into navigable\nwaters. The Court adopts this interpretation in part, con-\ncluding that a permit is required for \u201ca direct discharge.\u201d\nAnte, at 15. But the Court then departs from the statutory\ntext by requiring a permit for \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge,\u201d ibid., which it defines through an open-\nended inquiry into congressional intent and practical con-\nsiderations. Because I would adhere to the text, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The CWA defines \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as \u201cthe waters of the United\n\nStates, including the territorial seas.\u201d \u00a71362(7). It defines a \u201cpoint\nsource\u201d as \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including\nbut not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete\nfissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation,\nor vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be dis-\ncharged,\u201d excluding \u201cagricultural stormwater discharges and return\nflows from irrigated agriculture.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               I\n                               A\n   In interpreting the statutory definition of \u201cdischarge,\u201d the\nCourt focuses on the word \u201cfrom,\u201d but the most helpful word\nis \u201caddition.\u201d That word, together with \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfrom,\u201d\nlimits the meaning of \u201cdischarge\u201d to the augmentation of\nnavigable waters.\n   Dictionary definitions of \u201caddition\u201d denote an augmenta-\ntion or increase. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary defines \u201caddition\u201d as \u201cthe act or process of adding:\nthe joining or uniting of one thing to another.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 24 (1961); see also ibid.\n(listing \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201caugmentation\u201d as synonyms for \u201cad-\ndition\u201d). Other dictionary definitions from around the time\nof the statute\u2019s enactment are in accord. See, e.g., American\nHeritage Dictionary 14, 15 (1981) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he act or process of adding\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as \u201c[t]o\njoin or unite so as to increase in size, quantity, or scope\u201d);\nsee also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 29, 30 (2d\ned. 1957) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as the \u201c[a]ct, process, or in-\nstance of adding,\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as to \u201cjoin or unite, as\none thing to another, or as several particulars, so as to in-\ncrease the number, augment the quantity, enlarge the mag-\nnitude, or so as to form into one aggregate\u201d).\n   The inclusion of the term \u201caddition\u201d in the CWA indicates\nthat the statute excludes anything other than a direct dis-\ncharge. When a point source releases pollutants to ground-\nwater, one would naturally say that the groundwater has\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. If\nthe pollutants eventually reach navigable waters, one\nwould not naturally say that the navigable waters have\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. The\naugmentation instead occurs with pollutants from the\ngroundwater.\n   The prepositions \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d reinforce this reading.\nWhen pollutants are released from a point source to another\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npoint source or groundwater, they are added to the second\nfrom the first. If the pollutants are later released to navi-\ngable waters, they are added to the navigable waters from\nthe second point source or the groundwater. One would not\nnaturally say that the pollutants are added to the navigable\nwaters from the original point source.\n   Interpreting \u201cdischarge\u201d to mean a direct discharge\nmakes sense of other parts of the definition as well. It re-\nspects the statutory definition of a point source as a \u201ccon-\nveyance,\u201d see \u00a71362(14), because a point source that re-\nleases pollutants directly into navigable waters is a means\nof conveyance. And it makes sense of the word \u201cany\u201d before\n\u201cpoint source,\u201d because that term clarifies that any kind of\npoint source may require a permit.\n   The structure of the CWA confirms this interpretation. It\nauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to\nregulate discharges from point sources, including through\nthe permitting process, but it reserves to the States the pri-\nmary responsibility for regulating other sources of pollu-\ntion, including groundwater. With respect to these sources,\nthe EPA merely collects information, coordinates with the\nStates, and provides funding. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71252(a),\n1254(a)(5), 1282(b)(2), 1288, 1314(a), 1329; ante, at 6\u20137. In\nthe CWA, Congress expressly stated its \u201cpolicy . . . to recog-\nnize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and\nrights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution.\u201d\n\u00a71251(b). Thus, construing the EPA\u2019s power to regulate\npoint sources to allow the agency to regulate nonpoint\nsources and groundwater is in serious tension with Con-\ngress\u2019 design.\n   My reading is also consistent with our decision in South\nFla. Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, 541 U. S.\n95 (2004). The petitioner in that case argued that no permit\nwas required when a point source was not the original\nsource of the pollutant but instead conveyed the pollutant\nfrom further up a chain of sources. Id., at 104. We rejected\n\f4        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat argument because \u201ca point source need not be the orig-\ninal source of the pollutant; it need only convey the pollu-\ntant to \u2018navigable waters.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 105. Although that case\ndid not involve the exact question presented here, the\ndirect-discharge interpretation comports well with that\nprevious decision.\n                                B\n   The Court\u2019s main textual argument reads the word\n\u201cfrom\u201d in isolation. But as the Court recognizes, \u201cthe word\n\u2018from\u2019 necessarily draws its meaning from context.\u201d Ante,\nat 9\u201310. The Court\u2019s example using \u201carrive\u201d instead of \u201cad-\ndition\u201d is thus unpersuasive, ante, at 13\u201314, because \u201cfrom\u201d\ntakes different meanings with different verbs. The Court\u2019s\nculinary example also misses the mark, ante, at 14, because\nif the drippings from the meat collect in the pan before the\nchef adds them to the gravy, the drippings are added to the\ngravy from the pan, not from the meat. This point becomes\nclear if we reorder the majority\u2019s recipe to match the stat-\nute; the chef has not added the drippings to the gravy from\nthe meat. The Court\u2019s bathwater example, ante, at 14, suf-\nfers from the same problem; if the well water is put in a\nbucket before it is put in the bathtub, it is added to the bath-\ntub from the bucket. Only by reading the phrase in its en-\ntirety can we interpret the definition of \u201cdischarge.\u201d See\nDeal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132 (1993).\n   The Court also asserts that a narrower reading than the\none it adopts would create a \u201cmassive loophole\u201d in the stat-\nute. Ante, at 15. Far from creating a loophole, my reading\nis the most logical because it is consonant with the scope of\nCongress\u2019 power. The CWA presumably was passed as an\nexercise of Congress\u2019 authority \u201cto regulate Commerce with\nforeign Nations, and among the several States, and with\nthe Indian Tribes.\u201d U. S.

It ultimately does little to explain how function-\nally equivalent an indirect discharge must be to require a\npermit.2\n   The Court suggests that the EPA could clarify matters\nthrough \u201cadministrative guidance,\u201d ante, at 17, but so far\nthe EPA has provided only limited advice and recently\nshifted its position, see 84 Fed. Reg. 16810 (2019); ante, at\n11\u201312. In any event, the sort of \u201c \u2018general rules\u2019 \u201d that the\nCourt hopes the EPA will promulgate are constitutionally\nsuspect. See Department of Transportation v. Association\nof American Railroads, 575 U. S. 43, 67\u201387 (2015)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Despite giving minimal guidance as to how this case\nshould be decided on remand, the majority speculates about\nwhether a permit would be required in other factual circum-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH believes that the Court\u2019s opinion provides\n\nenough guidance when it states that \u201c[t]ime and distance will be the most\nimportant factors in most cases, but not necessarily every case,\u201d ante, at\n16 (majority opinion) (emphasis added). See ante, at 2 (concurring opin-\nion). His hope for guidance appears misplaced. For all we know, these\nfactors may not be the most important in 49 percent of cases. The ma-\njority\u2019s nonexhaustive seven-factor test \u201cmay aid in identifying relevant\nfacts for analysis, but\u2014like most multifactor tests\u2014it leaves courts\nadrift once those facts have been identified.\u201d Dietz v.

It poses the examples of a pipe that releases pol-\nlutants over navigable waters and a pipe that releases pol-\nlutants onto land near navigable waters. As an initial mat-\nter, I am not as sure as the majority that a \u201cpollutant,\u201d as\ndefined by the CWA, may be added to the air.3 Even if the\nmajority is correct that a permit is not required in these\nhypothetical cases, drawing the line at discharges to water\nis not so absurd as to undermine the most natural reading\nof the statute. In any event, it is unnecessary to decide\nthese hypothetical cases today.\n   Finally, the Court speculates as to \u201cthose circumstances\nin which Congress intended to require a federal permit.\u201d\nAnte, at 15. But we are not a superlegislature (or super-\nEPA) tasked with making good policy\u2014assuming that is\neven what the Court accomplishes today. \u201cOur job is to fol-\nlow the text even if doing so will supposedly undercut a\nbasic objective of the statute.\u201d Baker Botts L.

First, the\ninterpretation adopted by respondents and the Ninth Cir-\ncuit is unsupportable. That interpretation\u2014which would\nrequire permits for discharges that are \u201c \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 \u201d\nto, and proximately caused by, a point source\u2014is atextual\nand unsettles the CWA\u2019s careful balance between federal\nregulation of point-source pollution and state regulation of\nnonpoint-source pollution. Ante, at 5\u20139.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The CWA defines a \u201cpollutant\u201d as \u201cdredged spoil, solid waste, incin-\n\nerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical\nwastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or dis-\ncarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, and\nagricultural waste discharged into water,\u201d with certain exceptions.\n\u00a71362(6).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Petitioner\u2019s and JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s interpretation also\ngives insufficient weight to the meaning of \u201caddition,\u201d see\nsupra, at 2.\n   Third, I agree that the EPA\u2019s interpretation is not enti-\ntled to deference for at least two reasons: No party requests\nit, and the EPA\u2019s reading is not the best one. Ante, at 12\u2013\n13. I add only that deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837\n(1984), likely conflicts with the Vesting Clauses of the Con-\nstitution. See Baldwin v. United States, 589 U.

S. 715 (2006), does not re-\nsolve this case. That plurality opinion, which I joined, ob-\nserved that lower courts have required a permit when pol-\nlutants pass through a chain of point sources. Id., at 743\u2013\n744. But we expressly said in Rapanos that \u201cwe [did] not\ndecide this issue.\u201d Id., at 743. We are not bound by dictum\nin a plurality opinion or by the lower court opinions it cited.\n                              III\n  The best reading of the statute is that a \u201cdischarge\u201d is the\nrelease of pollutants directly from a point source to naviga-\nble waters.

Here, however, the Court makes up a rule\nthat provides no clear guidance and invites arbitrary and\ninconsistent application.\n  The text of the Clean Water Act generally requires a per-\nmit when a discharge \u201cfrom\u201d a \u201cpoint source\u201d (such as a\npipe) \u201cadd[s]\u201d a pollutant \u201cto\u201d navigable waters (such as the\nPacific Ocean). 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(12). There are two ways\nto read this text. A pollutant that reaches the ocean could\nbe understood to have been added \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if the\npipe originally discharged the pollutant and the pollutant\neventually made its way to the ocean by flowing over or un-\nder the surface of the ground. Or a pollutant that reaches\nthe ocean could be understood to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if\nthe pollutant is discharged from the pipe directly into the\nocean.\n  There is no comprehensible alternative to these two\ninterpretations, but the Court refuses to accept either.\nBoth alternatives, it believes, lead to unacceptable results,\nand it therefore tries to find a middle way. It holds that a\npermit is required \u201cwhen there is a direct discharge from a\npoint source into navigable waters or when there is the\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfunctional equivalent of a direct discharge.\u201d Ante, at 15.\nThis is not a plausible interpretation of the statutory text\nand, to make matters worse, the Court\u2019s test has no clear\nmeaning.\n   Just what is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a \u201cdirect dis-\ncharge\u201d? The Court provides no real answer. All it will say\nis that the distance a pollutant travels and the time this\ntrip entails are the most important factors, but at least five\nother factors may have a bearing on the question, and even\nthis list is not exhaustive. Ante, at 16. Entities like water\ntreatment authorities that need to know whether they must\nget a permit are left to guess how this nebulous standard\nwill be applied. Regulators are given the discretion, at least\nin the first instance, to make of this standard what they\nwill. And the lower courts? The Court\u2019s advice, in essence,\nis: \u201cThat\u2019s your problem. Muddle through as best you can.\u201d\n                               I\n  Petitioner, the County of Maui (County), built the\nLahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility in the 1970s.\nExcerpts of Record 304. The facility receives sewage and\nthen discharges treated wastewater into wells (essentially\nlong pipes) that extend 200 feet or more below ground level.\nId., at 694\u2013695. Some of this discharge enters an aquifer\nbelow the facility. Id., at 696.\n  In all the years of its operation, the facility has never had\na National Pollution Discharge Elimination System\n(NPDES) permit for discharges from the wells, a fact that\nhas been well known to both the EPA and the Hawaii De-\npartment of Health (HDOH). The EPA helped to finance\nthe construction of the facility with a Clean Water Act\ngrant. Id., at 141. In 1973, before breaking ground on the\nfacility, the County prepared an environmental impact re-\nport and shared it with the EPA and the HDOH. Id., at\n140, 342. The report predicted that effluent injected into\ngroundwater from the wells would \u201ceventually reach the\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

Both the\nEPA and the HDOH received and submitted comments on\nthe report without any mention of a need for permitting dis-\ncharges from the wells. Id., at 140. Six years later, the\nHDOH issued an NPDES permit to the facility\u2014but not for\nthe wells. (The permit covered separate discharges to the\nHonokowai Stream.) Id., at 141, 223\u2013224. And in a May\n1985 NPDES Compliance Monitoring Report, the EPA con-\ncluded that the County was operating in compliance with\nthe permit, because all effluent was entering the injection\nwells\u2014and was thus destined for groundwater rather than\nfor navigable waters or for use in irrigation. Id., at 141,\n222. In 1994, HDOH again informed the EPA that \u201call ex-\nperts agree that the wastewater does enter the ocean.\u201d Id.,\nat 369. And again\u2014nothing from the federal authorities.\n   Thus, despite nearly five decades of notice that effluent\nfrom the facility would make, or was making, its way via\ngroundwater to the ocean, neither the EPA nor the HDOH\nrequired NPDES permitting for the Lahaina wells. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 138, 143. Indeed, none of the more than 6,600\nunderground injection wells in Hawaii currently has an\nNPDES permit.1\n   In 2012, however, as the Court recounts, respondents\nfiled a citizen suit claiming that the Lahaina facility was\nviolating the Clean Water Act by discharging pollutants\ninto the ocean without a permit. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment against the County on the issue of lia-\nbility because pollutants \u201ccan be directly traced from the\ninjection wells to the ocean.\u201d 24 F.

Under that agreement, the County must: make\ngood-faith efforts to obtain and comply with an NPDES per-\nmit; pay $100,000 in civil penalties; spend $2.5 million on a\n\u201csupplemental environmental project\u201d in the western part\nof the island of Maui; and pay nearly $1 million for respond-\nents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and other costs of litigation.2\n   On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the ground that\npollutants that eventually reached the ocean were \u201cfairly\ntraceable\u201d to the wells. 886 F. 3d 737, 749 (2018). We\ngranted review and must now decide whether the Court of\nAppeals erred in holding that the discharge of effluent from\nthe wells into groundwater requires a permit.\n                            II\n  The Clean Water Act generally makes it unlawful to \u201cdis-\ncharge\u201d a \u201cpollutant\u201d3 without a permit. 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71311(a). The Act defines the \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d as\n\u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters[4 ] from\nany point source.\u201d \u00a71362(12).

The term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d\nhas a well-known meaning, but the broader term \u201cwaters of the United\nStates\u201d is not defined by the Clean Water Act and has presented a diffi-\ncult issue for this Court. See Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715\n(2006). The EPA\u2019s definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d expressly\nexcludes groundwater, see 40 CFR \u00a7122.2 (2019); 84 Fed. Reg. 4190\n(2019), and no party in this case disputes that interpretation.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

The Act includes a non-exhaustive\nlist of conveyances that fall within this definition, and in-\ncluded on that list are such things as \u201cpipe[s],\u201d \u201cditch[es],\u201d\n\u201cchannel[s],\u201d and \u201cwell[s].\u201d Ibid.\n   Putting all these statutory terms together, the rule can\nbe stated as follows: A permit is required when a pollutant\nis \u201cadd[ed]\u201d to navigable waters \u201cfrom\u201d a \u201cpoint source.\u201d In\nthis case, the parties and the EPA agree that most of\nthe elements of this rule are met. Specifically, they agree\nthat: The effluent emitted by the wells is a \u201cpollutant\u201d; this\neffluent reaches navigable waters (the Pacific Ocean); and\nthe wells are \u201cpoint source[s].\u201d The disputed question is\nwhether the emission of effluent from those wells qualifies\nas a \u201cdischarge,\u201d that is, the addition of a pollutant \u201cfrom\u201d\na point source. \u00a71362(12) (emphasis added).\n   There are two possible interpretations of this phrase.\nThe first is that pollutants are added to navigable waters\nfrom a point source whenever they originally came from the\npoint source. The second is that pollutants are added to\nnavigable waters only if they were discharged from a point\nsource directly into navigable waters.\n   Dissatisfied with those options, the Court tries to find a\nthird, but its interpretation is very hard to fit into the stat-\nutory text. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, it appears\nthat a pollutant that leaves a point source and heads to-\nward navigable waters via some non-point source (such as\nby flowing over the ground or by means of groundwater) is\n\u201cfrom\u201d the point source for some portion of its journey, but\nonce it has travelled a certain distance or once a certain\namount of time has elapsed, it is no longer \u201cfrom\u201d the point\nsource and is instead \u201cfrom\u201d a non-point source.\n   This is an implausible reading of the statute. The Court\nhas many inventive examples of the different meanings\nthat can be conveyed by the simple statement that A comes\nfrom B, but one of the Court\u2019s examples\u2014the traveler who\n\f6       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nflies from Europe to Baltimore\u2014illustrates the problem. If\nwe apply the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71362 to this trav-\neler\u2019s journey, he would be \u201cfrom\u201d Europe for the first part\nof the flight, but at some point he might cease to be \u201cfrom\u201d\nEurope and would then be from someplace else, maybe\nGreenland or geographical coordinates in the middle of the\nAtlantic. This is a very strange notion, and therefore, I\nthink the statutory text compels us to choose between the\ntwo alternatives set out above.\n   The Court rejects both of these because it thinks they lead\nto unacceptably extreme results. \u201cOriginally from\u201d would\nimpose liability even if pollutants discharged into ground\nwater had to travel 250 miles over the course of 100 years\nbefore reaching navigable waters. See ante, at 6. And \u201c \u2018im-\nmediately\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018directly\u2019 from,\u201d the Court thinks, would\nmean that a polluter could evade the permit requirement\nby discharging pollutants from a pipe located just a few feet\nfrom navigable waters. Ante, at 14\u201315.\n   To escape these possibilities, the Court devises its own\ntest: A permit is required, the Court holds, \u201cwhen there is a\ndirect discharge from a point source into navigable waters\nor when there is the functional equivalent of a direct dis-\ncharge.\u201d Ante, at 15 (emphasis in original). The Clean Wa-\nter Act, however, says nothing about \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent\u201d of a direct discharge. That is the Court\u2019s own\nconcoction, and the Court provides no clear explanation of\nits meaning.\n   The term \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d may have a quasi-\ntechnical ring, but what does it mean? \u201cEquivalent\u201d means\n\u201cequal\u201d in some respect, and \u201cfunctional\u201d signifies a rela-\ntionship to a function. The function of a direct discharge\nfrom a point source into navigable waters is to convey the\nentirety of the discharge into navigable waters without any\ndelay. Therefore, the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a direct dis-\ncharge of a pollutant into navigable waters would seem to\nbe a discharge that is equal to a direct discharge in these\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrespects.\n   If that is what the Court meant by \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent of a direct discharge,\u201d the test would apply at best to\nonly a small set of situations not involving a direct dis-\ncharge. The Court\u2019s example of a pipe that emits pollutants\na few feet from the ocean would presumably qualify on de\nminimis grounds, but if the pipe were moved back any\nsignificant distance, the discharge would not be exactly\nequal to a direct discharge. There would be some lag from\nthe time of the discharge to the time when the pollutant\nreaches navigable waters; some of the pollutant might not\nreach that destination; and the pollutant might have\nchanged somewhat in composition by the time it reached\nthe navigable waters.\n   For these reasons, the Court\u2019s reference to \u201cthe functional\nequivalent of a direct discharge,\u201d if taken literally, would be\nof little importance, but the Court\u2019s understanding of this\nconcept is very different from the literal meaning of the\nphrase. As used by the Court, \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge\u201d means a discharge that is sufficiently\nsimilar to a direct discharge to warrant a permit in light of\nthe Clean Water Act\u2019s \u201clanguage, structure, and purposes.\u201d\nSee ante, at 18. But what, in concrete terms, does this\nmean? How similar is sufficiently similar?\n   The Court provides this guidance. It explains that time\nand distance are the most important factors, ante, at 16, but\nit does not set any time or distance limits except to observe\nthat a permit is needed where the discharge is a few feet\naway from navigable waters and that a permit is not re-\nquired where the discharge is far away and it takes \u201cmany\nyears\u201d for the pollutants to complete the journey. Ante, at\n15\u201316. Beyond this, the Court provides a list (and a non-\nexhaustive one at that!) of five other factors that may be\nrelevant: \u201cthe nature of the material through which the pol-\nlutant travels,\u201d \u201cthe extent to which the pollutant is diluted\n\f8       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nor chemically changed as it travels,\u201d \u201cthe amount of pollu-\ntant entering the navigable waters relative to the amount\nof the pollutant that leaves the point source,\u201d \u201cthe manner\nby or area in which the pollutant enters the navigable wa-\nters,\u201d and \u201cthe degree to which the pollution (at that point)\nhas maintained its specific identity.\u201d Ante, at 16.\n   The Court admits that its rule \u201cdoes not, on its own,\nclearly explain how to deal with middle instances,\u201d ibid.,\nbut that admission does not go far enough. How the rule\napplies to \u201cmiddle instances\u201d is anybody\u2019s guess. Except in\nextreme cases, dischargers will be able to argue that the\nCourt\u2019s multifactor test does not require a permit. Oppo-\nnents will be able to make the opposite argument. Regula-\ntors will be able to justify whatever result they prefer in a\nparticular case. And judges will be left at sea.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Instead of concocting our own rule, I would interpret the\nwords of the statute, and in my view, the better of the two\npossible interpretations is that a permit is required when a\npollutant is discharged directly from a point source to nav-\nigable waters. This interpretation is consistent with the\nstatutory language and better fits the overall scheme of the\nClean Water Act. And properly understood, it does not have\nthe sort of extreme consequences that the Court finds\nunacceptable.\n   Take the Court\u2019s example of a pipe that discharges pollu-\ntants a short distance from the ocean. Ante, at 10. This\npipe qualifies as a point source. 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(14). If\nits discharge goes directly into another point source and\nthat point source discharges directly into navigable waters,\nthere is a direct discharge into navigable waters, and a per-\nmit is needed.

But I take\nJUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s opinion to foreclose liability in one situation where I\nbelieve a permit would be required: a discharge from multiple, linked\npoint sources. In my view, a permit is required in that instance because\na pollutant would ultimately be added to navigable waters directly from\na point source.\n   Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 743\u2013744 (plurality\nopinion), supports this conclusion. Rapanos addressed the meaning of\nthe term \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d and Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion con-\ncluded that this term does not apply to \u201c[w]etlands with only an inter-\nmittent, physically remote hydrologic connection to [such waters].\u201d Id.,\nat 742. At one point in his opinion, Justice Scalia responded to the argu-\nment that this interpretation would allow polluters to evade the permit\nrequirement \u201csimply by discharging their pollutants into noncovered in-\ntermittent watercourses that lie upstream of covered waters.\u201d Id., at\n743. Arguing that this was not likely to occur, he identified two lines of\nlower court authority that would prevent such evasion, but he did not\nendorse either. Ibid.\n   One of these lines was based on exactly the interpretation set out in\nthis opinion, namely, that \u201csuch upstream, intermittently flowing chan-\nnels themselves constitute \u2018point sources\u2019 \u201d under the Act\u2019s broad defini-\ntion of that term. Ibid. The other line, as described in Justice Scalia\u2019s\nopinion, \u201cheld that the discharge into intermittent channels of any pol-\nlutant that naturally washes downstream likely [requires a permit] even\nif the pollutants discharged from a point source do not emit \u2018directly into\u2019\ncovered waters, but pass \u2018through conveyances\u2019 in between.\u201d Ibid. (em-\nphasis in original). To the extent these lower court cases are understood\nas holding that a permit is required whenever a pollutant \u201cnaturally\u201d\nreaches waters of the United States, their reasoning would conflict with\nthe Court\u2019s rejection of the theory that a permit is required whenever a\npollutant that originated from a point source ultimately reaches covered\nwaters. But as Justice Scalia noted, in the two cases he cited, the pollu-\ntants were discharged from point sources into \u201cconveyances\u201d that, in\nturn, brought the pollutants to covered waters. Ibid. And the convey-\nances in both cases, a sewer system and tunnel, ibid., could easily fall\nwithin the broad definition of a point source.\n   In short, at least one and perhaps both of the lines of lower court cases\nto which Justice Scalia referred are fully consistent with the interpreta-\ntion set out in this opinion. The same is true of his statement, discussed\nby JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, ante, at 1\u20132 (concurring opinion), that the Clean\n\f10         COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   That a permit is required in this situation is important\nbecause the Clean Water Act\u2019s definition of a \u201cpoint source\u201d\nis very broad, and as a result, many discharges onto the\nsurface of land are likely to be covered. As noted, \u201cpoint\nsource[s]\u201d include \u201cditch[es]\u201d and \u201cchannel[s],\u201d as well as\n\u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance . . . from\nwhich pollutants . . . may be discharged.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\nTherefore if water discharged on the surface of the land\nfinds or creates a passage leading to navigable waters, a\npermit may be required if the course that the discharge\ntakes is (1) a \u201cconveyance\u201d that is (2) \u201cdiscernible\u201d and (3)\n\u201cconfined.\u201d\n   Those three requirements are rather easily satisfied.\nWhen a liquid flows over the surface of land to navigable\nwaters, the surface is a conveyance, i.e., a \u201cmeans of carry-\ning or transporting something\u201d from one place to another.\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 499 (1971)\n(Webster\u2019s Third); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 320 (1967) (Random House).6 This conveyance\nwould be \u201cdiscernible,\u201d i.e., capable of being seen. Webster\u2019s\nThird 644; Random House 409. And it would be \u201cconfined,\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWater Act \u201cdoes not forbid the \u2018addition of any pollutant directly to nav-\nigable waters from any point source.\u2019 \u201d 547 U. S., at 743. As noted, Jus-\ntice Scalia\u2019s opinion is open to the possibility that a permit is required if\npoint source A discharges into point source B, and point source B then\ndischarges into covered waters. Thus, his opinion apparently regards\nthat situation as involving an indirect discharge. I would describe that\ndischarge as direct because point source B discharges directly into cov-\nered waters, but the difference is purely semantic.\n   6 As we have said, the Act\u2019s point-source \u201cdefinition makes plain that a\n\npoint source need not be the original source of the pollutant; it need only\nconvey the pollutant to \u2018navigable waters,\u2019 which are, in turn, defined as\n\u2018the waters of the United States.\u2019 \u201d South Fla. Water Management Dist.\nv. Miccosukee Tribe, 541 U. S. 95, 105 (2004). The label is a bit of a mis-\nnomer: Although labeled \u201cpoint sources,\u201d \u201c[t]ellingly, the examples . . .\nlisted by the Act include pipes, ditches, tunnels, and conduits, objects\nthat do not themselves generate pollutants but merely transport them.\u201d\nIbid. (citing \u00a71362(14)).\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                   11\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ni.e., held within bounds, see Webster\u2019s Third 476; Random\nHouse 308, if the topography of the land in question im-\nposes some boundaries on its flow.\n   If the term \u201cpoint source\u201d is read in this way, it would\nhave a broad reach and would cover many of the cases that\ntrouble the Court. Moreover\u2014and I find this point partic-\nularly important\u2014even if this interpretation fails to cap-\nture every case that seems to call out for regulation, that\nwould not mean that these cases would necessarily remain\nunchecked. The States have the authority to regulate the\ndischarge of pollutants by non-point sources. See 33\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71285(j), 1314(f ), 1329(i), 1329(b)(1), (h). They are\nentrusted with a vital role under the Clean Water Act, and\nthere is no reason to believe that they would tolerate cases\nof abuse.\n   The interpretation I have outlined is not only consistent\nwith the statutory language; it is strongly supported by the\nClean Water Act\u2019s regulatory scheme for at least two rea-\nsons. First, it respects Congress\u2019 decision to treat point-\nsource pollution differently from non-point-source pollu-\ntion, including pollution conveyed by groundwater. See 84\nFed. Reg. 16832.7 The Court itself recognizes this:\n     \u201c[T]he structure of the statute indicates that, as to\n     groundwater pollution and non[-]point source pollu-\n     tion, Congress intended to leave substantial responsi-\n     bility and autonomy to the States.\u201d Ante, at 6.\n     \u201cOver many decades, and with federal encouragement,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Act contains a number of references to groundwater (a non-point\n\nsource) outside the NPDES context. The Act textually distinguishes\ngroundwater from surface water and navigable waters, \u00a71252(a), pro-\nvides funding for state regulation of groundwater pollution, and suggests\nthat groundwater is a non-point source. See \u00a71329(h)(5)(D) (authorizing\nEPA to prioritize grants to States that have implemented or proposed\n\u201ccarry[ing] out groundwater quality protection activities which [EPA] de-\ntermines are part of a comprehensive non[-]point source pollution control\nprogram\u201d).\n\f12       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n     the States have developed methods of regulating non-\n     point source pollution through water quality stand-\n     ards, and otherwise.\u201d Ibid.\n     \u201cThe Act envisions EPA\u2019s role in managing non[-]point\n     source pollution and groundwater pollution as limited\n     to studying the issue, sharing information with and\n     collecting information from the States, and issuing\n     monetary grants.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nPoint sources are readily identifiable and therefore more\nsusceptible to uniform nationwide regulation. Non-point\nsource pollution, on the other hand, often presents more\ncomplicated issues that are better suited to individualized\nlocal solutions. See Shanty Town Assns. L. P. v. EPA, 843\nF. 2d 782, 791 (CA4 1988) (\u201c[T]he control of non[-]point\nsource pollution was so dependent on such site-specific fac-\ntors as topography, soil structure, rainfall, vegetation, and\nland use that its uniform federal regulation was virtually\nimpossible\u201d); Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA,\n915 F. 2d 1314, 1316 (CA9 1990) (\u201cThe Act focused on point\nsource polluters presumably because they could be\nidentified and regulated more easily than non[-]point\nsource polluters\u201d); Brief for State of West Virginia et al. as\nAmici Curiae 14\u201318.\n  Second, this bright-line rule is consistent with the Act\u2019s\nremedial scheme. The Clean Water Act imposes a regime\nof strict liability, \u00a7\u00a71311, 1342, 1344, backed by criminal\npenalties and steep civil fines, \u00a71319. Thus, \u201cthe conse-\nquences to landowners even for inadvertent violations can\nbe crushing.\u201d Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., 578\nU. S. ___, ___ (2016) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (slip op., at\n1). The Act authorizes as much as $54,833 in fines per day\n(or more than $20 million per year), 40 CFR \u00a719.4; 84 Fed.\nReg. 2059, and contains a 5-year statute of limitations, 28\nU. S.

The inter-\npretation set out above, by providing a relatively\nstraightforward rule, provides a measure of fair notice and\npromotes good-faith compliance.\n                              B\n  The alternative way in which the statutory language\ncould be interpreted\u2014reading \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201coriginally\nfrom\u201d\u2014would lead to extreme results, as the Court recog-\nnizes. And while state regulation could fill any unwar-\nranted gaps left by the interpretation I have outlined, there\nwould be no apparent remedy for the overreach that would\nresult from interpreting \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201coriginally from.\u201d\n  The extreme consequences of that interpretation are\nshown most dramatically by its potential application to or-\ndinary homeowners with septic tanks, a problem that the\nEPA highlighted in a recent Interpretive Statement. See\nInterpretive Statement on Application of the Clean Water\nAct NPDES Program to Releases of Pollutants From a Point\nSource to Groundwater, 84 Fed. Reg. 16824 (2019). Septic\nsystems\u2014used by 26 million American homes\u2014generally\noperate by \u201cdischarging liquid effluent into perforated pipes\nburied in a leach field, chambers, or other special units de-\nsigned to slowly release the effluent into the soil.\u201d Id., at\n16812. That effluent then percolates through the soil and\n\u201ccan in certain circumstances ultimately enter groundwa-\nter.\u201d Ibid.8 Congress most certainly did not intend that or-\ndinary homeowners with septic systems obtain NPDES\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 According to the EPA, numerous other conveyances that deposit pol-\n\nlutants into groundwater could now require NPDES permits. \u201cActivities\nlisted by commentators included aquifer recharge, leaks from sewage col-\nlection systems, . . . treatment systems such as constructed wetlands,\nspills and accidental releases, manure management, and coal ash\nimpoundment seepage.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 16812. The County and amici\n\f14        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npermits\u2014or that they face severe penalties for failing to do\nso. That, however, is where this alternative interpretation\nwould lead.\n   And the same is true for the test adopted by the Ninth\nCircuit. The Ninth Circuit held that a permit is required if\na pollutant that reaches navigable waters is \u201cfairly trace-\nable,\u201d but there is no real difference between \u201cfairly trace-\nable\u201d and \u201coriginally from.\u201d Unless a pollutant is \u201ctraceable\u201d\nto a point source, how could that point source be required\nto get a permit? And the addition of the qualifier \u201cfairly\u201d\ndoes not seem to add anything. What would it mean for a\npollutant to be \u201cunfairly traceable\u201d to a point source?\nTraceable only as a result of a method that is scientifically\nunsound? In that situation, why would a court consider the\npollutant to be traceable to the source in question at all? So\nif a pollutant can be reliably determined to have originally\ncome from a point source, a permit would appear to be re-\nquired under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test.\n   Respondents, instead of defending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation, argue that a discharge from a point source\nmust be the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of a pollutant\u2019s reaching\nnavigable waters. Brief for Respondents 12. But as the\nCourt concludes, ante, at 6, there is no basis for transplant-\ning this concept from the law of torts into the Clean Water\nAct, and it is unclear what it would mean in that context.\n   For these reasons, of the two possible interpretations of\nthe statutory terms, the better is the interpretation that\nreads \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201cdirectly from.\u201d\n                            C\n  Even if the Court were to find \u00a71362(12) ambiguous, ap-\nplicable clear statement rules foreclose the \u201cfunctional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nalso assert that respondents\u2019 theory would require permits for green in-\nfrastructure, water reuse, and groundwater discharge.

The\nCourt has required a clear statement of congressional in-\ntent when an administrative agency seeks to interpret a\nstatute in a way that entails \u201ca significant impingement of\nthe States\u2019 traditional and primary power over land and wa-\nter use,\u201d Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army\nCorps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 174 (2001) (SWANCC ),\nand when it adopts a new and expanded interpretation of a\nstatute, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302\n(2014) (UARG). The same rules should apply here where\nwhat is at issue is a new theory propounded by private\nplaintiffs.\n   First, the Court\u2019s \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d test unques-\ntionably impinges on the States\u2019 traditional authority. In\nSWANCC, the Court struck down the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 \u201cMigratory Bird Rule\u201d as inconsistent with the Clean\nWater Act because the rule effectively displaced state au-\nthority over land and water use. In this case, the federalism\ninterest is even stronger because the Clean Water Act itself\nassigns non-point-source-pollution regulation to the States\nand explicitly recognizes and protects the state role in envi-\nronmental protection. 33 U. S. C. \u00a71251(b). The \u201cfunctional\nequivalent\u201d standard expands federal point source regula-\ntion at the expense of state non-point source regulation.\nAnd as a practical matter, States would be saddled with the\ncosts of increased NPDES permitting (because States gen-\nerally award permits in place of the EPA), while exercising\ndiminished control over non-point source pollution within\ntheir territory. See Brief for State of West Virginia et al. as\nAmici Curiae 27\u201334.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s test offends the clear-statement rule\nrecognized in UARG by expanding the authority of the\nEPA. Congress must speak clearly if it \u201cwishes to assign to\nan agency decisions of vast \u2018economic and political signifi-\ncance.\u2019 \u201d 573 U. S., at 324 (quoting FDA v.

HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nUARG, the EPA had promulgated greenhouse-gas emission\nstandards for stationary sources that \u201cconstitute[d] an \u2018un-\nprecedented expansion of EPA authority that would have a\nprofound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and\ntouch every household in the land.\u2019 \u201d 573 U. S., at 310\u2013311\n(quoting 73 Fed. Reg. 44355 (2008)). The statutory scheme,\ndesigned for large stationary sources like factories, would\nhave been extended to smaller sources like hotels and retail\nestablishments. The number of permits (and associated ex-\npenses) would have skyrocketed.\n  Here, as the EPA explained in a recent Interpretive\nStatement, the Fourth and Ninth Circuit \u201cdischarge\u201d\ntests\u2014which I struggle to distinguish from the \u201cfunctional\nequivalent\u201d formulation\u2014broaden the Act\u2019s coverage to\n\u201cpotentially swee[p] into the scope of the statute common-\nplace and ubiquitous activities such as releases from home-\nowners\u2019 backyard septic systems.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 16823.\n                               IV\n   The Court does little to justify its newfound standard,\nother than to point to certain past EPA enforcement ac-\ntions, see ante, at 8\u20139, 17, but the EPA\u2019s position on the\nregulation of groundwater has been anything but con-\nsistent. It is true, as the Court recounts, that the EPA has\nrequired NPDES permits for the discharge of some pollu-\ntants that migrate through groundwater before reaching\nnavigable waters. See ante, at 8\u20139. But the EPA has\ncontradicted itself on this important question multiple\ntimes. See Brief for Edison Electric Institute et al. as Amici\nCuriae 21\u201332 (reviewing EPA NPDES interpretations and\npermitting practices).\n   In the Act\u2019s earliest years, the EPA deputy general coun-\nsel wrote in a formal memorandum that \u201c[d]ischarges into\nground waters\u201d do not require NPDES permits.

Reg. 3018\n(2001).\n  Similarly, in its 2019 Interpretive Statement, the EPA\nacknowledged its \u201c[l]ack of consistent and comprehensive\ndirection\u201d on this issue. See 84 Fed. Reg. 16820; see also\nBrief for Edison Electric Institute et al. as Amici Curiae 21\u2013\n32 (recounting EPA historical approach to NPDES permit-\nting). But it added that \u201cthe best, if not the only, reading of\nthe [Act] is that all releases to groundwater are excluded\nfrom the scope of the NPDES program, even where pollu-\ntants are conveyed to jurisdictional surface waters via\ngroundwater.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 16814.\n  In short, the EPA\u2019s inconsistent position on the ground-\nwater issue does not provide a sufficient basis for the\nCourt\u2019s new \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d test.\n                         *     *    *\n   The Court adopts a nebulous standard, enumerates a\nnon-exhaustive list of potentially relevant factors, and\nwashes its hands of the problem.

Argued November 6, 2019\u2014Decided April 23, 2020\nThe Clean Water Act forbids \u201cany addition\u201d of any pollutant from \u201cany\n  point source\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d without an appropriate permit\n  from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 502(12),\n  86 Stat. 844, 886. The Act defines \u201cpollutant\u201d broadly, \u00a7502(6); defines\n  a \u201cpoint source\u201d as \u201c \u2018any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance\n  . . . from which pollutants are or may be discharged,\u2019 \u201d including, e.g.,\n  any \u201c \u2018container,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018well,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(14); and defines the term \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d as \u201c \u2018any ad-\n  dition of any pollutant to navigable waters [including navigable\n  streams, rivers, the ocean, or coastal waters] from any point source,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(12). It then uses those terms in making \u201cunlawful\u201d \u201c \u2018the dis-\n  charge of any pollutant by any person\u2019 \u201d without an appropriate permit.\n  \u00a7301.\n      Petitioner County of Maui\u2019s wastewater reclamation facility collects\n  sewage from the surrounding area, partially treats it, and each day\n  pumps around 4 million gallons of treated water into the ground\n  through four wells.

HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    direct discharge from a point source into navigable waters or when\n    there is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Pp. 4\u201318.\n       (a) Statutory context limits the reach of the phrase \u201cfrom any point\n    source\u201d to a range of circumstances narrower than that which the\n    Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d interpretation suggests. At the same\n    time, it is significantly broader than the total exclusion of all dis-\n    charges through groundwater, as urged by Maui and by the Solicitor\n    General as amicus curiae. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d limitation could allow EPA\n    to assert permitting authority over the release of pollutants that reach\n    navigable waters many years after their release. But Congress did not\n    intend to provide EPA with such broad authority. First, to interpret\n    \u201cfrom\u201d so broadly might require a permit in unexpected circumstances,\n    such as, e.g., the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250 miles of\n    groundwater to a river. Second, the statute\u2019s structure indicates that,\n    as to groundwater pollution and nonpoint source pollution, Congress\n    left substantial responsibility and autonomy to the States and did not\n    give EPA authority that could seriously interfere with this state re-\n    sponsibility. Third, the Act\u2019s legislative history strongly supports the\n    conclusion that the permitting provision does not extend so far. Fi-\n    nally, longstanding regulatory practice shows that EPA has success-\n    fully applied the permitting provision to pollution discharges from\n    point sources that reached navigable waters through groundwater\n    using a narrower interpretation than that of the Ninth Circuit. Pp. 5\u2013\n    10.\n       (c) Maui, the Government, and the two dissents argue for interpre-\n    tations that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purposes,\n    are also too extreme. Pp. 10\u201315.\n          (1) Maui and the Solicitor General argue that the statute\u2019s per-\n    mitting requirement does not apply if a pollutant, having emerged\n    from a \u201cpoint source,\u201d must travel through any amount of groundwater\n    before reaching navigable waters. That narrow interpretation would\n    risk serious interference with EPA\u2019s ability to regulate point source\n    discharges, and Congress would not have intended to create such a\n    large and obvious loophole in one of the Clean Water Act\u2019s key regula-\n    tory innovations. P. 10.\n          (2) Reading \u201cfrom\u201d in the phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d together\n    with \u201cconveyance\u201d in the point source definition \u201cany . . . conveyance,\u201d\n    Maui argues that the meaning of \u201cfrom any point source\u201d is not about\n    where the pollution originated, but about how it got there. Thus, Maui\n    claims, a permit is required only if a point source ultimately delivers\n    the pollutant to navigable waters. By contrast, if a pollutant travels\n    through groundwater, then the groundwater is the conveyance and no\n    permit is required. But Maui\u2019s definition of \u201cfrom\u201d as connoting a\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nmeans does not fit in context. Coupling \u201cfrom\u201d with \u201cto\u201d is strong evi-\ndence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnavigable wa-\nters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d). That Maui\u2019s reading would\ncreate a serious loophole in the permitting regime also indicates that\nit is unreasonable. Pp. 10\u201311.\n      (3) The Solicitor General argues that the proper interpretation of\nthe statute is the one reflected in EPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement,\nnamely, that \u201call releases of pollutants to groundwater\u201d are excluded\nfrom the scope of the permitting program, \u201ceven where pollutants are\nconveyed to jurisdictional surface waters via groundwater.\u201d 84 Fed.\nReg. 16810, 16811. That reading, which would open a loophole allow-\ning easy evasion of the statutory provision\u2019s basic purposes, is neither\npersuasive nor reasonable. EPA is correct that Congress did not re-\nquire a permit for all discharges to groundwater, and it did authorize\nstudy and funding related to groundwater pollution. But the most that\nthe study and funding provisions show is that Congress thought that\nthe problem of pollution in groundwater would primarily be addressed\nby the States or perhaps by other federal statutes. EPA\u2019s new inter-\npretation is also difficult to reconcile with the statute\u2019s reference to\n\u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable waters; with the statute\u2019s\ninclusion of \u201cwells\u201d in the \u201cpoint source\u201d definition, since wells would\nordinarily discharge pollutants through groundwater; and with statu-\ntory provisions that allow EPA to delegate its permitting authority to\na State only if the State, inter alia, provides \u201c \u2018adequate authority\u2019 \u201d to\n\u201c \u2018control the disposal of pollutants into wells,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7402(b). Pp. 11\u201313.\n      (4) Perhaps, as the dissents suggest, the statute\u2019s language could\nbe narrowed by reading the statute to refer only to the pollutant\u2019s im-\nmediate origin, but there is no linguistic basis for this limitation.\nPp. 13\u201315.\n    (d) The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim to provide federal\nregulation of identifiable sources of pollutants entering navigable wa-\nters without undermining the States\u2019 longstanding regulatory author-\nity over land and groundwater. The reading of the statute that best\ncaptures Congress\u2019 meaning, reflected in the statute\u2019s words, struc-\nture, and purposes, is that a permit is required when there is a dis-\ncharge from a point source directly into navigable waters or when\nthere is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Many factors\nmay be relevant to determining whether a particular discharge is the\nfunctional equivalent of one directly into navigable waters. Time and\ndistance will be the most important factors in most cases, but other\nrelevant factors may include, e.g., the nature of the material through\nwhich the pollutant travels and the extent to which the pollutant is\ndiluted or chemically changed as it travels. Courts will provide addi-\ntional guidance through decisions in individual cases. The underlying\n\f4           COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Although this interpretation does not pre-\n    sent as clear a line as the other interpretations proffered, the EPA has\n    applied the permitting provision to some discharges through ground-\n    water for over 30 years, with no evidence of inadministrability or an\n    unmanageable expansion in the statute\u2019s scope.

Brief for United States as Ami-\ncus Curiae 12 (capitalization omitted).\n  We agree that statutory context limits the reach of the\nstatutory phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d to a range of cir-\ncumstances narrower than that which the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation suggests. At the same time, it is signifi-\ncantly broader than the total exclusion of all discharges\nthrough groundwater described by Maui and the Solicitor\nGeneral.\n                              III\n   Virtually all water, polluted or not, eventually makes its\nway to navigable water. This is just as true for groundwa-\nter. See generally 2 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Encyclopedia\n2600 (10th ed. 2008) (defining \u201cHydrology\u201d). Given the\npower of modern science, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s limitation,\n\u201cfairly traceable,\u201d may well allow EPA to assert permitting\nauthority over the release of pollutants that reach naviga-\nble waters many years after their release (say, from a well\nor pipe or compost heap) and in highly diluted forms. See,\ne.g., Brief for Aquatic Scientists et al. as Amici Curiae\n13\u201328.\n   The respondents suggest that the standard can be nar-\nrowed by adding a \u201cproximate cause\u201d requirement.

In the context of water pollution,\nwe do not see how it significantly narrows the statute be-\nyond the words \u201cfairly traceable\u201d themselves.\n   Our view is that Congress did not intend the point source-\npermitting requirement to provide EPA with such broad au-\nthority as the Ninth Circuit\u2019s narrow focus on traceability\nwould allow. First, to interpret the word \u201cfrom\u201d in this lit-\neral way would require a permit in surprising, even bizarre,\ncircumstances, such as for pollutants carried to navigable\nwaters on a bird\u2019s feathers, or, to mention more mundane\ninstances, the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250\nmiles of groundwater to a river.\n   Second, and perhaps most important, the structure of the\nstatute indicates that, as to groundwater pollution and non-\npoint source pollution, Congress intended to leave substan-\ntial responsibility and autonomy to the States. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7101(b), 86 Stat. 816 (stating Congress\u2019 purpose in this re-\ngard). Much water pollution does not come from a readily\nidentifiable source. See 3 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Ency-\nclopedia, at 5801 (defining \u201cWater Pollution\u201d). Rainwater,\nfor example, can carry pollutants (say, as might otherwise\ncollect on a roadway); it can pollute groundwater, and pol-\nlution collected by unchanneled rainwater runoff is not or-\ndinarily considered point source pollution. Over many dec-\nades, and with federal encouragement, the States have\ndeveloped methods of regulating nonpoint source pollution\nthrough water quality standards, and otherwise.

Although the Act grants\nEPA specific authority to regulate certain point source pol-\nlution (it can also delegate some of this authority to the\nStates acting under EPA supervision, see \u00a7402(b), 86 Stat.\n880), these permitting provisions refer to \u201cpoint sources\u201d\nand \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d and say nothing at all about non-\npoint source regulation or groundwater regulation. We\nmust doubt that Congress intended to give EPA the author-\nity to apply the word \u201cfrom\u201d in a way that could interfere as\nseriously with States\u2019 traditional regulatory authority\u2014au-\nthority the Act preserves and promotes\u2014as the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d test would.\n   Third, those who look to legislative history to help inter-\npret a statute will find that this Act\u2019s history strongly\nsupports our conclusion that the permitting provision does not\nextend so far. Fifty years ago, when Congress was consid-\nering the bills that became the Clean Water Act, William\nRuckelshaus, the first EPA Administrator, asked Congress\nto grant EPA authority over \u201cground waters\u201d to \u201cassure that\n\f8        COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Representative Les Aspin similarly\npointed out that there were \u201cconspicuou[s ]\u201d references to\ngroundwater in all sections of the bill except the permitting\nsection at issue here. Water Pollution Control Legislation\u2013\n1971: Hearings before the House Committee on Public\nWorks on H. R. 11896 and H. R. 11895, 92d Cong., 1st Sess.,\n727 (1972).

It rejected Representa-\ntive Aspin\u2019s amendment that would have extended the per-\nmitting provision to groundwater. Instead, Congress pro-\nvided a set of more specific groundwater-related measures\nsuch as those requiring States to maintain \u201caffirmative con-\ntrols over the injection or placement in wells\u201d of \u201cany pollu-\ntants that may affect ground water.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span> These specific\nstate-related </span><pre class=\"inline\">programs were, in the words of the Senate\nPublic Works Committee, \u201cdesigned to protect ground wa-\nters and eliminate the use of deep well disposal as an un-\ncontrolled alternative to toxic and pollution control.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span>\nThe upshot is </span><pre class=\"inline\">that Congress was fully aware of the need to\naddress groundwater pollution, but it satisfied that need\nthrough a variety of state-specific controls.

Indeed, EPA itself has\nchanged its mind about the meaning of the statutory provi-\nsion. See infra, at 12\u201314. But this history, by showing that\na comparatively narrow view of the statute is administra-\ntively workable, offers some additional support for the view\nthat Congress did not intend as broad a delegation of regu-\nlatory authority as the Ninth Circuit test would allow.\n   As we have said, the specific meaning of the word \u201cfrom\u201d\n\f10        COUNTY OF MAUI v.

There is an \u201caddition of \u201d a \u201cpollutant to navigable\nwaters from [a] point source.\u201d Hence, a permit is required.\nBut Maui and the Government read the permitting require-\nment not to apply if there is any amount of groundwater\nbetween the end of the pipe and the edge of the navigable\nwater. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136, 24\u201325. If that is the correct\ninterpretation of the statute, then why could not the pipe\u2019s\nowner, seeking to avoid the permit requirement, simply\nmove the pipe back, perhaps only a few yards, so that the\npollution must travel through at least some groundwater\nbefore reaching the sea?

That language requires a permit for a \u201cdischarge.\u201d\nA \u201cdischarge\u201d is \u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable\nwaters \u201cfrom any point source.\u201d And a \u201cpoint source\u201d is \u201cany\ndiscernible, confined and discrete conveyance\u201d (such as a\npipe, ditch, well, etc.). Reading \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d to-\ngether, Maui argues that the statutory meaning of \u201cfrom\nany point source\u201d is not about where the pollution origi-\nnated, but about how it got there. Under what Maui calls\nthe means-of-delivery test, a permit is required only if a\npoint source itself ultimately delivers the pollutant to nav-\nigable waters. Under this view, if the pollutant must travel\nthrough groundwater to reach navigable waters, then it is\nthe groundwater, not the pipe, that is the conveyance.\n  Congress sometimes adopts less common meanings of\ncommon words, but this esoteric definition of \u201cfrom,\u201d as con-\nnoting a means, does not remotely fit in this context. The\nstatute couples the word \u201cfrom\u201d with the word \u201cto\u201d\u2014strong\nevidence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnav-\nigable waters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d).

That Maui\u2019s proffered interpre-\ntation would also create a serious loophole in the permitting\nregime also indicates it is an unreasonable one.\n                              C\n   The Solicitor General agrees that, as a general matter,\nthe permitting requirement applies to at least some addi-\ntions of pollutants to navigable waters that come indirectly\nfrom point sources. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 33\u201335. But the Solicitor General argues that the\nproper interpretation of the statute is the one reflected in\nEPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement.

Indeed, the expansive language of the provision\u2014any\naddition from any point source\u2014strongly suggests its scope\nis not so limited.\n   JUSTICE ALITO appears to believe that there are only two\npossible ways to read \u201cfrom\u201d: as referring either to the im-\nmediate source, or else to the original source. Post, at 5, 8.\nBecause he agrees that the statute cannot reasonably be\nread always to reach the original source, he concludes the\nstatute must refer only to the immediate origin. But as the\nforegoing example illustrates, context may indicate that\n\u201cfrom\u201d includes an intermediate stop\u2014Baltimore, not Eu-\nrope or the train station.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS relies on the word \u201caddition,\u201d but we fail\nto see how that word limits the statute to discharges di-\nrectly to navigable waters. Ordinary language abounds in\ncounter examples: A recipe might instruct to \u201cadd the drip-\npings from the meat to the gravy\u201d; that instruction does not\nbecome incomprehensible, or even peculiar, simply because\nthe drippings will have first collected in a pan or on a cut-\nting board. And while it would be an unusual phrasing (as\nstatutory phrasings often are), we do not see how the rec-\nipe\u2019s meaning would transform if it instead said to \u201cadd the\ndrippings to the gravy from the meat.\u201d To take another ex-\nample: If Timmy is told to \u201cadd water to the bath from the\nwell\u201d he will know just what it means\u2014even though he will\nhave to use a bucket to complete the task.\n   And although JUSTICE THOMAS resists the inevitable im-\nplications of his reading of the statute, post, at 5\u20136, that\nreading would create the same loopholes as those offered by\nthe petitioner and the Government, and more. It would nec-\nessarily exclude a pipe that drains onto the beach next to\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnavigable waters, even if the pollutants then flow to those\nwaters. It also seems to exclude a pipe that hangs out over\nthe water and adds pollutants to the air, through which the\npollutants fall to navigable waters. The absurdity of such\nan interpretation is obvious enough.\n  We therefore reject this reading as well: Like Maui\u2019s and\nthe Government\u2019s, it is inconsistent with the statutory text\nand simultaneously creates a massive loophole in the per-\nmitting scheme that Congress established.\n                              E\n  For the reasons set forth in Part III and in this Part, we\nconclude that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure,\nand purposes, the interpretations offered by the parties, the\nGovernment, and the dissents are too extreme.\n                              V\n  Over the years, courts and EPA have tried to find general\nlanguage that will reflect a middle ground between these\nextremes. The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim\nto provide federal regulation of identifiable sources of pol-\nlutants entering navigable waters without undermining the\nStates\u2019 longstanding regulatory authority over land and\ngroundwater. We hold that the statute requires a permit\nwhen there is a direct discharge from a point source into\nnavigable waters or when there is the functional equivalent\nof a direct discharge. We think this phrase best captures,\nin broad terms, those circumstances in which Congress in-\ntended to require a federal permit. That is, an addition falls\nwithin the statutory requirement that it be \u201cfrom any point\nsource\u201d when a point source directly deposits pollutants\ninto navigable waters, or when the discharge reaches the\nsame result through roughly similar means.\n  Time and distance are obviously important. Where a pipe\nends a few feet from navigable waters and the pipe emits\npollutants that travel those few feet through groundwater\n\f16      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(or over the beach), the permitting requirement clearly ap-\nplies. If the pipe ends 50 miles from navigable waters and\nthe pipe emits pollutants that travel with groundwater, mix\nwith much other material, and end up in navigable waters\nonly many years later, the permitting requirements likely\ndo not apply.\n   The object in a given scenario will be to advance, in a\nmanner consistent with the statute\u2019s language, the statu-\ntory purposes that Congress sought to achieve. As we have\nsaid (repeatedly), the word \u201cfrom\u201d seeks a \u201cpoint source\u201d\norigin, and context imposes natural limits as to when a\npoint source can properly be considered the origin of pollu-\ntion that travels through groundwater. That context in-\ncludes the need, reflected in the statute, to preserve state\nregulation of groundwater and other nonpoint sources of\npollution. Whether pollutants that arrive at navigable wa-\nters after traveling through groundwater are \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource depends upon how similar to (or different from) the\nparticular discharge is to a direct discharge.\n   The difficulty with this approach, we recognize, is that it\ndoes not, on its own, clearly explain how to deal with middle\ninstances. But there are too many potentially relevant fac-\ntors applicable to factually different cases for this Court\nnow to use more specific language. Consider, for example,\njust some of the factors that may prove relevant (depending\nupon the circumstances of a particular case): (1) transit\ntime, (2) distance traveled, (3) the nature of the material\nthrough which the pollutant travels, (4) the extent to which\nthe pollutant is diluted or chemically changed as it travels,\n(5) the amount of pollutant entering the navigable waters\nrelative to the amount of the pollutant that leaves the point\nsource, (6) the manner by or area in which the pollutant\nenters the navigable waters, (7) the degree to which the pol-\nlution (at that point) has maintained its specific identity.\nTime and distance will be the most important factors in\nmost cases, but not necessarily every case.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, courts can provide guidance through\ndecisions in individual cases. The Circuits have tried to do\nso, often using general language somewhat similar to the\nlanguage we have used. And the traditional common-law\nmethod, making decisions that provide examples that in\nturn lead to ever more refined principles, is sometimes use-\nful, even in an era of statutes.\n   The underlying statutory objectives also provide guid-\nance. Decisions should not create serious risks either of un-\ndermining state regulation of groundwater or of creating\nloopholes that undermine the statute\u2019s basic federal regu-\nlatory objectives.\n   EPA, too, can provide administrative guidance (within\nstatutory boundaries) in numerous ways, including\nthrough, for example, grants of individual permits, promul-\ngation of general permits, or the development of general\nrules. Indeed, over the years, EPA and the States have of-\nten considered the Act\u2019s application to discharges through\ngroundwater.\n   Both Maui and the Government object that to subject dis-\ncharges to navigable waters through groundwater to the\nstatute\u2019s permitting requirements, as our interpretation\nwill sometimes do, would vastly expand the scope of the\nstatute, perhaps requiring permits for each of the 650,000\nwells like petitioner\u2019s or for each of the over 20 million sep-\ntic systems used in many Americans\u2019 homes.

In that time we have seen no\nevidence of unmanageable expansion.

HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhere appropriate. See, e.g., 40 CFR \u00a7122.44(k) (2019).\nJudges, too, can mitigate any hardship or injustice when\nthey apply the statute\u2019s penalty provision. That provision\nvests courts with broad discretion to set a penalty that\ntakes account of many factors, including \u201cany good-faith ef-\nforts to comply\u201d with the Act, the \u201cseriousness of the viola-\ntion,\u201d the \u201ceconomic impact of the penalty on the violator,\u201d\nand \u201csuch other matters as justice may require.\u201d See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71319(d). We expect that district judges will exer-\ncise their discretion mindful, as we are, of the complexities\ninherent to the context of indirect discharges through\ngroundwater, so as to calibrate the Act\u2019s penalties when, for\nexample, a party could reasonably have thought that a per-\nmit was not required.\n   In sum, we recognize that a more absolute position, such\nas the means-of-delivery test or that of the Government or\nthat of the Ninth Circuit, may be easier to administer. But,\nas we have said, those positions have consequences that are\ninconsistent with major congressional objectives, as re-\nvealed by the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purposes.\nWe consequently understand the permitting requirement,\n\u00a7301, as applicable to a discharge (from a point source) of\npollutants that reach navigable waters after traveling\nthrough groundwater if that discharge is the functional\nequivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into\nnavigable waters.\n                            VI\n  Because the Ninth Circuit applied a different standard,\nwe vacate its judgment and remand the case for further pro-\nceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

I write separately to\nemphasize three points.\n   First, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act\nregarding pollution \u201cfrom\u201d point sources adheres to the in-\nterpretation set forth in Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in\nRapanos v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145642\"><a href=\"/opinion/145642/rapanos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(2006).

The key word is\n\u201cfrom.\u201d The question in this case is whether the County of\nMaui needs a permit for its Lahaina Wastewater Reclama-\ntion Facility. No one disputes that pollutants originated at\nMaui\u2019s wastewater facility (a point source), and no one dis-\nputes that the pollutants ended up in the Pacific Ocean (a\nnavigable water). Maui contends, however, that it does not\nneed a permit. Maui says that the pollutants did not come\n\u201cfrom\u201d the Lahaina facility because the pollutants traveled\nthrough groundwater before reaching the ocean.\n   Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in Rapanos explained\nwhy Maui\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is incor-\nrect. In that case, Justice Scalia stated that polluters could\nnot \u201cevade the permitting requirement of \u00a71342(a) simply\nby discharging their pollutants into noncovered intermit-\ntent watercourses that lie upstream of covered waters.\u201d 547\n\f2       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nU. S., at 742\u2013743. Justice Scalia reasoned that the Clean\nWater Act does not merely \u201cforbid the \u2018addition of any pol-\nlutant directly to navigable waters from any point source,\u2019\nbut rather the \u2018addition of any pollutant to navigable wa-\nters.\u2019 Thus, from the time of the CWA\u2019s enactment, lower\ncourts have held that the discharge into intermittent chan-\nnels of any pollutant that naturally washes downstream\nlikely violates \u00a71311(a), even if the pollutants discharged\nfrom a point source do not emit \u2018directly into\u2019 covered wa-\nters, but pass \u2018through conveyances\u2019 in between.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145642\"> <a href=\"/opinion/145642/rapanos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span></span> at 743\n</span><pre class=\"inline\"></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(citations omitted).\n   In other words, under Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation in\nRapanos, the fact that the pollutants from Maui\u2019s\nwastewater facility reach the ocean via an indirect route\ndoes not itself exempt Maui\u2019s facility from the Clean Water\nAct\u2019s permitting requirement for point sources. The Court\ntoday adheres to Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis in Rapanos on\nthat issue.\n   Second, as Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Rapanos pointed\nout and as the Court\u2019s opinion today explains, the statute\ndoes not establish a bright-line test regarding when a pol-\nlutant may be considered to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource. The source of the vagueness is Congress\u2019 statutory\ntext, not the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court\u2019s opinion seeks to\ntranslate the vague statutory text into more concrete\nguidance.\n   Third, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent states that \u201cthe Court\ndoes not commit\u201d to \u201cwhich factors are the most important\u201d\nin determining whether pollutants that enter navigable wa-\nters come \u201cfrom\u201d a point source. Post, at 5. That critique is\nnot accurate, as I read the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court iden-\ntifies relevant factors to consider and emphasizes that\n\u201c[t]ime and distance are obviously important.\u201d Ante, at 15.\nAnd the Court expressly adds that \u201c[t]ime and distance will\nbe the most important factors in most cases, but not neces-\nsarily every case.\u201d Ante, at 16.

The CWA defines a \u201cdischarge\u201d as \u201cany\naddition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any\npoint source.\u201d \u00a71362(12).1 Based on the statutory text and\nstructure, I would hold that a permit is required only when\na point source discharges pollutants directly into navigable\nwaters. The Court adopts this interpretation in part, con-\ncluding that a permit is required for \u201ca direct discharge.\u201d\nAnte, at 15. But the Court then departs from the statutory\ntext by requiring a permit for \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge,\u201d ibid., which it defines through an open-\nended inquiry into congressional intent and practical con-\nsiderations.

It defines a \u201cpoint\nsource\u201d as \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including\nbut not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete\nfissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation,\nor vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be dis-\ncharged,\u201d excluding \u201cagricultural stormwater discharges and return\nflows from irrigated agriculture.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary defines \u201caddition\u201d as \u201cthe act or process of adding:\nthe joining or uniting of one thing to another.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 24 (1961); see also</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">ibid.</span>\n(listing \u201cincrease\u201d and </span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201caugmentation\u201d as synonyms for \u201cad-\ndition\u201d). Other dictionary definitions from around the time\nof the statute\u2019s enactment are in accord. See, e.g., American\nHeritage Dictionary 14, 15 (1981) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he act or process of adding\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as \u201c[t]o\njoin or unite so as to increase in size, quantity, or scope\u201d);\nsee also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 29, 30 (2d\ned. 1957) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as the \u201c[a]ct, process, or in-\nstance of adding,\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as to \u201cjoin or unite, as\none thing to another, or as several particulars, so as to in-\ncrease the number, augment the quantity, enlarge the mag-\nnitude, or so as to form into one aggregate\u201d).\n   The inclusion of the term \u201caddition\u201d in the CWA indicates\nthat the statute excludes anything other than a direct dis-\ncharge. When a point source releases pollutants to ground-\nwater, one would naturally say that the groundwater has\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. If\nthe pollutants eventually reach navigable waters, one\nwould not naturally say that the navigable waters have\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. The\naugmentation instead occurs with pollutants from the\ngroundwater.\n   The prepositions \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d reinforce this reading.\nWhen pollutants are released from a point source to another\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npoint source or groundwater, they are added to the second\nfrom the first. If the pollutants are later released to navi-\ngable waters, they are added to the navigable waters from\nthe second point source or the groundwater. One would not\nnaturally say that the pollutants are added to the navigable\nwaters from the original point source.\n   Interpreting \u201cdischarge\u201d to mean a direct discharge\nmakes sense of other parts of the definition as well. It re-\nspects the statutory definition of a point source as a \u201ccon-\nveyance,\u201d see \u00a71362(14), because a point source that re-\nleases pollutants directly into navigable waters is a means\nof conveyance. And it makes sense of the word \u201cany\u201d before\n\u201cpoint source,\u201d because that term clarifies that any kind of\npoint source may require a permit.\n   The structure of the CWA confirms this interpretation. It\nauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to\nregulate discharges from point sources, including through\nthe permitting process, but it reserves to the States the pri-\nmary responsibility for regulating other sources of pollu-\ntion, including groundwater. With respect to these sources,\nthe EPA merely collects information, coordinates with the\nStates, and provides funding.

The Court\u2019s example using \u201carrive\u201d instead of \u201cad-\ndition\u201d is thus unpersuasive, ante, at 13\u201314, because \u201cfrom\u201d\ntakes different meanings with different verbs. The Court\u2019s\nculinary example also misses the mark, ante, at 14, because\nif the drippings from the meat collect in the pan before the\nchef adds them to the gravy, the drippings are added to the\ngravy from the pan, not from the meat. This point becomes\nclear if we reorder the majority\u2019s recipe to match the stat-\nute; the chef has not added the drippings to the gravy from\nthe meat. The Court\u2019s bathwater example, ante, at 14, suf-\nfers from the same problem; if the well water is put in a\nbucket before it is put in the bathtub, it is added to the bath-\ntub from the bucket.

Here, however, the Court makes up a rule\nthat provides no clear guidance and invites arbitrary and\ninconsistent application.\n  The text of the Clean Water Act generally requires a per-\nmit when a discharge \u201cfrom\u201d a \u201cpoint source\u201d (such as a\npipe) \u201cadd[s]\u201d a pollutant \u201cto\u201d navigable waters (such as the\nPacific Ocean). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71362(12). There are two ways\nto read this text. A pollutant that reaches the ocean could\nbe understood to have been added \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if the\npipe originally discharged the pollutant and the pollutant\neventually made its way to the ocean by flowing over or un-\nder the surface of the ground. Or a pollutant that reaches\nthe ocean could be understood to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if\nthe pollutant is discharged from the pipe directly into the\nocean.\n  There is no comprehensible alternative to these two\ninterpretations, but the Court refuses to accept either.\nBoth alternatives, it believes, lead to unacceptable results,\nand it therefore tries to find a middle way. It holds that a\npermit is required \u201cwhen there is a direct discharge from a\npoint source into navigable waters or when there is the\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v.

The Court provides no real answer. All it will say\nis that the distance a pollutant travels and the time this\ntrip entails are the most important factors, but at least five\nother factors may have a bearing on the question, and even\nthis list is not exhaustive. Ante, at 16. Entities like water\ntreatment authorities that need to know whether they must\nget a permit are left to guess how this nebulous standard\nwill be applied. Regulators are given the discretion, at least\nin the first instance, to make of this standard what they\nwill. And the lower courts?

The Act includes a non-exhaustive\nlist of conveyances that fall within this definition, and in-\ncluded on that list are such things as \u201cpipe[s],\u201d \u201cditch[es],\u201d\n\u201cchannel[s],\u201d and \u201cwell[s].\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span>\n   Putting all these </span><pre class=\"inline\">statutory terms together, the rule can\nbe stated as follows: A permit is required when a pollutant\nis \u201cadd[ed]\u201d to navigable waters \u201cfrom\u201d a \u201cpoint source.\u201d In\nthis case, the parties and the EPA agree that most of\nthe elements of this rule are met. Specifically, they agree\nthat: The effluent emitted by the wells is a \u201cpollutant\u201d; this\neffluent reaches navigable waters (the Pacific Ocean); and\nthe wells are \u201cpoint source[s].\u201d The disputed question is\nwhether the emission of effluent from those wells qualifies\nas a \u201cdischarge,\u201d that is, the addition of a pollutant \u201cfrom\u201d\na point source. \u00a71362(12) (emphasis added).\n   There are two possible interpretations of this phrase.\nThe first is that pollutants are added to navigable waters\nfrom a point source whenever they originally came from the\npoint source. The second is that pollutants are added to\nnavigable waters only if they were discharged from a point\nsource directly into navigable waters.\n   Dissatisfied with those options, the Court tries to find a\nthird, but its interpretation is very hard to fit into the stat-\nutory text. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, it appears\nthat a pollutant that leaves a point source and heads to-\nward navigable waters via some non-point source (such as\nby flowing over the ground or by means of groundwater) is\n\u201cfrom\u201d the point source for some portion of its journey, but\nonce it has travelled a certain distance or once a certain\namount of time has elapsed, it is no longer \u201cfrom\u201d the point\nsource and is instead \u201cfrom\u201d a non-point source.\n   This is an implausible reading of the statute. The Court\nhas many inventive examples of the different meanings\nthat can be conveyed by the simple statement that A comes\nfrom B, but one of the Court\u2019s examples\u2014the traveler who\n\f6       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nflies from Europe to Baltimore\u2014illustrates the problem. If\nwe apply the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71362 to this trav-\neler\u2019s journey, he would be \u201cfrom\u201d Europe for the first part\nof the flight, but at some point he might cease to be \u201cfrom\u201d\nEurope and would then be from someplace else, maybe\nGreenland or geographical coordinates in the middle of the\nAtlantic. This is a very strange notion, and therefore, I\nthink the statutory text compels us to choose between the\ntwo alternatives set out above.\n   The Court rejects both of these because it thinks they lead\nto unacceptably extreme results. \u201cOriginally from\u201d would\nimpose liability even if pollutants discharged into ground\nwater had to travel 250 miles over the course of 100 years\nbefore reaching navigable waters. See ante, at 6. And \u201c \u2018im-\nmediately\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018directly\u2019 from,\u201d the Court thinks, would\nmean that a polluter could evade the permit requirement\nby discharging pollutants from a pipe located just a few feet\nfrom navigable waters. Ante, at 14\u201315.\n   To escape these possibilities, the Court devises its own\ntest: A permit is required, the Court holds, \u201cwhen there is a\ndirect discharge from a point source into navigable waters\nor when there is the functional equivalent of a direct dis-\ncharge.\u201d Ante, at 15 (emphasis in original). The Clean Wa-\nter Act, however, says nothing about \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent\u201d of a direct discharge. That is the Court\u2019s own\nconcoction, and the Court provides no clear explanation of\nits meaning.\n   The term \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d may have a quasi-\ntechnical ring, but what does it mean? \u201cEquivalent\u201d means\n\u201cequal\u201d in some respect, and \u201cfunctional\u201d signifies a rela-\ntionship to a function. The function of a direct discharge\nfrom a point source into navigable waters is to convey the\nentirety of the discharge into navigable waters without any\ndelay. Therefore, the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a direct dis-\ncharge of a pollutant into navigable waters would seem to\nbe a discharge that is equal to a direct discharge in these\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrespects.\n   If that is what the Court meant by \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent of a direct discharge,\u201d the test would apply at best to\nonly a small set of situations not involving a direct dis-\ncharge. The Court\u2019s example of a pipe that emits pollutants\na few feet from the ocean would presumably qualify on de\nminimis grounds, but if the pipe were moved back any\nsignificant distance, the discharge would not be exactly\nequal to a direct discharge. There would be some lag from\nthe time of the discharge to the time when the pollutant\nreaches navigable waters; some of the pollutant might not\nreach that destination; and the pollutant might have\nchanged somewhat in composition by the time it reached\nthe navigable waters.\n   For these reasons, the Court\u2019s reference to \u201cthe functional\nequivalent of a direct discharge,\u201d if taken literally, would be\nof little importance, but the Court\u2019s understanding of this\nconcept is very different from the literal meaning of the\nphrase. As used by the Court, \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge\u201d means a discharge that is sufficiently\nsimilar to a direct discharge to warrant a permit in light of\nthe Clean Water Act\u2019s \u201clanguage, structure, and purposes.\u201d\nSee ante, at 18. But what, in concrete terms, does this\nmean? How similar is sufficiently similar?\n   The Court provides this guidance. It explains that time\nand distance are the most important factors, ante, at 16, but\nit does not set any time or distance limits except to observe\nthat a permit is needed where the discharge is a few feet\naway from navigable waters and that a permit is not re-\nquired where the discharge is far away and it takes \u201cmany\nyears\u201d for the pollutants to complete the journey. Ante, at\n15\u201316. Beyond this, the Court provides a list (and a non-\nexhaustive one at that!) of five other factors that may be\nrelevant: \u201cthe nature of the material through which the pol-\nlutant travels,\u201d \u201cthe extent to which the pollutant is diluted\n\f8       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nor chemically changed as it travels,\u201d \u201cthe amount of pollu-\ntant entering the navigable waters relative to the amount\nof the pollutant that leaves the point source,\u201d \u201cthe manner\nby or area in which the pollutant enters the navigable wa-\nters,\u201d and \u201cthe degree to which the pollution (at that point)\nhas maintained its specific identity.\u201d Ante, at 16.\n   The Court admits that its rule \u201cdoes not, on its own,\nclearly explain how to deal with middle instances,\u201d ibid.,\nbut that admission does not go far enough. How the rule\napplies to \u201cmiddle instances\u201d is anybody\u2019s guess. Except in\nextreme cases, dischargers will be able to argue that the\nCourt\u2019s multifactor test does not require a permit. Oppo-\nnents will be able to make the opposite argument. Regula-\ntors will be able to justify whatever result they prefer in a\nparticular case. And judges will be left at sea.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Instead of concocting our own rule, I would interpret the\nwords of the statute, and in my view, the better of the two\npossible interpretations is that a permit is required when a\npollutant is discharged directly from a point source to nav-\nigable waters. This interpretation is consistent with the\nstatutory language and better fits the overall scheme of the\nClean Water Act. And properly understood, it does not have\nthe sort of extreme consequences that the Court finds\nunacceptable.\n   Take the Court\u2019s example of a pipe that discharges pollu-\ntants a short distance from the ocean.

To the extent these lower court cases are understood\nas holding that a permit is required whenever a pollutant \u201cnaturally\u201d\nreaches waters of the United States, their reasoning would conflict with\nthe Court\u2019s rejection of the theory that a permit is required whenever a\npollutant that originated from a point source ultimately reaches covered\nwaters. But as Justice Scalia noted, in the two cases he cited, the pollu-\ntants were discharged from point sources into \u201cconveyances\u201d that, in\nturn, brought the pollutants to covered waters.</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145642\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\"><a href=\"/opinion/145642/rapanos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span></a></span> And the convey-\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">ances in both cases, a sewer system and tunnel, ibid., could easily fall\nwithin the broad definition of a point source.\n   In short, at least one and perhaps both of the lines of lower court cases\nto which Justice Scalia referred are fully consistent with the interpreta-\ntion set out in this opinion. The same is true of his statement, discussed\nby JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, ante, at 1\u20132 (concurring opinion), that the Clean\n\f10         COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   That a permit is required in this situation is important\nbecause the Clean Water Act\u2019s definition of a \u201cpoint source\u201d\nis very broad, and as a result, many discharges onto the\nsurface of land are likely to be covered. As noted, \u201cpoint\nsource[s]\u201d include \u201cditch[es]\u201d and \u201cchannel[s],\u201d as well as\n\u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance . . . from\nwhich pollutants . . . may be discharged.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\nTherefore if water discharged on the surface of the land\nfinds or creates a passage leading to navigable waters, a\npermit may be required if the course that the discharge\ntakes is (1) a \u201cconveyance\u201d that is (2) \u201cdiscernible\u201d and (3)\n\u201cconfined.\u201d\n   Those three requirements are rather easily satisfied.\nWhen a liquid flows over the surface of land to navigable\nwaters, the surface is a conveyance, i.e., a \u201cmeans of carry-\ning or transporting something\u201d from one place to another.\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 499 (1971)\n(Webster\u2019s Third); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 320 (1967) (Random House).6 This conveyance\nwould be \u201cdiscernible,\u201d i.e., capable of being seen.

I would describe that\ndischarge as direct because point source B discharges directly into cov-\nered waters, but the difference is purely semantic.\n   6 As we have said, the Act\u2019s point-source \u201cdefinition makes plain that a\n\npoint source need not be the original source of the pollutant; it need only\nconvey the pollutant to \u2018navigable waters,\u2019 which are, in turn, defined as\n\u2018the waters of the United States.\u2019 \u201d South Fla.

Septic\nsystems\u2014used by 26 million American homes\u2014generally\noperate by \u201cdischarging liquid effluent into perforated pipes\nburied in a leach field, chambers, or other special units de-\nsigned to slowly release the effluent into the soil.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at\n16812. </span><pre class=\"inline\">That effluent then percolates through the soil and\n\u201ccan in certain circumstances ultimately enter groundwa-\nter.\u201d Ibid.8 Congress most certainly did not intend that or-\ndinary homeowners with septic systems obtain NPDES\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 According to the EPA, numerous other conveyances that deposit pol-\n\nlutants into groundwater could now require NPDES permits. \u201cActivities\nlisted by commentators included aquifer recharge, leaks from sewage col-\nlection systems, . . . treatment systems such as constructed wetlands,\nspills and accidental releases, manure management, and coal ash\nimpoundment seepage.\u201d 84 Fed.

That, however, is where this alternative interpretation\nwould lead.\n   And the same is true for the test adopted by the Ninth\nCircuit. The Ninth Circuit held that a permit is required if\na pollutant that reaches navigable waters is \u201cfairly trace-\nable,\u201d but there is no real difference between \u201cfairly trace-\nable\u201d and \u201coriginally from.\u201d Unless a pollutant is \u201ctraceable\u201d\nto a point source, how could that point source be required\nto get a permit? And the addition of the qualifier \u201cfairly\u201d\ndoes not seem to add anything. What would it mean for a\npollutant to be \u201cunfairly traceable\u201d to a point source?\nTraceable only as a result of a method that is scientifically\nunsound? In that situation, why would a court consider the\npollutant to be traceable to the source in question at all? So\nif a pollutant can be reliably determined to have originally\ncome from a point source, a permit would appear to be re-\nquired under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test.\n   Respondents, instead of defending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation, argue that a discharge from a point source\nmust be the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of a pollutant\u2019s reaching\nnavigable waters. Brief for Respondents 12. But as the\nCourt concludes, ante, at 6, there is no basis for transplant-\ning this concept from the law of torts into the Clean Water\nAct, and it is unclear what it would mean in that context.\n   For these reasons, of the two possible interpretations of\nthe statutory terms, the better is the interpretation that\nreads \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201cdirectly from.\u201d\n                            C\n  Even if the Court were to find \u00a71362(12) ambiguous, ap-\nplicable clear statement rules foreclose the \u201cfunctional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nalso assert that respondents\u2019 theory would require permits for green in-\nfrastructure, water reuse, and groundwater discharge.

Argued December 2, 2019\u2014Decided April 27, 2020\nThe Copyright Act grants monopoly protection for \u201coriginal works of au-\n  thorship.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7102(a). Under the government edicts doctrine,\n  officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot be the au-\n  thors of the works they create in the course of their official duties.\n     The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the Official Code of Geor-\n  gia Annotated (OCGA). That Code includes the text of every Georgia\n  statute currently in force, as well as a set of non-binding annotations\n  that appear beneath each statutory provision. The annotations typi-\n  cally include summaries of judicial opinions construing each provision,\n  summaries of pertinent opinions of the state attorney general, and a\n  list of related law review articles and other reference materials. The\n  OCGA is assembled by the Code Revision Commission, a state entity\n  composed mostly of legislators, funded through legislative branch ap-\n  propriations, and staffed by the Office of Legislative Counsel.\n     The annotations in the current OCGA were produced by Matthew\n  Bender & Co., Inc., a division of the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a\n  work-for-hire agreement with the Commission. Under the agreement,\n  Lexis drafts the annotations under the supervision of the Commission,\n  which specifies what the annotations must include in exacting detail.\n  The agreement also states that any copyright in the OCGA vests in the\n  State of Georgia, acting through the Commission.\n     Respondent Public.Resource.Org (PRO), a nonprofit dedicated to fa-\n  cilitating public access to government records and legal materials,\n  posted the OCGA online and distributed copies to various organiza-\n  tions and Georgia officials. After sending PRO several cease-and-de-\n  sist letters, the Commission sued PRO for infringing its copyright in\n  the OCGA annotations. PRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory\n  judgment that the entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\n\f2             GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    public domain. The District Court sided with the Commission, holding\n    that the annotations were eligible for copyright protection because\n    they had not been enacted into law. The Eleventh Circuit reversed,\n    rejecting the Commission\u2019s copyright assertion under the government\n    edicts doctrine.\nHeld: The OCGA annotations are ineligible for copyright protection.\n Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The government edicts doctrine developed from a trio of 19th-\n century cases. In Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, the Court held that no\n reporter can have a copyright in the Court\u2019s opinions and that the Jus-\n tices cannot confer such a right on any reporter. In Banks v. Manches-\n ter, 128 U. S. 244, the Court held that judges could not assert copyright\n in \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity as judges\u201d\u2014be it \u201cthe\n opinion or decision, the statement of the case and the syllabus or the\n head note.\u201d Id., at 253. Finally, in Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617,\n the Court reiterated that an official reporter cannot hold a copyright\n interest in opinions created by judges. But, confronting an issue not\n addressed in Wheaton or Banks, the Court upheld the reporter\u2019s copy-\n right interest in several explanatory materials that the reporter had\n created himself because they came from an author who had no author-\n ity to speak with the force of law.\n    The animating principle behind the government edicts doctrine is\n that no one can own the law. The doctrine gives effect to that principle\n in the copyright context through construction of the statutory term\n \u201cauthor.\u201d For purposes of the Copyright Act, judges cannot be the \u201cau-\n thor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capacity\u201d as lawmak-\n ers. Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. Because legislators, like judges, have\n the authority to make law, it follows that they, too, cannot be \u201cau-\n thors.\u201d And, as with judges, the doctrine applies to whatever work\n legislators perform in their capacity as legislators, including explana-\n tory and procedural materials they create in the discharge of their leg-\n islative duties. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not copy-\n rightable. First, the author of the annotations qualifies as a legislator.\n Under the Copyright Act, the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the annotations is the\n Commission, 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b), which functions as an arm of the\n Georgia Legislature in producing the annotations. Second, the Com-\n mission creates the annotations in the discharge of its legislative du-\n ties. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (c) Georgia argues that excluding the OCGA annotations from copy-\n right protection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. First, it\n notes that \u00a7101 lists \u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible\n for copyright protection. That provision, however, refers only to \u201can-\n notations . . . which . . . represent an original work of authorship.\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (Emphasis added.) Georgia\u2019s annotations do not fit that description\n  because they are prepared by a legislative body that cannot be deemed\n  the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works it creates in its official capacity. Second,\n  Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact that the Act excludes\n  from copyright protection works prepared by Federal Government of-\n  ficials, without establishing a similar rule for State officials. \u00a7\u00a7101,\n  105. That rule, however, applies to all federal officials, regardless of\n  the nature and scope of their duties. It does not suggest an intent to\n  displace the much narrower government edits doctrine with respect to\n  the States.\n     Moving on from the text, Georgia invokes what it views as the offi-\n  cial position of the Copyright Office, as reflected in the Compendium\n  of U. S. Copyright Office Practices. The Compendium, however, is a\n  non-binding administrative manual and is largely consistent with this\n  Court\u2019s position. Georgia also appeals to copyright policy, but such\n  requests should be addressed to Congress, not the courts.\n     Georgia attempts to frame the government edicts doctrine to focus\n  exclusively on whether a particular work has the force of law. But that\n  understanding cannot be squared with precedent\u2014especially Banks.\n  Moreover, Georgia\u2019s conception of the doctrine as distinguishing be-\n  tween different categories of content with different effects has less of\n  a textual footing than the traditional formulation, which focuses on the\n  identity of the author. Georgia\u2019s characterization of the OCGA anno-\n  tations as non-binding and non-authoritative undersells the practical\n  significance of the annotations to litigants and citizens. And its ap-\n  proach would logically permit States to hide all non-binding judicial\n  and legislative work product\u2014including dissents and legislative his-\n  tory\u2014behind a paywall.

S. C.\n\u00a7102(a). The question in this case is whether that protec-\ntion extends to the annotations contained in Georgia\u2019s\nofficial annotated code.\n   We hold that it does not. Over a century ago, we recog-\nnized a limitation on copyright protection for certain\ngovernment work product, rooted in the Copyright Act\u2019s\n\u201cauthorship\u201d requirement. Under what has been dubbed\nthe government edicts doctrine, officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law cannot be the authors of\u2014and\ntherefore cannot copyright\u2014the works they create in the\ncourse of their official duties.\n   We have previously applied that doctrine to hold that\nnon-binding, explanatory legal materials are not copyright-\nable when created by judges who possess the authority to\nmake and interpret the law. See Banks v. Manchester, 128\nU. S. 244 (1888). We now recognize that the same logic ap-\nplies to non-binding, explanatory legal materials created by\n\f2         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na legislative body vested with the authority to make law.\nBecause Georgia\u2019s annotations are authored by an arm\nof the legislature in the course of its legislative duties, the\ngovernment edicts doctrine puts them outside the reach of\ncopyright protection.\n                              I\n                              A\n   The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the \u201cOfficial\nCode of Georgia Annotated,\u201d or OCGA. The first page of\neach volume of the OCGA boasts the State\u2019s official seal and\nannounces to readers that it is \u201cPublished Under Authority\nof the State.\u201d\n   The OCGA includes the text of every Georgia statute\ncurrently in force, as well as various non-binding supple-\nmentary materials. At issue in this case is a set of annota-\ntions that appear beneath each statutory provision. The\nannotations generally include summaries of judicial deci-\nsions applying a given provision, summaries of any perti-\nnent opinions of the state attorney general, and a list of re-\nlated law review articles and similar reference materials.\nIn addition, the annotations often include editor\u2019s notes\nthat provide information about the origins of the statutory\ntext, such as whether it derives from a particular judicial\ndecision or resembles an older provision that has been con-\nstrued by Georgia courts. See, e.g., OCGA \u00a7\u00a751\u20131\u20131, 53\u20134\u2013\n2 (2019).\n   The OCGA is assembled by a state entity called the Code\nRevision Commission. In 1977, the Georgia Legislature\nestablished the Commission to recodify Georgia law for the\nfirst time in decades. The Commission was (and remains)\ntasked with consolidating disparate bills into a single Code\nfor reenactment by the legislature and contracting with a\nthird party to produce the annotations. A majority of the\nCommission\u2019s 15 members must be members of the Georgia\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

E.\n2d 30, 34 (1979).\n   Each year, the Commission submits its proposed statu-\ntory text and accompanying annotations to the legislature\nfor approval. The legislature then votes to do three things:\n(1) \u201cenact[ ]\u201d the \u201cstatutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws\u201d; (2) \u201cmerge[ ]\u201d the statutory portion \u201cwith\n[the] annotations\u201d; and (3) \u201cpublish[ ]\u201d the final merged\nproduct \u201cby authority of the state\u201d as \u201cthe \u2018Official Code\nof Georgia Annotated.\u2019 \u201d OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20131 (2019); see Code\nRevision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 906 F. 3d\n1229, 1245, 1255 (CA11 2018); Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\n   The annotations in the current OCGA were prepared in\nthe first instance by Matthew Bender & Co., Inc., a division\nof the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a work-for-hire agree-\nment with the Commission. The agreement between Lexis\nand the Commission states that any copyright in the OCGA\nvests exclusively in \u201cthe State of Georgia, acting through\nthe Commission.\u201d App. 567. Lexis and its army of research-\ners perform the lion\u2019s share of the work in drafting the an-\nnotations, but the Commission supervises that work and\nspecifies what the annotations must include in exacting de-\ntail. See 906 F. 3d, at 1243\u20131244; App. 269\u2013278, 286\u2013427\n(Commission specifications). Under the agreement, Lexis\nenjoys the exclusive right to publish, distribute, and sell the\nOCGA. In exchange, Lexis has agreed to limit the price it\nmay charge for the OCGA and to make an unannotated\n\f4         GEORGIA v.

A hard copy of the complete OCGA currently re-\ntails for $412.00.\n                               B\n   Public.Resource.Org (PRO) is a nonprofit organization\nthat aims to facilitate public access to government records\nand legal materials. Without permission, PRO posted a dig-\nital version of the OCGA on various websites, where it could\nbe downloaded by the public without charge. PRO also\ndistributed copies of the OCGA to various organizations\nand Georgia officials.\n   In response, the Commission sent PRO several cease-\nand-desist letters asserting that PRO\u2019s actions constituted\nunlawful copyright infringement. When PRO refused to\nhalt its distribution activities, the Commission sued PRO\non behalf of the Georgia Legislature and the State of Geor-\ngia for copyright infringement. The Commission limited its\nassertion of copyright to the annotations described above; it\ndid not claim copyright in the statutory text or numbering.\nPRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\npublic domain.\n   The District Court sided with the Commission. The\nCourt acknowledged that the annotations in the OCGA pre-\nsented \u201can unusual case because most official codes are not\nannotated and most annotated codes are not official.\u201d Code\nRevision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 244 F. Supp.\n3d 1350, 1356 (ND Ga. 2017). But, ultimately, the Court\nconcluded that the annotations were eligible for copyright\nprotection because they were \u201cnot enacted into law\u201d and\nlacked \u201cthe force of law.\u201d Ibid. In light of that conclusion,\nthe Court granted partial summary judgment to the Com-\nmission and entered a permanent injunction requiring PRO\nto cease its distribution activities and to remove the digital\ncopies of the OCGA from the internet.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Eleventh Circuit reversed. 906 F. 3d 1229. The\nCourt began by reviewing the three 19th-century cases in\nwhich we articulated the government edicts doctrine. See\nWheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834); Banks v. Manchester,\n128 U. S. 244 (1888); Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617\n(1888). The Court understood those cases to establish a\n\u201crule\u201d based on an interpretation of the statutory term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d that \u201cworks created by courts in the performance of\ntheir official duties did not belong to the judges\u201d but instead\nfell \u201cin the public domain.\u201d 906 F. 3d, at 1239. In the\nCourt\u2019s view, that rule \u201cderive[s] from first principles about\nthe nature of law in our democracy.\u201d Ibid. In a democracy,\nthe Court reasoned, \u201cthe People\u201d are \u201cthe constructive au-\nthors\u201d of the law, and judges and legislators are merely\n\u201cdraftsmen . . . exercising delegated authority.\u201d Ibid. The\nCourt therefore deemed the \u201cultimate inquiry\u201d to be\nwhether a work is \u201cattributable to the constructive author-\nship of the People.\u201d Id., at 1242. The Court identified three\nfactors to guide that inquiry: \u201cthe identity of the public offi-\ncial who created the work; the nature of the work; and the\nprocess by which the work was produced.\u201d Id., at 1254. The\nCourt found that each of those factors cut in favor of treat-\ning the OCGA annotations as government edicts authored\nby the People. It therefore rejected the Commission\u2019s asser-\ntion of copyright, vacated the injunction against PRO, and\ndirected that judgment be entered for PRO.\n   We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___ (2019).\n                             II\n  We hold that the annotations in Georgia\u2019s Official Code\nare ineligible for copyright protection, though for reasons\ndistinct from those relied on by the Court of Appeals. A\ncareful examination of our government edicts precedents\nreveals a straightforward rule based on the identity of the\nauthor. Under the government edicts doctrine, judges\u2014\nand, we now confirm, legislators\u2014may not be considered\n\f6         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe \u201cauthors\u201d of the works they produce in the course of\ntheir official duties as judges and legislators. That rule\napplies regardless of whether a given material carries the\nforce of law. And it applies to the annotations here because\nthey are authored by an arm of the legislature in the course\nof its official duties.\n                               A\n   We begin with precedent. The government edicts doc-\ntrine traces back to a trio of cases decided in the 19th cen-\ntury. In this Court\u2019s first copyright case, Wheaton v. Peters,\n8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court\u2019s third Reporter of Decisions,\nWheaton, sued the fourth, Peters, unsuccessfully asserting\na copyright interest in the Justices\u2019 opinions. Id., at 617\n(argument). In Wheaton\u2019s view, the opinions \u201cmust have\nbelonged to some one\u201d because \u201cthey were new, original,\u201d\nand much more \u201celaborate\u201d than law or custom required.\nId., at 615. Wheaton argued that the Justices were the au-\nthors and had assigned their ownership interests to him\nthrough a tacit \u201cgift.\u201d Id., at 614. The Court unanimously\nrejected that argument, concluding that \u201cno reporter has or\ncan have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by\nthis court\u201d and that \u201cthe judges thereof cannot confer on\nany reporter any such right.\u201d Id., at 668 (opinion).\n   That conclusion apparently seemed too obvious to adorn\nwith further explanation, but the Court provided one a half\ncentury later in Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244 (1888).\nThat case concerned whether Wheaton\u2019s state-court coun-\nterpart, the official reporter of the Ohio Supreme Court,\nheld a copyright in the judges\u2019 opinions and several non-\nbinding explanatory materials prepared by the judges. Id.,\nat 249\u2013251. The Court concluded that he did not, explain-\ning that \u201cthe judge who, in his judicial capacity, prepares\nthe opinion or decision, the statement of the case and the\nsyllabus or head note\u201d cannot \u201cbe regarded as their author\nor their proprietor, in the sense of [the Copyright Act].\u201d Id.,\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 253. Pursuant to \u201ca judicial consensus\u201d dating back to\nWheaton, judges could not assert copyright in \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as judges.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S, at 253 (emphasis in original). Rather, \u201c[t]he whole\nwork done by the judges constitutes the authentic exposi-\ntion and interpretation of the law, which, binding every\ncitizen, is free for publication to all.\u201d Ibid. (citing Nash v.\nLathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 6 N. E. 559 (1886)).\n   In a companion case decided later that Term, Callaghan\nv. Myers, 128 U. S. 617 (1888), the Court identified an im-\nportant limiting principle. As in Wheaton and Banks,\nthe Court rejected the claim that an official reporter held a\ncopyright interest in the judges\u2019 opinions. But, resolving an\nissue not addressed in Wheaton and Banks, the Court up-\nheld the reporter\u2019s copyright interest in several explanatory\nmaterials that the reporter had created himself: headnotes,\nsyllabi, tables of contents, and the like. Callaghan, 128\nU. S., at 645, 647. Although these works mirrored the\njudge-made materials rejected in Banks, they came from an\nauthor who had no authority to speak with the force of law.\nBecause the reporter was not a judge, he was free to \u201cob-\ntain[ ] a copyright\u201d for the materials that were \u201cthe result\nof his [own] intellectual labor.\u201d 128 U. S., at 647.\n   These cases establish a straightforward rule: Because\njudges are vested with the authority to make and interpret\nthe law, they cannot be the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works they pre-\npare \u201cin the discharge of their judicial duties.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S., at 253. This rule applies both to binding works (such\nas opinions) and to non-binding works (such as headnotes\nand syllabi). Ibid. It does not apply, however, to works cre-\nated by government officials (or private parties) who lack\nthe authority to make or interpret the law, such as court\nreporters. Compare ibid. with Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 647.\n   The animating principle behind this rule is that no one\ncan own the law. \u201cEvery citizen is presumed to know the\nlaw,\u201d and \u201cit needs no argument to show . . . that all should\n\f8           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhave free access\u201d to its contents. Nash, 142 Mass., at 35, 6\nN. E., at 560 (cited by Banks, 128 U. S., at 253\u2013254). Our\ncases give effect to that principle in the copyright context\nthrough construction of the statutory term \u201cauthor.\u201d Id., at\n253.1 Rather than attempting to catalog the materials\nthat constitute \u201cthe law,\u201d the doctrine bars the officials\nresponsible for creating the law from being considered the\n\u201cauthor[s]\u201d of \u201cwhatever work they perform in their capac-\nity\u201d as lawmakers. Ibid. (emphasis added). Because these\nofficials are generally empowered to make and interpret\nlaw, their \u201cwhole work\u201d is deemed part of the \u201cauthentic ex-\nposition and interpretation of the law\u201d and must be \u201cfree for\npublication to all.\u201d Ibid.\n   If judges, acting as judges, cannot be \u201cauthors\u201d because of\ntheir authority to make and interpret the law, it follows\nthat legislators, acting as legislators, cannot be either.\nCourts have thus long understood the government edicts\ndoctrine to apply to legislative materials. See, e.g., Nash,\n142 Mass., at 35, 6 N. E., at 560 (judicial opinions and stat-\nutes stand \u201con substantially the same footing\u201d for purposes\nof the government edicts doctrine); Howell v. Miller, 91 F.\n129, 130\u2013131, 137\u2013138 (CA6 1898) (Harlan, J., Circuit Jus-\ntice, joined by then-Circuit Judge Taft) (analyzing statutes\nand supplementary materials under Banks and Callaghan\nand concluding that the materials were copyrightable be-\ncause they were prepared by a private compiler).\n   Moreover, just as the doctrine applies to \u201cwhatever work\n[judges] perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d Banks, 128\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Copyright Act of 1790 granted copyright protection to \u201cthe author\n\nand authors\u201d of qualifying works. Act of May 31, 1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 124.\nThis author requirement appears in the current Copyright Act at\n\u00a7102(a), which limits protection to \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d 17\nU. S. C. \u00a7102(a) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7201(a) (copyright \u201cvests ini-\ntially in the author or authors of the work\u201d).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 253, it applies to whatever work legislators per-\nform in their capacity as legislators. That of course includes\nfinal legislation, but it also includes explanatory and proce-\ndural materials legislators create in the discharge of their\nlegislative duties. In the same way that judges cannot be\nthe authors of their headnotes and syllabi, legislators can-\nnot be the authors of (for example) their floor statements,\ncommittee reports, and proposed bills. These materials are\npart of the \u201cwhole work done by [legislators],\u201d so they must\nbe \u201cfree for publication to all.\u201d Ibid.\n   Under our precedents, therefore, copyright does not vest\nin works that are (1) created by judges and legislators (2) in\nthe course of their judicial and legislative duties.\n                              B\n                              1\n   Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not\ncopyrightable. The first step is to examine whether their\npurported author qualifies as a legislator.\n   As we have explained, the annotations were prepared in\nthe first instance by a private company (Lexis) pursuant to\na work-for-hire agreement with Georgia\u2019s Code Revision\nCommission. The Copyright Act therefore deems the Com-\nmission the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the work. 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b).\nAlthough Lexis expends considerable effort preparing the\nannotations, for purposes of copyright that labor redounds\nto the Commission as the statutory author. Georgia agrees\nthat the author is the Commission. Brief for Petitioners 25.\n   The Commission is not identical to the Georgia Legisla-\nture, but functions as an arm of it for the purpose of produc-\ning the annotations. The Commission is created by the leg-\nislature, for the legislature, and consists largely of\nlegislators. The Commission receives funding and staff des-\nignated by law for the legislative branch. Significantly, the\nannotations the Commission creates are approved by the\nlegislature before being \u201cmerged\u201d with the statutory text\n\f10           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand published in the official code alongside that text at the\nlegislature\u2019s direction. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20131; see 906 F. 3d, at\n1245, 1255; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\n   If there were any doubt about the link between the Com-\nmission and the legislature, the Georgia Supreme Court\nhas dispelled it by holding that, under the Georgia Consti-\ntution, \u201cthe work of the Commission; i.e., selecting a pub-\nlisher and contracting for and supervising the codification\nof the laws enacted by the General Assembly, including\ncourt interpretations thereof, is within the sphere of legisla-\ntive authority.\u201d Harrison Co., 244 Ga., at 330, 260 S. E. 2d,\nat 34 (emphasis added). That holding is not limited to the\nCommission\u2019s role in codifying the statutory text. The Com-\nmission\u2019s \u201clegislative authority\u201d specifically includes its\n\u201ccodification of . . . court interpretations\u201d of the State\u2019s laws.\nIbid. Thus, as a matter of state law, the Commission wields\nthe legislature\u2019s authority when it works with Lexis to pro-\nduce the annotations. All of this shows that the Commis-\nsion serves as an extension of the Georgia Legislature in\npreparing and publishing the annotations. And it helps\nexplain why the Commission brought this suit asserting\ncopyright in the annotations \u201con behalf of and for the\nbenefit of \u201d the Georgia Legislature and the State of\nGeorgia. App. 20.2\n                             2\n  The second step is to determine whether the Commission\ncreates the annotations in the \u201cdischarge\u201d of its legislative\n\u201cduties.\u201d Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. It does. Although the\nannotations are not enacted into law through bicameralism\nand presentment, the Commission\u2019s preparation of the an-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE THOMAS does not dispute that the Commission is an exten-\n\nsion of the legislature; he instead faults us for highlighting the multiple\nfeatures of the Commission that make clear that this is so. See post, at\n16 (dissenting opinion).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotations is under Georgia law an act of \u201clegislative author-\nity,\u201d Harrison Co., 244 Ga., at 330, 260 S. E. 2d, at 34, and\nthe annotations provide commentary and resources that the\nlegislature has deemed relevant to understanding its laws.\nGeorgia and JUSTICE GINSBURG emphasize that the anno-\ntations do not purport to provide authoritative explanations\nof the law and largely summarize other materials, such as\njudicial decisions and law review articles. See post, at 3\u20134\n(dissenting opinion). But that does not take them outside\nthe exercise of legislative duty by the Commission and leg-\nislature. Just as we have held that the \u201cstatement of the\ncase and the syllabus or head note\u201d prepared by judges fall\nwithin the \u201cwork they perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d\nBanks, 128 U. S., at 253, so too annotations published by\nlegislators alongside the statutory text fall within the work\nlegislators perform in their capacity as legislators.\n   In light of the Commission\u2019s role as an adjunct to the leg-\nislature and the fact that the Commission authors the\nannotations in the course of its legislative responsibilities,\nthe annotations in Georgia\u2019s Official Code fall within the\ngovernment edicts doctrine and are not copyrightable.\n                               III\n   Georgia resists this conclusion on several grounds. At the\noutset, Georgia advances two arguments for why, in its\nview, excluding the OCGA annotations from copyright\nprotection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. Both\nare unavailing.\n   First, Georgia notes that \u00a7101 of the Act specifically lists\n\u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible for copy-\nright protection. But that provision refers only to \u201cannota-\ntions . . . which . . . represent an original work of author-\nship.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7101 (emphasis added). The whole point\nof the government edicts doctrine is that judges and legis-\nlators cannot serve as authors when they produce works in\ntheir official capacity. While the reference to \u201cannotations\u201d\n\f12        GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin \u00a7101 may help explain why supplemental, explanatory\nmaterials are copyrightable when prepared by a private\nparty, or a non-lawmaking official like the reporter in Cal-\nlaghan, it does not speak to whether those same materials\nare copyrightable when prepared by a judge or a legislator.\nIn the same way that judicial materials are ineligible for\nprotection even though they plainly qualify as \u201c[l]iterary\nworks . . . expressed in words,\u201d ibid., legislative materials\nare ineligible for protection even if they happen to fit the\ndescription of otherwise copyrightable \u201cannotations.\u201d\n  Second, Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact\nthat the Act excludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s]\nprepared by an officer or employee of the United States\nGovernment as part of that person\u2019s official duties\u201d and\ndoes not establish a similar rule for the States. \u00a7101; see\nalso \u00a7105. But the bar on copyright protection for federal\nworks sweeps much more broadly than the government\nedicts doctrine does. That bar applies to works created by\nall federal \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s],\u201d without regard for the\nnature of their position or scope of their authority. What-\never policy reasons might justify the Federal Government\u2019s\ndecision to forfeit copyright protection for its own proprie-\ntary works, that federal rule does not suggest an intent to\ndisplace the much narrower government edicts doctrine\nwith respect to the States. That doctrine does not apply to\nnon-lawmaking officials, leaving States free to assert copy-\nright in the vast majority of expressive works they produce,\nsuch as those created by their universities, libraries,\ntourism offices, and so on.\n  More generally, Georgia suggests that we should resist\napplying our government edicts precedents to the OCGA\nannotations because our 19th-century forebears inter-\npreted the statutory term author by reference to \u201cpublic\npolicy\u201d\u2014an approach that Georgia believes is incongruous\nwith the \u201cmodern era\u201d of statutory interpretation.

United States, 335 U. S. 1, 16 (1948)). A century of cases\nhave rooted the government edicts doctrine in the word \u201cau-\nthor,\u201d and Congress has repeatedly reused that term with-\nout abrogating the doctrine.

Copyright Office Practices\n(Compendium). But, as Georgia concedes, the Compen-\ndium is a non-binding administrative manual that at most\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE THOMAS disputes the applicability of the Helsinn Healthcare\n\npresumption because States have asserted copyright in statutory anno-\ntations over the years notwithstanding our government edicts prece-\ndents. Post, at 11\u201312. In JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s view, those assertions prove\nthat our precedents could not have provided clear enough guidance for\nCongress to incorporate. But that inference from state behavior proves\ntoo much. The same study cited by JUSTICE THOMAS to support a practice\nof claiming copyright in non-binding annotations also reports that \u201cmany\nstates claim copyright interest in their primary law materials,\u201d including\nstatutes and regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of Copyrights in\nPrimary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertainment L. J. 81, 109\n(2000) (emphasis added). JUSTICE THOMAS concedes that such assertions\nare plainly foreclosed by our government edicts precedents. Post, at 4.\nThat interested parties have pursued ambitious readings of our prece-\ndents does not mean those precedents are incapable of providing mean-\ningful guidance to us or to Congress.\n\f14         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nmerits deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S.\n134 (1944). That means we must follow it only to the extent\nit has the \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d Id., at 140. Because our\nprecedents answer the question before us, we find any com-\npeting guidance in the Compendium unpersuasive.\n   In any event, the Compendium is largely consistent with\nour decision. Drawing on Banks, it states that, \u201c[a]s a mat-\nter of longstanding public policy, the U. S. Copyright Office\nwill not register a government edict that has been issued by\nany state, local, or territorial government, including legis-\nlative enactments, judicial decisions, administrative rul-\nings, public ordinances, or similar types of official legal ma-\nterials.\u201d Compendium \u00a7313.6(C)(2) (rev. 3d ed. 2017)\n(emphasis added). And, under Banks, what counts as a\n\u201csimilar\u201d material depends on what kind of officer created\nthe material (i.e., a judge) and whether the officer created\nit in the course of official (i.e., judicial) duties. See Compen-\ndium \u00a7313.6(C)(2) (quoting Banks, 128 U. S., at 253, for the\nproposition that copyright cannot vest \u201cin the products of\nthe labor done by judicial officers in the discharge of their\njudicial duties\u201d).\n   The Compendium goes on to observe that \u201cthe Office may\nregister annotations that summarize or comment upon\nlegal materials . . . unless the annotations themselves have\nthe force of law.\u201d Compendium \u00a7313.6(C)(2). But that\nbroad statement\u2014true of annotations created by officials\nsuch as court reporters that lack the authority to make or\ninterpret the law\u2014does not engage with the critical issue of\nannotations created by judges or legislators in their official\ncapacities. Because the Compendium does not address that\nquestion and otherwise echoes our government edicts prec-\nedents, it is of little relevance here.\n   Georgia also appeals to the overall purpose of the Copy-\nright Act to promote the creation and dissemination of\ncreative works. Georgia submits that, without copyright\nprotection, Georgia and many other States will be unable to\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

That\nappeal to copyright policy, however, is addressed to the\nwrong forum. As Georgia acknowledges, \u201c[I]t is generally\nfor Congress, not the courts, to decide how best to pursue\nthe Copyright Clause\u2019s objectives.\u201d Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537\nU. S. 186, 212 (2003). And that principle requires adher-\nence to precedent when, as here, we have construed the\nstatutory text and \u201ctossed [the ball] into Congress\u2019s court,\nfor acceptance or not as that branch elects.\u201d Kimble, 576\nU. S., at 456.\n   Turning to our government edicts precedents, Georgia in-\nsists that they can and should be read to focus exclusively\non whether a particular work has \u201cthe force of law.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 32 (capitalization deleted). JUSTICE THOMAS\nappears to endorse the same view. See post, at 4. But that\nframing has multiple flaws.\n   Most obviously, it cannot be squared with the reasoning\nor results of our cases\u2014especially Banks. Banks, following\nWheaton and the \u201cjudicial consensus\u201d it inspired, denied\ncopyright protection to judicial opinions without excepting\nconcurrences and dissents that carry no legal force. 128\nU. S., at 253 (emphasis deleted). As every judge learns the\nhard way, \u201ccomments in [a] dissenting opinion\u201d about legal\nprinciples and precedents \u201care just that: comments in a dis-\nsenting opinion.\u201d Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449\nU. S. 166, 177, n. 10 (1980). Yet such comments are covered\nby the government edicts doctrine because they come from\nan official with authority to make and interpret the law.\n   Indeed, Banks went even further and withheld copyright\nprotection from headnotes and syllabi produced by judges.\n128 U. S., at 253. Surely these supplementary materials do\nnot have the force of law, yet they are covered by the doc-\ntrine. The simplest explanation is the one Banks provided:\nThese non-binding works are not copyrightable because of\nwho creates them\u2014judges acting in their judicial capacity.\n\f16           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nSee ibid.\n  The same goes for non-binding legislative materials pro-\nduced by legislative bodies acting in a legislative capacity.\nThere is a broad array of such works ranging from floor\nstatements to proposed bills to committee reports. Under\nthe logic of Georgia\u2019s \u201cforce of law\u201d test, States would own\nsuch materials and could charge the public for access to\nthem.\n  Furthermore, despite Georgia\u2019s and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\npurported concern for the text of the Copyright Act, their\nconception of the government edicts doctrine has less of a\ntextual footing than the traditional formulation. The tex-\ntual basis for the doctrine is the Act\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d require-\nment, which unsurprisingly focuses on\u2014the author.\nJUSTICE THOMAS urges us to dig deeper to \u201cthe root\u201d of our\ngovernment edicts precedents. Post, at 5. But, in our view,\nthe text is the root. The Court long ago interpreted the\nword \u201cauthor\u201d to exclude officials empowered to speak with\nthe force of law, and Congress has carried that meaning for-\nward in multiple iterations of the Copyright Act. This tex-\ntual foundation explains why the doctrine distinguishes be-\ntween some authors (who are empowered to speak with the\nforce of law) and others (who are not). Compare Callaghan,\n128 U. S., at 647, with Banks, 128 U. S., at 253. But the\nAct\u2019s reference to \u201cauthorship\u201d provides no basis for Geor-\ngia\u2019s rule distinguishing between different categories of\ncontent with different effects.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Instead of accepting our predecessors\u2019 textual reasoning at face value,\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS conjures a trinity of alternative \u201corigin[s] and justifica-\ntion[s]\u201d for the government edicts doctrine that the Court might have had\nin mind. See post, at 5\u20137. Without committing to one or all of these\npossibilities, JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that each would yield a rule that\nrequires federal courts to pick out the subset of judicial and legislative\nmaterials that independently carry the force of law. But a Court moti-\nvated by JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s three-fold concerns might just as easily have\nread them as supporting a rule that prevents the officials responsible for\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Imagine a Georgia citizen in-\nterested in learning his legal rights and duties. If he reads\nthe economy-class version of the Georgia Code available\nonline, he will see laws requiring political candidates to pay\nhefty qualification fees (with no indigency exception), crim-\ninalizing broad categories of consensual sexual conduct,\nand exempting certain key evidence in criminal trials\nfrom standard evidentiary limitations\u2014with no hint\nthat important aspects of those laws have been held uncon-\nstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court. See OCGA\n\u00a7\u00a721\u20132\u2013131, 16\u20136\u20132, 16\u20136\u201318, 16\u201315\u20139 (available at\nwww.legis.ga.gov). Meanwhile, first-class readers with\naccess to the annotations will be assured that these laws\nare, in crucial respects, unenforceable relics that the legis-\nlature has not bothered to narrow or repeal. See \u00a7\u00a721\u20132\u2013\n131, 16\u20136\u20132, 16\u20136\u201318, 16\u201315\u20139 (available at https://store.\nlexisnexis.com/products/official-code-of-georgia-annotated-\nskuSKU6647 for $412.00).\n   If everything short of statutes and opinions were copy-\nrightable, then States would be free to offer a whole range\nof premium legal works for those who can afford the extra\nbenefit. A State could monetize its entire suite of legislative\nhistory. With today\u2019s digital tools, States might even\nlaunch a subscription or pay-per-law service.\n   There is no need to assume inventive or nefarious behav-\nior for these concerns to become a reality. Unlike other\nforms of intellectual property, copyright protection is both\ninstant and automatic. It vests as soon as a work is cap-\ntured in a tangible form, triggering a panoply of exclusive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncreating binding materials from qualifying as an \u201cauthor.\u201d Regardless,\nit is more \u201c[ ]consistent with the judicial role\u201d to apply the reasoning and\nresults the Court voted on and committed to writing than to speculate\nabout what practical considerations our predecessors \u201cmay have had\n. . . in mind,\u201d what history \u201cmay [have] suggest[ed],\u201d or what constitu-\ntional concerns \u201cmay have animated\u201d our government edicts precedents.\nIbid.\n\f18        GEORGIA v.

If Georgia were correct, then unless a State took the\naffirmative step of transferring its copyrights to the public\ndomain, all of its judges\u2019 and legislators\u2019 non-binding legal\nworks would be copyrighted.

The less bold among us\nwould have to think twice before using official legal works\nthat illuminate the law we are all presumed to know and\nunderstand.\n  Thankfully, there is a clear path forward that avoids\nthese concerns\u2014the one we are already on. Instead of ex-\namining whether given material carries \u201cthe force of law,\u201d\nwe ask only whether the author of the work is a judge or a\nlegislator.

And, after straining to conclude\nthat the Georgia Code Revision Commission (Commission)\nis an arm of the Georgia Legislature, ante, at 9\u201310, the ma-\njority concludes that Georgia cannot hold a copyright in the\nannotations that are included as part of the Official Code of\nGeorgia Annotated (OCGA). This ruling will likely come as\na shock to the 25 other jurisdictions\u201422 States, 2 Territo-\nries, and the District of Columbia\u2014that rely on arrange-\nments similar to Georgia\u2019s to produce annotated codes. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae 15, and\nApp. to id., at 1. Perhaps these jurisdictions all overlooked\nthis Court\u2019s purportedly clear guidance. Or perhaps the\nwidespread use of these arrangements indicates that to-\nday\u2019s decision extends the government edicts doctrine to a\nnew context, rather than simply \u201cconfirm[ing]\u201d what the\nprecedents have always held.

Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court first\nregarded it as self-evident that judicial opinions cannot be\ncopyrighted either by the judges who signed them or by a\nreporter under whose auspices they are published. Con-\ngress provided that, in return for a salary of $1,000, the Re-\nporter of Decisions for this Court would prepare reports\nconsisting of judicial opinions and additional materials\nsummarizing the cases. Id., at 614, 617 (argument).\nWheaton, one of this Court\u2019s earliest Reporters, argued that\nhe owned a copyright for the entirety of his reports. He con-\ntended that he had \u201cacquired the right to the opinions by\njudges\u2019 gift\u201d once they became a part of his volume. Id., at\n614 (same). The Court ultimately remanded on the ques-\ntion whether Wheaton had complied with the Copyright\nAct\u2019s procedural requirements. Id., at 667\u2013668. In doing\nso, it observed in dicta that \u201cthe court [was] unanimously of\n[the] opinion, that no reporter has or can have any copy-\nright in the written opinions delivered by this court; and\nthat the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any\nsuch right.\u201d Id., at 668.\n   Fifty-four years later, the Court returned to the same\nsubject, suggesting a doctrinal basis for the rule that judi-\ncial opinions and certain closely related materials cannot be\ncopyrighted. In Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244 (1888),\nthe state-authorized publisher of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecisions, Banks & Brothers, sued a competing publisher\nfor copyright infringement. The competing publisher repro-\nduced portions from Banks\u2019 reports, including Ohio Su-\npreme Court decisions, statements of the cases, and syllabi,\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

This Court held that these materials were\nnot the proper subject of copyright. In reaching that con-\nclusion, the Court grounded its analysis in its interpreta-\ntion of the word \u201cauthor\u201d in the Copyright Act. It anchored\nthis interpretation in the \u201cpublic policy\u201d that \u201cthe judge\nwho, in his judicial capacity, prepares the opinion or deci-\nsion [and other materials]\u201d is not \u201cregarded as their author\nor their proprietor, in the sense of [the Copyright Act], so as\nto be able to confer any title by assignment.\u201d Banks, 128\nU. S., at 253. The Court supported this conclusion by stat-\ning that \u201cthere has always been a judicial consensus . . .\nthat no copyright could[,] under the statutes passed by Con-\ngress, be secured in the products of the labor done by judi-\ncial officers in the discharge of their judicial duties.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis deleted). And the Court observed that this rule\nreflected the view that the \u201cauthentic exposition and inter-\npretation of the law . . . is free for publication to all,\u201d which\nin turn prevents a judge from qualifying as an author. Ibid.\n   Importantly, the Court also briefly discussed whether the\nState of Ohio could directly hold the copyright. In answer-\ning this question, the Court did not suggest that States\nwere categorically prohibited from holding copyrights as\nauthors or assignees. Instead, the Court simply noted that\nthe State fell outside the scope of the Act because it was not\na \u201cresident\u201d or \u201ccitizen of the United States,\u201d as then re-\nquired by statute, and because it did not meet other statu-\ntory criteria. Ibid. The Court felt it necessary to observe,\nhowever, that \u201c[w]hether the State could take out a copy-\nright for itself, or could enjoy the benefit of one taken out\nby an individual for it, as the assignee of a citizen of the\nUnited States or a resident therein, who should be the au-\nthor of a book, is a question not involved in the present case,\nand we refrain from considering it.\u201d Ibid.\n   Finally, in Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617 (1888), the\n\f4         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt addressed the limits of the government edicts doc-\ntrine. In that case, the Court settled another dispute be-\ntween a publisher of court decisions and an alleged in-\nfringer. The plaintiff purchased the proprietary rights to\nthe reports prepared by the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s re-\nporter of decisions, Freeman, including the copyright to the\nreports. Unlike in Banks, these reports also contained ma-\nterial authored by Freeman. Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 645.\nThe alleged infringers copied the judicial decisions and\nFreeman\u2019s materials. In finding for the plaintiff, this Court\nreiterated that \u201cthere can be no copyright in the opinions of\nthe judges, or in the work done by them in their official ca-\npacity as judges.\u201d Id., at 647 (citing Banks, 128 U. S. 244).\nBut the Court concluded that \u201cno [similar] ground of public\npolicy\u201d justified denying a state official a copyright\n\u201ccover[ing] the matter which is the result of his intellectual\nlabor.\u201d Callaghan, 128 U. S., at 647.\n                             II\n   These precedents establish that judicial opinions cannot\nbe copyrighted. But they do not exclude from copyright pro-\ntection notes that are prepared by an official court reporter\nand published together with the reported opinions. There\nis no apparent reason why the same logic would not apply\nto statutes and regulations. Thus, it must follow from our\nprecedents that statutes and regulations cannot be copy-\nrighted, but accompanying notes lacking legal force can be.\nSee Howell v. Miller, 91 F. 129 (CA6 1898) (Harlan, J.) (ex-\nplaining that, under Banks and Callaghan, annotations to\nMichigan statutes could be copyrighted).\n                               A\n  It is fair to say that the Court\u2019s 19th-century decisions do\nnot provide any extended explanation of the basis for the\ngovernment edicts doctrine.

But the contours of the rule were\nfar from clear, and to understand the scope of the doctrine,\nwe must explore its underlying rationale.\n   In my view, the majority\u2019s uncritical extrapolation of\nprecedent is inconsistent with the judicial role. An unwill-\ningness to examine the root of a precedent has led to the\nsprouting of many noxious weeds that distort the meaning\nof the Constitution and statutes alike. Although we have\nnot been asked to revisit these precedents, it behooves us to\nexplore the origin of and justification for them, especially\nwhen we are asked to apply their rule for the first time in\nover 130 years.\n   The Court\u2019s precedents suggest three possible grounds\nsupporting their conclusion. In Banks, the Court referred\nto the meaning of the term \u201cauthor\u201d in copyright law. While\nthe Court did not develop this argument, it is conceivable\nthat the contemporaneous public meaning of the term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d was narrower in the copyright context than in ordi-\nnary speech. At the time this Court decided Banks, the\nCopyright Act provided protection for books, maps, prints,\nengravings, musical and dramatic compositions, photo-\ngraphs, and works of art.1 Judicial opinions differ markedly\nfrom these works. Books, for instance, express the thoughts\nof their authors. They typically have no power beyond the\nability of their words to influence readers, and they usually\nare published at private expense. Judicial opinions, on the\nother hand, do not simply express the thoughts of the\njudges who write or endorse them. Instead, they elaborate\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See 1 Stat. 124; 2 Stat. 171; ch. 16, 4 Stat. 436; 11 Stat. 138\u2013139; 13\n\nStat. 540; 16 Stat. 212.\n\f6          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nand apply rules of law that, in turn, represent the imple-\nmentation of the will of the people. Unlike other copyright-\nable works of authorship, judicial opinions have binding le-\ngal effect, and they are produced and issued at public\nexpense. Moreover, copyright law understands an author\nto be one whose work will be encouraged by the grant of an\nexclusive right. See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,\n579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6). But judges, when\nacting in an official capacity, do not fit that description. The\nCourt in Banks may have had these differences in mind\nwhen it concluded that a judge fell outside the scope of the\nterm \u201cauthor.\u201d 128 U. S., at 253.\n   History may also suggest a narrower meaning of \u201cauthor\u201d\nin the copyright context. In England, at least as far back as\n1666, courts and commentators agreed \u201cthat the property\nof all law books is in the king, because he pays the judges\nwho pronounce the law.\u201d G. Curtis, Law of Copyright 130\n(1847); see also Banks & Bros. v. West Publishing Co., 27 F.\n50, 57 (CC Minn. 1886) (citing English cases and treatises\nand concluding that \u201cEnglish courts generally sustain the\ncrown\u2019s proprietary rights in judicial opinions\u201d). Black-\nstone described this as a \u201cprerogative copyrigh[t],\u201d explain-\ning that \u201c[t]he king, as the executive magistrate, has the\nright of promulging to the people all acts of state and gov-\nernment. This gives him the exclusive privilege of printing,\nat his own press, or that of his grantees, all acts of parlia-\nment, proclamations, and orders of council.\u201d 2 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 410 (1766)\n(emphasis deleted); see also Wheaton, 8 Pet., at 659\u2013660.\nThis history helps to explain the dearth of cases permitting\nindividuals to obtain copyrights in judicial opinions. But\nunder the Constitution, sovereignty lies with the people,\nnot a king. See The Federalist No. 22, p. 152 (C. Rossiter\ned. 1961); id., No. 39, at 241. The English historical prac-\ntice, when superimposed on the Constitution\u2019s recognition\nthat sovereignty resides in the people, helps to explain the\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

S., at 253.\n   Finally, concerns of fair notice, often recognized by this\nCourt\u2019s precedents as an important component of due\nprocess, also may have animated the reasoning of these\n19th-century cases. As one court put it, \u201c[t]he decisions and\nopinions of the justices are the authorized expositions and\ninterpretations of the laws, which are binding upon all the\ncitizens. . . . Every citizen is presumed to know the law thus\ndeclared, and it needs no argument to show that justice re-\nquires that all should have free access to the opinions.\u201d\nNash v. Lathrop, 142 Mass. 29, 35, 6 N. E. 559, 560 (1886)\n(cited in Banks, 128 U. S., at 253\u2013254); see also American\nSoc. for Testing and Materials v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc.,\n896 F. 3d 437, 458\u2013459 (CADC 2018) (Katsas, J., concur-\nring).\n                               B\n   Allowing annotations to be copyrighted does not run afoul\nof any of these possible justifications for the government\nedicts doctrine. First, unlike judicial opinions and statutes,\nthese annotations do not even purport to embody the will of\nthe people because they are not law. The General Assembly\nof Georgia has made abundantly clear through a variety of\nprovisions that the annotations do not create any binding\nobligations. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20137 states that \u201c[a]ll historical cita-\ntions, title and chapter analyses, and notes set out in this\nCode are given for the purpose of convenient reference and\ndo not constitute part of the law.\u201d Section 1\u20131\u20131 further\nprovides that \u201c[t]he statutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws . . . is enacted and shall have the effect of stat-\nutes enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia. The stat-\nutory portion of such codification shall be merged with an-\nnotations . . . and other materials . . . and shall be published\nby authority of the state.\u201d Thus, although the materials\n\f8         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cmerge\u201d prior to publication in the \u201cofficial\u201d code, the very\nprovision calling for that merger makes clear that the an-\nnotations serve as commentary, not law.\n   As additional evidence that the annotations do not repre-\nsent the will of the people, the General Assembly does not\nenact statutory annotations under its legislative power.\nSee Ga. Const., Art. III, \u00a71, \u00b61 (vesting the legislative power\nin the General Assembly). To enact state law, Georgia em-\nploys a process of bicameralism and presentment similar to\nthat embodied in the United States Constitution. See Ga.\nConst., Art. III, \u00a75; Art. V, \u00a72, \u00b64. The annotations do not\ngo through this process, a fact that even the majority must\nacknowledge. Ante, at 10; Ga. S. 52, Reg. Sess., \u00a754(b)\n(2019\u20132020) (\u201cAnnotations . . . except as otherwise provided\nin the Code . . . are not enacted as statutes by the provisions\nof this Act\u201d).\n   Second, unlike judges and legislators, the creators of an-\nnotations are incentivized by the copyright laws to produce\na desirable product that will eventually earn them a profit.\nAnd though the Commission may require Lexis to follow\nstrict guidelines, the independent synthesis, analysis, and\ncreative drafting behind the annotations makes them anal-\nogous to other copyrightable materials. See Brief for Mat-\nthew Bender & Co., Inc., as Amicus Curiae 4\u20137.\n   Lastly, the annotations do not impede fair notice of the\nlaws. As just stated, the annotations do not carry the bind-\ning force of law. They simply summarize independent\nsources of legal information and consolidate them in one\nplace. Thus, OCGA annotations serve a similar function to\nother copyrighted research tools provided by private parties\nsuch as the American Law Reports and Westlaw, which also\ncontain information of great \u201cpractical significance.\u201d Ante,\nat 17. Compare, e.g., OCGA \u00a734\u20139\u2013260 (annotation for Cho\nCarwash Property, L. L. C. v. Everett, 326 Ga. App. 6, 755\nS. E. 2d 823 (2014)) with Ga. Code Ann. \u00a734\u20139\u2013260\n(Westlaw\u2019s annotation for the same).\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Ante, at 17.\nThat is simply incorrect. As the majority tacitly concedes,\na person seeking information about changes in Georgia\nstatutory law can find that information by consulting the\noriginal source for the change in the law\u2019s status\u2014the court\ndecisions themselves. See ante, at 17. The inability to ac-\ncess the OCGA merely deprives a researcher of one specific\ntool, not to the underlying factual or legal information sum-\nmarized in that tool. See also post, at 4 (GINSBURG, J., dis-\nsenting).2\n                            C\n  The text of the Copyright Act supports my reading of the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The majority contends that, rather than seeking to understand the\n\norigins of our precedents, we should simply accept the text of the opinions\nthat the Justices \u201cvoted on and committed to writing.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317,\nn. 4. But that begs the question: What does the text of the relevant opin-\nions tell us? The answer is not much. It is precisely this lack of explica-\ntion that makes it necessary to explore the \u201cjudicial consensus\u201d and pub-\nlic policy referred to in Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244, 253 (1888).\nInstead, the majority attempts to dissect the language of our prior opin-\nions in the same way it would interpret a statute, an approach we have\nrepeatedly cautioned against. See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509\nU. S. 502, 515 (1993); Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 341 (1979).\nThe proper approach is to \u201cread general language in judicial opinions . . .\nas referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances\nthen before the Court and not referring to quite different circumstances\nthat the Court was not then considering.\u201d Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U. S.\n419, 424 (2004); see also Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399 (1821)\n(Marshall, C. J., for the Court) (\u201c[G]eneral expressions, in every opinion,\nare to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions\nare used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought\nnot to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is\npresented for decision\u201d).\n\f10          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprecedents.3 Specifically, there are four indications in the\ntext of the Copyright Act that the OCGA annotations are\ncopyrightable. As an initial matter, the Act does not define\nthe word \u201cauthor,\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7101, or make any reference\nto the government edicts doctrine. Accordingly, the term\n\u201cauthor\u201d itself does not shed any light on whether the doc-\ntrine covers statutory annotations. Second, while the Act\nexcludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s] prepared by an\nofficer or employee of the United States Government as part\nof that person\u2019s official duties,\u201d \u00a7101; see also \u00a7105, the Act\ncontains no similar prohibition against works of state gov-\nernments or works prepared at their behest. \u201cCongress\u2019 use\nof explicit language in one provision cautions against infer-\nring the same limitation\u201d elsewhere in the statute. State\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n580 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Val-\nladolid, 565 U. S. 207, 216 (2012). Third, the Act specifi-\ncally notes that annotations are copyrightable derivative\nworks. \u00a7101. Here, again, the Act does not expressly ex-\nclude from copyright protection annotations created either\nby the State or at the State\u2019s request. Fourth, the Act pro-\nvides that an author may hold a copyright in \u201cmaterial con-\ntributed\u201d in a derivative work, \u201cas distinguished from the\npreexisting material employed in the work.\u201d \u00a7103(b); see\nalso Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.,\n499 U. S. 340, 359 (1991). These aspects of the statutory\ntext, taken together, further support the conclusion that the\nOCGA annotations are copyrightable.\n   For all these reasons, I would conclude that, as with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the majority explains, ante, at 9, the annotations were created as\n\npart of a work-for-hire agreement between the Commission and Lexis.\nSee 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b). Because no party disputes the validity of the\ncontract, I express no opinion regarding whether the contract established\nan employer/employee relationship or whether the Commission may be\nconsidered a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7201(b).\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

In\nits view, the Court in Banks held that judges are not \u201cau-\nthors\u201d within the scope of the Copyright Act for \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as judges,\u201d 128 U. S., at\n253, so the same must be true for legislators, see ante, at 8\u2013\n9. Accordingly, works created by legislators in their legis-\nlative capacity are not \u201coriginal works of authorship,\u201d \u00a7102,\nand therefore cannot be copyrighted. This argument is\nflawed in multiple respects.\n                               A\n   Most notably, the majority\u2019s textual analysis hinges on\naccepting that its construction of \u201cauthorship,\u201d i.e., all\nworks produced in a judge\u2019s or legislator\u2019s official capacity,\nwas so well established by our 19th-century precedents that\nCongress incorporated it into the multiple revisions of the\nCopyright Act. See ante, at 12\u201313. Such confidence is ques-\ntionable, to say the least.\n   The majority\u2019s understanding of the government edicts\ndoctrine seems to have been lost on dozens of States and\nTerritories, as well as the lower courts in this case. As al-\nready stated, the 25 jurisdictions with official annotated\ncodes apparently did not view this Court\u2019s precedents as es-\ntablishing the \u201cofficial duties\u201d definition of authorship. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae.4 And if\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 According to one study published in 2000, approximately half of\n\nStates owned copyright in official state statutory compilations, court re-\nports, or administrative regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of\nCopyrights in Primary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertain-\nment L. J. 81, 83, 97\u2013105 (2000). The majority attempts to undermine\nthis study by emphasizing that some of these States owned copyright in\nprimary law materials. Ante, at 13, n. 3. This misunderstands the point.\n\f12          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cour precedents answer the question\u201d so clearly, ante, at 14,\none wonders why the Eleventh Circuit reached its conclu-\nsion in such a roundabout fashion. Rather than following\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cstraightforward\u201d path, ante, at 5, the Elev-\nenth Circuit looked to the \u201czone of indeterminacy at the\nfrontier between edicts that carry the force of law and\nthose that do not\u201d to determine whether the annotations\nwere \u201csufficiently law-like\u201d to be \u201cconstructively authored\nby the People.\u201d Code Revision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Re-\nsource.Org, Inc., 906 F. 3d 1229, 1233, 1242, 1243 (2018).\nThe District Court likewise does not appear to have viewed\nthe question as well settled. In a cursory analysis, it deter-\nmined that the annotations were copyrightable based on\nCallaghan. Code Revision Comm\u2019n v. Public.Resource.Org,\nInc., 244 F. Supp. 3d 1350, 1356 (ND Ga. 2017). It is risible\nto presume that Congress had knowledge of and incorpo-\nrated a \u201csettled\u201d meaning that eluded a multitude of States\nand Territories, as well as at least four Article III judges.\nAnte, at 13. Cf. Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586\nU. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019) (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n  This presumption of congressional knowledge also pro-\nvides the basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the anno-\ntations are not \u201coriginal works of authorship.\u201d See ante, at\n11\u201312 (discussing \u00a7101). Stripped of the fiction that this\nCourt\u2019s 19th-century precedents clearly demonstrated that\n\u201cauthorship\u201d encompassed all works performed as part of a\nlegislator\u2019s duties, the majority\u2019s textual argument fails.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI do not claim that this evidence demonstrates that the States neces-\nsarily interpreted the government edicts doctrine correctly. I merely\npoint out that these divergent practices seriously undercut the majority\u2019s\nclaim that its interpretation of \u201cauthorship\u201d was well settled and univer-\nsally understood. On this score, the majority has no answer but to insin-\nuate that the lawmakers of over half the Nation\u2019s jurisdictions disre-\ngarded federal law and the Constitution to pursue their own agendas in\nthe face of supposedly clear precedent.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    13\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The majority does not confront this criticism head on. In-\nstead, it simply repeats, without any further elaboration,\nits unsupported conclusion that \u201c[t]he Court long ago inter-\npreted the word \u2018author\u2019 to exclude officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law, and Congress has carried that\nmeaning forward in multiple iterations of the Copyright\nAct.\u201d Ante, at 16. This wave of the \u201cmagic wand of ipse\ndixit\u201d does nothing to strengthen the majority\u2019s argument,\nand in fact only serves to underscore its weakness. United\nStates v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 77 (1984) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting).5\n                                B\n  In addition to its textual deficiencies, the majority\u2019s un-\nderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedents fails to account for\nthe critical differences between the role that judicial opin-\nions play in expounding upon the law compared to that of\nstatutes. The majority finds it meaningful, for instance,\nthat Banks prohibited dissents and concurrences from be-\ning copyrighted, even though they carry no legal force.\nAnte, at 15. At an elementary level, it is true that the judg-\nment is the only part of a judicial decision that has legal\neffect. But it blinks reality to ignore that every word of a\njudicial opinion\u2014whether it is a majority, a concurrence, or\na dissent\u2014expounds upon the law in ways that do not map\nneatly on to the legislative function. Setting aside sum-\nmary decisions, the reader of a judicial opinion will always\ngain critical insight into the reasoning underlying a judicial\nholding by reading all opinions in their entirety. Under-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority\u2019s approach is also hard to reconcile with the recognition\n\nin Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), that annotations prepared by the\nReporter of Decisions could be copyrighted. Wheaton was paid a salary\nof $1,000, and it is difficult to say whether this salary funded his work\non the opinions or his work on the annotations. See id., at 614, 617 (ar-\ngument).\n\f14           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nstanding the reasoning that animates the rule in turn pro-\nvides pivotal insight into how the law will likely be applied\nin future judicial opinions.6 Thus, deprived of access to ju-\ndicial opinions, individuals cannot access the primary, and\ntherefore best, source of information for the meaning of the\nlaw.7 And as true as that is today, access to these opinions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 For instance, this Court has not overruled Lemon v.

American Humanist Assn., 588\nU. S. ___ (2019), to understand the markedly different way that this prec-\nedent functions in our current jurisprudence compared to when it was\nfirst decided. Moreover, sometimes a separate writing takes on canonical\nstatus, like Justice Jackson\u2019s concurrence regarding the executive power\nin Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 634\u2013638\n(1952) (opinion concurring in judgment and opinion of the Court); see\nalso Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 360\u2013361 (1967) (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring) (reasonable expectation of privacy Fourth Amendment test).\nStill other times, the reasoning in an opinion for less than a majority of\nthe Court provides the explicit basis for a later majority\u2019s holding. See,\ne.g., McKinney v. Arizona, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 5) (dis-\ncussing Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 612 (2002) (Scalia J., concur-\nring)); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.

See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a72\u20134\u2013203(1)(c) (2019); Iowa Code \u00a74.6(3)\n(2019); Minn. Stat. \u00a7645.16(7) (2018); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a712\u20132A\u201320(C)(2)\n(2019); N. D.

Under the major-\nity\u2019s view, any one of these commissions or counsels could\npotentially be reclassified as an \u201cadjunct to the legislature.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. But the majority\u2019s test for ascertaining the true\nnature of these commissions raises far more questions than\nit answers.\n   The majority lists a number of factors\u2014including the\nCommission\u2019s membership and funding, how the annota-\ntions become part of the OCGA, and descriptions of the\nCommission from court cases\u2014to support its conclusion\nthat the Commission is really part of the legislature. See\nante, at 9\u201310. But it does not specify whether these factors\nare exhaustive or illustrative and, if the latter, what other\nfactors may be important. The majority also does not spec-\nify whether some factors weigh more heavily than others\nwhen deciding whether to deem an oversight body a legis-\nlative adjunct.\n   And even when the majority does list concrete factors,\npivotal guidance remains lacking. For example, the major-\nity finds it meaningful that 9 out of the Commission\u2019s 15\nmembers are legislators. Ante, at 9; see OCGA \u00a728\u20139\u20132\n(noting that the other members of the Commission include\nthe State\u2019s Lieutenant Governor, a judge, a district attor-\nney, and three other state bar members). But how many\nlegislative members are needed for a commission to become\na legislative adjunct? The majority provides no answers to\nany of these questions.\n                         *     *    *\n     The majority\u2019s rule will leave in the lurch the many\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

Perhaps, to the detriment\nof all, many States will stop producing annotated codes\naltogether. Were that to occur, the majority\u2019s fear of an\n\u201ceconomy-class\u201d version of the law will truly become a real-\nity. See ante, at 17. As Georgia explains, its contract ena-\nbles the OCGA to be sold at a fraction of the cost of compet-\ning annotated codes. For example, Georgia asserts that\nLexis sold the OCGA for $404 in 2016, while West Publish-\ning\u2019s competing annotated code sold for $2,570. Should\nstate annotated codes disappear, those without the means\nto pay the competitor\u2019s significantly higher price tag will\nhave a valuable research tool taken away from them.\nMeanwhile, this Court, which is privileged to have access to\nnumerous research resources, will scarcely notice. These\nnegative practical ramifications are unfortunate enough\nwhen they reflect the deliberative legislative choices that\nwe as judges are bound to respect. They are all the more\nregrettable when they are the result of our own meddling.\nFortunately, as the majority and I agree, \u201c \u2018critics of [to-\nday\u2019s] ruling can take their objections across the street,\n[where] Congress can correct any mistake it sees.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n13 (quoting Kimble v.

Nor are\nother materials created by state legislators in the course of\nperforming their lawmaking responsibilities, e.g., legisla-\ntive committee reports, floor statements, unenacted bills.\nAnte, at 8\u20139. Not all that legislators do, however, is ineligi-\nble for copyright protection; the government edicts doctrine\nshields only \u201cworks that are (1) created by judges and leg-\nislators (2) in the course of their judicial and legislative du-\nties.\u201d Ante, at 9 (emphasis added). The core question this\ncase presents, as I see it: Are the annotations in the Official\nCode of Georgia Annotated (OCGA) done in a legislative ca-\npacity? The answer, I am persuaded, should be no.\n   To explain why, I proceed from common ground. All\nagree that headnotes and syllabi for judicial opinions\u2014both\na kind of annotation\u2014are copyrightable when created by a\nreporter of decisions, Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617,\n645\u2013650 (1888), but are not copyrightable when created by\njudges, Banks v. Manchester, 128 U. S. 244, 253 (1888).\nThat is so because \u201c[t]he whole work done by . . . judges,\u201d\nibid., including dissenting and concurring opinions, ranks\nas work performed in their judicial capacity. Judges do not\noutsource their writings to \u201carm[s]\u201d or \u201cadjunct[s],\u201d cf. ante,\nat 9, 11, to be composed in their stead. Accordingly, the\n\f2           GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\njudicial opinion-drafting process in its entirety\u2014including\nthe drafting of headnotes and syllabi, in jurisdictions where\nthat is done by judges\u2014falls outside the reach of copyright\nprotection.\n  One might ask: If a judge\u2019s annotations are not copyright-\nable, why are those created by legislators? The answer lies\nin the difference between the role of a judge and the role of\na legislator. \u201c[T]o the judiciary\u201d we assign \u201cthe duty of in-\nterpreting and applying\u201d the law, Massachusetts v. Mellon,\n262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923), and sometimes making the appli-\ncable law, see Friendly, In Praise of Erie\u2014and of the New\nFederal Common Law, 39 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 383 (1964). See\nalso Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (\u201cIt is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-\nment to say what the law is.\u201d). In contrast, the role of the\nlegislature encompasses the process of \u201cmaking laws\u201d\u2014not\nconstruing statutes after their enactment. Mellon, 262\nU. S., at 488; see Patchak v. Zinke, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5) (\u201c[T]he legislative power is\nthe power to make law.\u201d). The OCGA annotations, in my\nappraisal, do not rank as part of the Georgia Legislature\u2019s\nlawmaking process for three reasons.\n  First, the annotations are not created contemporaneously\nwith the statutes to which they pertain; instead, the anno-\ntations comment on statutes already enacted. See, e.g.,\nApp. 268\u2013269 (text of enacted laws are transmitted to the\npublisher for the addition of commentary); id., at 403\u2013404\n(publisher adds new case notes on a rolling basis as courts\nconstrue existing statutes).1 In short, annotating begins\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For example, OCGA \u00a711\u20132A\u2013213 was enacted, in its current form, in\n\n1993. See 1993 Ga. Laws p. 633. The case notes contained in the OCGA\nsummarize judicial decisions construing the statute years later. See\n\u00a711\u20132A\u2013213 (2002) (citing Griffith v. Medical Rental Supply of Albany,\nGa., Inc., 244 Ga. App. 120, 534 S. E. 2d 859 (2000); Bailey v. Tucker\nEquip. Sales, Inc., 236 Ga. App. 289, 510 S. E. 2d 904 (1999)).\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nonly after lawmaking ends. This sets the OCGA annota-\ntions apart from uncopyrightable legislative materials like\ncommittee reports, generated before a law\u2019s enactment, and\ntied tightly to the task of law-formulation.\n   Second, the OCGA annotations are descriptive rather\nthan prescriptive. Instead of stating the legislature\u2019s per-\nception of what a law conveys, the annotations summarize\nwritings in which others express their views on a given stat-\nute. For example, the OCGA contains \u201ccase annotations\u201d\nfor \u201c[a]ll decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the\nCourt of Appeals of Georgia and all decisions of the federal\ncourts in cases which arose in Georgia construing any por-\ntion of the general statutory law of the state.\u201d Id., at 403.\nPer the Code Revision Commission\u2019s instructions, each an-\nnotation should \u201caccurately reflect the facts, holding, and\nstatutory construction\u201d adopted by the court. Id., at 404.\nThe annotations are neutrally cast; they do not opine on\nwhether the summarized case was correctly decided. See,\ne.g., OCGA \u00a717\u20137\u201350 (2013) (case annotation summarizing\nfacts and holdings of nine cases construing right to grand\njury hearing). This characteristic of the annotations distin-\nguishes them from preenactment legislative materials that\ntouch or concern the correct interpretation of the legisla-\nture\u2019s work.\n   Third, and of prime importance, the OCGA annotations\nare \u201cgiven for the purpose of convenient reference\u201d by the\npublic, \u00a71\u20131\u20137 (2019); they aim to inform the citizenry at\nlarge, they do not address, particularly, those seated in leg-\nislative chambers.2 Annotations are thus unlike, for exam-\nple, surveys, work commissioned by a legislature to aid in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Suppose a committee of Georgia\u2019s legislature, to inform the public,\n\ninstructs a staffer to write a guide titled \u201cThe Workways of the Georgia\nLegislature.\u201d The final text describing how the legislature operates is\ncirculated to members of the legislature and approved by a majority.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s decision, I take it that such a work, which entails\nno lawmaking, would be copyrightable.\n\f4            GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndetermining whether existing law should be amended.\n   The requirement that the statutory portions of the OCGA\n\u201cshall be merged with annotations,\u201d \u00a71\u20131\u20131, does not ren-\nder the annotations anything other than explanatory, ref-\nerential, or commentarial material. See Harrison Co. v.\nCode Revision Comm\u2019n, 244 Ga. 325, 331, 260 S. E. 2d 30,\n35 (1979) (observation by the Supreme Court of Georgia\nthat \u201cinclusion of annotations in [the] \u2018official Code\u2019 \u201d does\nnot \u201cgive the annotations any official weight\u201d).3 Annota-\ntions aid the legal researcher, and that aid is enhanced\nwhen annotations are printed beneath or alongside the rel-\nevant statutory text. But the placement of annotations in\nthe OCGA does not alter their auxiliary, nonlegislative\ncharacter.\n\n                       *     *     *\n   Because summarizing judicial decisions and commentary\nbearing on enacted statutes, in contrast to, for example,\ndrafting a committee report to accompany proposed legisla-\ntion, is not done in a legislator\u2019s law-shaping capacity, I\nwould hold the OCGA annotations copyrightable and there-\nfore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 That the Georgia Supreme Court described the Commission\u2019s work as\n\n\u201cwithin the sphere of legislative authority\u201d for state separation-of-powers\npurposes, Harrison Co. v.

Under the government edicts doctrine,\n  officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot be the au-\n  thors of the works they create in the course of their official duties.\n     The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the Official Code of Geor-\n  gia Annotated (OCGA). That Code includes the text of every Georgia\n  statute currently in force, as well as a set of non-binding annotations\n  that appear beneath each statutory provision. The annotations typi-\n  cally include summaries of judicial opinions construing each provision,\n  summaries of pertinent opinions of the state attorney general, and a\n  list of related law review articles and other reference materials. The\n  OCGA is assembled by the Code Revision Commission, a state entity\n  composed mostly of legislators, funded through legislative branch ap-\n  propriations, and staffed by the Office of Legislative Counsel.\n     The annotations in the current OCGA were produced by Matthew\n  Bender & Co., Inc., a division of the LexisNexis Group, pursuant to a\n  work-for-hire agreement with the Commission. Under the agreement,\n  Lexis drafts the annotations under the supervision of the Commission,\n  which specifies what the annotations must include in exacting detail.\n  The agreement also states that any copyright in the OCGA vests in the\n  State of Georgia, acting through the Commission.\n     Respondent Public.Resource.Org (PRO), a nonprofit dedicated to fa-\n  cilitating public access to government records and legal materials,\n  posted the OCGA online and distributed copies to various organiza-\n  tions and Georgia officials. After sending PRO several cease-and-de-\n  sist letters, the Commission sued PRO for infringing its copyright in\n  the OCGA annotations. PRO counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory\n  judgment that the entire OCGA, including the annotations, fell in the\n\f2             GEORGIA v.

The District Court sided with the Commission, holding\n    that the annotations were eligible for copyright protection because\n    they had not been enacted into law. The Eleventh Circuit reversed,\n    rejecting the Commission\u2019s copyright assertion under the government\n    edicts doctrine.\nHeld: The OCGA annotations are ineligible for copyright protection.\n Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The government edicts doctrine developed from a trio of 19th-\n century cases.

Because legislators, like judges, have\n the authority to make law, it follows that they, too, cannot be \u201cau-\n thors.\u201d And, as with judges, the doctrine applies to whatever work\n legislators perform in their capacity as legislators, including explana-\n tory and procedural materials they create in the discharge of their leg-\n islative duties. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) Applying that framework, Georgia\u2019s annotations are not copy-\n rightable. First, the author of the annotations qualifies as a legislator.\n Under the Copyright Act, the sole \u201cauthor\u201d of the annotations is the\n Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7201(b), which functions as an arm of the\n Georgia Legislature in producing the annotations. Second, the Com-\n mission creates the annotations in the discharge of its legislative du-\n ties. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (c) Georgia argues that excluding the OCGA annotations from copy-\n right protection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. First, it\n notes that \u00a7101 lists \u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible\n for copyright protection. That provision, however, refers only to \u201can-\n notations . . . which . . . represent an original work of authorship.\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (Emphasis added.) Georgia\u2019s annotations do not fit that description\n  because they are prepared by a legislative body that cannot be deemed\n  the \u201cauthor\u201d of the works it creates in its official capacity. Second,\n  Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact that the Act excludes\n  from copyright protection works prepared by Federal Government of-\n  ficials, without establishing a similar rule for State officials. \u00a7\u00a7101,\n  105. That rule, however, applies to all federal officials, regardless of\n  the nature and scope of their duties. It does not suggest an intent to\n  displace the much narrower government edits doctrine with respect to\n  the States.\n     Moving on from the text, Georgia invokes what it views as the offi-\n  cial position of the Copyright Office, as reflected in the Compendium\n  of U. S. Copyright Office Practices. The Compendium, however, is a\n  non-binding administrative manual and is largely consistent with this\n  Court\u2019s position. Georgia also appeals to copyright policy, but such\n  requests should be addressed to Congress, not the courts.\n     Georgia attempts to frame the government edicts doctrine to focus\n  exclusively on whether a particular work has the force of law. But that\n  understanding cannot be squared with precedent\u2014especially Banks.\n  Moreover, Georgia\u2019s conception of the doctrine as distinguishing be-\n  tween different categories of content with different effects has less of\n  a textual footing than the traditional formulation, which focuses on the\n  identity of the author. Georgia\u2019s characterization of the OCGA anno-\n  tations as non-binding and non-authoritative undersells the practical\n  significance of the annotations to litigants and citizens. And its ap-\n  proach would logically permit States to hide all non-binding judicial\n  and legislative work product\u2014including dissents and legislative his-\n  tory\u2014behind a paywall.

The question in this case is whether that protec-\ntion extends to the annotations contained in Georgia\u2019s\nofficial annotated code.\n   We hold that it does not. Over a century ago, we recog-\nnized a limitation on copyright protection for certain\ngovernment work product, rooted in the Copyright Act\u2019s\n\u201cauthorship\u201d requirement. Under what has been dubbed\nthe government edicts doctrine, officials empowered to\nspeak with the force of law cannot be the authors of\u2014and\ntherefore cannot copyright\u2014the works they create in the\ncourse of their official duties.\n   We have previously applied that doctrine to hold that\nnon-binding, explanatory legal materials are not copyright-\nable when created by judges who possess the authority to\nmake and interpret the law. See Banks v. Manchester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92329\"><a href=\"/opinion/92329/banks-v-manchester/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1888).

PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na legislative body vested with the authority to make law.\nBecause Georgia\u2019s annotations are authored by an arm\nof the legislature in the course of its legislative duties, the\ngovernment edicts doctrine puts them outside the reach of\ncopyright protection.\n                              I\n                              A\n   The State of Georgia has one official code\u2014the \u201cOfficial\nCode of Georgia Annotated,\u201d or OCGA. The first page of\neach volume of the OCGA boasts the State\u2019s official seal and\nannounces to readers that it is \u201cPublished Under Authority\nof the State.\u201d\n   The OCGA includes the text of every Georgia statute\ncurrently in force, as well as various non-binding supple-\nmentary materials. At issue in this case is a set of annota-\ntions that appear beneath each statutory provision. The\nannotations generally include summaries of judicial deci-\nsions applying a given provision, summaries of any perti-\nnent opinions of the state attorney general, and a list of re-\nlated law review articles and similar reference materials.\nIn addition, the annotations often include editor\u2019s notes\nthat provide information about the origins of the statutory\ntext, such as whether it derives from a particular judicial\ndecision or resembles an older provision that has been con-\nstrued by Georgia courts. See, e.g., OCGA \u00a7\u00a751\u20131\u20131, 53\u20134\u2013\n2 (2019).\n   The OCGA is assembled by a state entity called the Code\nRevision Commission. In 1977, the Georgia Legislature\nestablished the Commission to recodify Georgia law for the\nfirst time in decades. The Commission was (and remains)\ntasked with consolidating disparate bills into a single Code\nfor reenactment by the legislature and contracting with a\nthird party to produce the annotations. A majority of the\nCommission\u2019s 15 members must be members of the Georgia\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

At the\noutset, Georgia advances two arguments for why, in its\nview, excluding the OCGA annotations from copyright\nprotection conflicts with the text of the Copyright Act. Both\nare unavailing.\n   First, Georgia notes that \u00a7101 of the Act specifically lists\n\u201cannotations\u201d among the kinds of works eligible for copy-\nright protection. But that provision refers only to \u201cannota-\ntions . . . which . . . represent an original work of author-\nship.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7101 (emphasis added). The whole point\nof the government edicts doctrine is that judges and legis-\nlators cannot serve as authors when they produce works in\ntheir official capacity. While the reference to \u201cannotations\u201d\n\f12        GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin \u00a7101 may help explain why supplemental, explanatory\nmaterials are copyrightable when prepared by a private\nparty, or a non-lawmaking official like the reporter in Cal-\nlaghan, it does not speak to whether those same materials\nare copyrightable when prepared by a judge or a legislator.\nIn the same way that judicial materials are ineligible for\nprotection even though they plainly qualify as \u201c[l]iterary\nworks . . . expressed in words,\u201d ibid., legislative materials\nare ineligible for protection even if they happen to fit the\ndescription of otherwise copyrightable \u201cannotations.\u201d\n  Second, Georgia draws a negative inference from the fact\nthat the Act excludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s]\nprepared by an officer or employee of the United States\nGovernment as part of that person\u2019s official duties\u201d and\ndoes not establish a similar rule for the States. \u00a7101; see\nalso \u00a7105. But the bar on copyright protection for federal\nworks sweeps much more broadly than the government\nedicts doctrine does. That bar applies to works created by\nall federal \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s],\u201d without regard for the\nnature of their position or scope of their authority. What-\never policy reasons might justify the Federal Government\u2019s\ndecision to forfeit copyright protection for its own proprie-\ntary works, that federal rule does not suggest an intent to\ndisplace the much narrower government edicts doctrine\nwith respect to the States. That doctrine does not apply to\nnon-lawmaking officials, leaving States free to assert copy-\nright in the vast majority of expressive works they produce,\nsuch as those created by their universities, libraries,\ntourism offices, and so on.\n  More generally, Georgia suggests that we should resist\napplying our government edicts precedents to the OCGA\nannotations because our 19th-century forebears inter-\npreted the statutory term author by reference to \u201cpublic\npolicy\u201d\u2014an approach that Georgia believes is incongruous\nwith the \u201cmodern era\u201d of statutory interpretation.

Under\nthe logic of Georgia\u2019s \u201cforce of law\u201d test, States would own\nsuch materials and could charge the public for access to\nthem.\n  Furthermore, despite Georgia\u2019s and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s\npurported concern for the text of the Copyright Act, their\nconception of the government edicts doctrine has less of a\ntextual footing than the traditional formulation. The tex-\ntual basis for the doctrine is the Act\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d require-\nment, which unsurprisingly focuses on\u2014the author.\nJUSTICE THOMAS urges us to dig deeper to \u201cthe root\u201d of our\ngovernment edicts precedents. Post, at 5. But, in our view,\nthe text is the root. The Court long ago interpreted the\nword \u201cauthor\u201d to exclude officials empowered to speak with\nthe force of law, and Congress has carried that meaning for-\nward in multiple iterations of the Copyright Act. This tex-\ntual foundation explains why the doctrine distinguishes be-\ntween some authors (who are empowered to speak with the\nforce of law) and others (who are not).

But the contours of the rule were\nfar from clear, and to understand the scope of the doctrine,\nwe must explore its underlying rationale.\n   In my view, the majority\u2019s uncritical extrapolation of\nprecedent is inconsistent with the judicial role. An unwill-\ningness to examine the root of a precedent has led to the\nsprouting of many noxious weeds that distort the meaning\nof the Constitution and statutes alike. Although we have\nnot been asked to revisit these precedents, it behooves us to\nexplore the origin of and justification for them, especially\nwhen we are asked to apply their rule for the first time in\nover 130 years.\n   The Court\u2019s precedents suggest three possible grounds\nsupporting their conclusion. In Banks, the Court referred\nto the meaning of the term \u201cauthor\u201d in copyright law. While\nthe Court did not develop this argument, it is conceivable\nthat the contemporaneous public meaning of the term \u201cau-\nthor\u201d was narrower in the copyright context than in ordi-\nnary speech. At the time this Court decided Banks, the\nCopyright Act provided protection for books, maps, prints,\nengravings, musical and dramatic compositions, photo-\ngraphs, and works of art.1 Judicial opinions differ markedly\nfrom these works. Books, for instance, express the thoughts\nof their authors. They typically have no power beyond the\nability of their words to influence readers, and they usually\nare published at private expense.

First, unlike judicial opinions and statutes,\nthese annotations do not even purport to embody the will of\nthe people because they are not law. The General Assembly\nof Georgia has made abundantly clear through a variety of\nprovisions that the annotations do not create any binding\nobligations. OCGA \u00a71\u20131\u20137 states that \u201c[a]ll historical cita-\ntions, title and chapter analyses, and notes set out in this\nCode are given for the purpose of convenient reference and\ndo not constitute part of the law.\u201d Section 1\u20131\u20131 further\nprovides that \u201c[t]he statutory portion of the codification of\nGeorgia laws . . . is enacted and shall have the effect of stat-\nutes enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia. The stat-\nutory portion of such codification shall be merged with an-\nnotations . . . and other materials . . . and shall be published\nby authority of the state.\u201d Thus, although the materials\n\f8         GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cmerge\u201d prior to publication in the \u201cofficial\u201d code, the very\nprovision calling for that merger makes clear that the an-\nnotations serve as commentary, not law.\n   As additional evidence that the annotations do not repre-\nsent the will of the people, the General Assembly does not\nenact statutory annotations under its legislative power.\nSee Ga. Const., Art. III, \u00a71, \u00b61 (vesting the legislative power\nin the General Assembly). To enact state law, Georgia em-\nploys a process of bicameralism and presentment similar to\nthat embodied in the United States Constitution. See Ga.\nConst., Art. III, \u00a75; Art. V, \u00a72, \u00b64. The annotations do not\ngo through this process, a fact that even the majority must\nacknowledge. Ante, at 10; Ga. S. 52, Reg. Sess., \u00a754(b)\n(2019\u20132020) (\u201cAnnotations . . . except as otherwise provided\nin the Code . . . are not enacted as statutes by the provisions\nof this Act\u201d).\n   Second, unlike judges and legislators, the creators of an-\nnotations are incentivized by the copyright laws to produce\na desirable product that will eventually earn them a profit.\nAnd though the Commission may require Lexis to follow\nstrict guidelines, the independent synthesis, analysis, and\ncreative drafting behind the annotations makes them anal-\nogous to other copyrightable materials. See Brief for Mat-\nthew Bender & Co., Inc., as Amicus Curiae 4\u20137.\n   Lastly, the annotations do not impede fair notice of the\nlaws. As just stated, the annotations do not carry the bind-\ning force of law. They simply summarize independent\nsources of legal information and consolidate them in one\nplace. Thus, OCGA annotations serve a similar function to\nother copyrighted research tools provided by private parties\nsuch as the American Law Reports and Westlaw, which also\ncontain information of great \u201cpractical significance.\u201d Ante,\nat 17.

As an initial matter, the Act does not define\nthe word \u201cauthor,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7101, or make any reference\nto the government edicts doctrine. Accordingly, the term\n\u201cauthor\u201d itself does not shed any light on whether the doc-\ntrine covers statutory annotations. Second, while the Act\nexcludes from copyright protection \u201cwork[s] prepared by an\nofficer or employee of the United States Government as part\nof that person\u2019s official duties,\u201d \u00a7101; see also \u00a7105, the Act\ncontains no similar prohibition against works of state gov-\nernments or works prepared at their behest. \u201cCongress\u2019 use\nof explicit language in one provision cautions against infer-\nring the same limitation\u201d elsewhere in the statute.

Third, the Act specifi-\ncally notes that annotations are copyrightable derivative\nworks. \u00a7101. Here, again, the Act does not expressly ex-\nclude from copyright protection annotations created either\nby the State or at the State\u2019s request. Fourth, the Act pro-\nvides that an author may hold a copyright in \u201cmaterial con-\ntributed\u201d in a derivative work, \u201cas distinguished from the\npreexisting material employed in the work.\u201d \u00a7103(b); see\nalso Feist Publications, Inc. v.

These aspects of the statutory\ntext, taken together, further support the conclusion that the\nOCGA annotations are copyrightable.\n   For all these reasons, I would conclude that, as with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the majority explains, ante, at 9, the annotations were created as\n\npart of a work-for-hire agreement between the Commission and Lexis.\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7201(b).

In\nits view, the Court in Banks held that judges are not \u201cau-\nthors\u201d within the scope of the Copyright Act for \u201cwhatever\nwork they perform in their capacity as </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">judges,\u201d</span> <span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at\n<span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, so the same must be true for legislators, see ante, at 8\u2013\n9. Accordingly, works created by legislators in their legis-\nlative capacity are not \u201coriginal works of authorship,\u201d \u00a7102,\nand therefore cannot be copyrighted. This argument is\nflawed in multiple respects.\n                               A\n   Most notably, the majority\u2019s textual analysis hinges on\naccepting that its construction of \u201cauthorship,\u201d i.e., all\nworks produced in a judge\u2019s or legislator\u2019s official capacity,\nwas so well established by our 19th-century precedents that\nCongress incorporated it into the multiple revisions of the\nCopyright Act. See ante, at 12\u201313. Such confidence is ques-\ntionable, to say the least.\n   The majority\u2019s understanding of the government edicts\ndoctrine seems to have been lost on dozens of States and\nTerritories, as well as the lower courts in this case. As al-\nready stated, the 25 jurisdictions with official annotated\ncodes apparently did not view this Court\u2019s precedents as es-\ntablishing the \u201cofficial duties\u201d definition of authorship. See\nBrief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae.4 And if\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 According to one study published in 2000, approximately half of\n\nStates owned copyright in official state statutory compilations, court re-\nports, or administrative regulations. Dmitrieva, State Ownership of\nCopyrights in Primary Law Materials, 23 Hastings Com. & Entertain-\nment L. J. 81, 83, 97\u2013105 (2000).

Rather than following\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cstraightforward\u201d path, ante, at 5, the Elev-\nenth Circuit looked to the \u201czone of indeterminacy at the\nfrontier between edicts that carry the force of law and\nthose that do not\u201d to determine whether the annotations\nwere \u201csufficiently law-like\u201d to be \u201cconstructively authored\nby the People.\u201d Code Revision Comm\u2019n v.

See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a72\u20134\u2013203(1)(c) (2019); Iowa Code \u00a74.6(3)\n(2019); Minn. Stat. \u00a7645.16(7) (2018); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a712\u20132A\u201320(C)(2)\n(2019); N. D.

Given the\ndirect role that legislative history plays in the construction of statutes in\nthese States, it is hardly clear that such States could subject their legis-\nlative histories to copyright.\n\f16          GEORGIA v. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmatter, the majority\u2019s rule will prove difficult to administer.\nAccording to one group of amici, nearly all jurisdictions\nwith annotated codes use private contractors that \u201calmost\ninvariably prepare [annotations] under the supervision of\nlegislative-branch or judicial-branch officials, including\nstate legislators or state-court judges.\u201d Brief for State of\nArkansas et al. as Amici Curiae 16\u201317. Under the major-\nity\u2019s view, any one of these commissions or counsels could\npotentially be reclassified as an \u201cadjunct to the legislature.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. But the majority\u2019s test for ascertaining the true\nnature of these commissions raises far more questions than\nit answers.\n   The majority lists a number of factors\u2014including the\nCommission\u2019s membership and funding, how the annota-\ntions become part of the OCGA, and descriptions of the\nCommission from court cases\u2014to support its conclusion\nthat the Commission is really part of the legislature. See\nante, at 9\u201310. But it does not specify whether these factors\nare exhaustive or illustrative and, if the latter, what other\nfactors may be important. The majority also does not spec-\nify whether some factors weigh more heavily than others\nwhen deciding whether to deem an oversight body a legis-\nlative adjunct.\n   And even when the majority does list concrete factors,\npivotal guidance remains lacking. For example, the major-\nity finds it meaningful that 9 out of the Commission\u2019s 15\nmembers are legislators. Ante, at 9; see OCGA \u00a728\u20139\u20132\n(noting that the other members of the Commission include\nthe State\u2019s Lieutenant Governor, a judge, a district attor-\nney, and three other state bar members). But how many\nlegislative members are needed for a commission to become\na legislative adjunct? The majority provides no answers to\nany of these questions.\n                         *     *    *\n     The majority\u2019s rule will leave in the lurch the many\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

Perhaps, to the detriment\nof all, many States will stop producing annotated codes\naltogether. Were that to occur, the majority\u2019s fear of an\n\u201ceconomy-class\u201d version of the law will truly become a real-\nity. See ante, at 17. As Georgia explains, its contract ena-\nbles the OCGA to be sold at a fraction of the cost of compet-\ning annotated codes. For example, Georgia asserts that\nLexis sold the OCGA for $404 in 2016, while West Publish-\ning\u2019s competing annotated code sold for $2,570. Should\nstate annotated codes disappear, those without the means\nto pay the competitor\u2019s significantly higher price tag will\nhave a valuable research tool taken away from them.\nMeanwhile, this Court, which is privileged to have access to\nnumerous research resources, will scarcely notice. These\nnegative practical ramifications are unfortunate enough\nwhen they reflect the deliberative legislative choices that\nwe as judges are bound to respect. They are all the more\nregrettable when they are the result of our own meddling.\nFortunately, as the majority and I agree, \u201c \u2018critics of [to-\nday\u2019s] ruling can take their objections across the street,\n[where] Congress can correct any mistake it sees.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n13 (quoting Kimble v.

The OCGA annotations, in my\nappraisal, do not rank as part of the Georgia Legislature\u2019s\nlawmaking process for three reasons.\n  First, the annotations are not created contemporaneously\nwith the statutes to which they pertain; instead, the anno-\ntations comment on statutes already enacted.

UNITED\n                  STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 18\u20131023. Argued December 10, 2019\u2014Decided April 27, 2020*\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established online ex-\n  changes where insurers could sell their healthcare plans. The now-\n  expired \u201cRisk Corridors\u201d program aimed to limit the plans\u2019 profits and\n  losses during the exchanges\u2019 first three years (2014 through 2016). See\n  \u00a71342, 124 Stat. 211. Section 1342 set out a formula for computing a\n  plan\u2019s gains or losses at the end of each year, providing that eligible\n  profitable plans \u201cshall pay\u201d the Secretary of the Department of Health\n  and Human Services (HHS), while the Secretary \u201cshall pay\u201d eligible\n  unprofitable plans. The Act neither appropriated funds for these\n  yearly payments nor limited the amounts that the Government might\n  pay. Nor was the program required to be budget neutral. Each year,\n  the Government owed more money to unprofitable insurers than prof-\n  itable insurers owed to the Government, resulting in a total deficit of\n  more than $12 billion. And at the end of each year, the appropriations\n  bills for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in-\n  cluded a rider preventing CMS from using the funds for Risk Corridors\n  payments. Petitioners\u2014four health-insurance companies that claim\n  losses under the program\u2014sued the Federal Government for damages\n  in the Court of Federal Claims. Invoking the Tucker Act, they alleged\n  that \u00a71342 obligated the Government to pay the full amount of their\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 18\u20131028, Moda Health Plan, Inc. v.

United States (see this Court\u2019s Rule 12.4); and No. 18\u20131038, Land\nof Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Co. v. United States, also on certio-\nrari to the same court.\n\f2 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v.

Only one petitioner prevailed in the\n trial courts, and the Federal Circuit ruled for the Government in each\n appeal, holding that \u00a71342 had initially created a Government obliga-\n tion to pay the full amounts, but that the subsequent appropriations\n riders impliedly \u201crepealed or suspended\u201d that obligation.\nHeld:\n    1. The Risk Corridors statute created a Government obligation to\n pay insurers the full amount set out in \u00a71342\u2019s formula. Pp. 9\u201316.\n       (a) The Government may incur an obligation directly through\n statutory language, without also providing details about how the obli-\n gation must be satisfied. See United States v. Langston, 118 U. S. 389.\n Pp. 9\u201311.\n       (b) Section 1342 imposed a legal duty of the United States that\n could mature into a legal liability through the insurers\u2019 participation\n in the exchanges. This conclusion flows from the express terms and\n context of \u00a71342, which imposed an obligation by using the mandatory\n term \u201cshall.\u201d The section\u2019s mandatory nature is underscored by the\n adjacent provisions, which differentiate between when the HHS Sec-\n retary \u201cshall\u201d take certain actions and when she \u201cmay\u201d exercise discre-\n tion. See \u00a7\u00a71341(b)(2), 1343(b). Section 1342 neither requires the Risk\n Corridors program to be budget-neutral nor suggests that the Secre-\n tary\u2019s payments to unprofitable plans pivoted on profitable plans\u2019 pay-\n ments to the Secretary or that a partial payment would satisfy the\n Government\u2019s whole obligation. It thus must be given its plain mean-\n ing: The Government \u201cshall pay\u201d the sum prescribed by \u00a71342. Pp. 11\u2013\n 13.\n       (c) Contrary to the Government\u2019s contention, neither the Appro-\n priations Clause nor the Anti-Deficiency Act addresses whether Con-\n gress itself can create or incur an obligation directly by statute. Nor\n does \u00a71342\u2019s obligation-creating language turn on whether Congress\n expressly provided budget authority before appropriating funds. The\n Government\u2019s arguments also conflict with well-settled principles of\n statutory interpretation. That \u00a71342 contains no language limiting\n the obligation to the availability of appropriations, while Congress ex-\n pressly used such limiting language in other Affordable Care Act pro-\n visions, indicates that Congress intended a different meaning in\n \u00a71342. Pp. 13\u201316.\n    2. Congress did not impliedly repeal the obligation through its ap-\n propriations riders. Pp. 16\u201323.\n       (a) Because \u201c \u2018repeals by implication are not favored,\u2019 \u201d Morton v.\n Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 549, this Court will regard each of two statutes\n effective unless Congress\u2019 intention to repeal is \u201c \u2018clear and manifest,\u2019 \u201d\n or the laws are \u201cirreconcilable,\u201d id., at 550\u2013551.

S. 509, 515. As Langston and Vulte confirm, the appro-\npriations riders here did not manifestly repeal or discharge the Gov-\nernment\u2019s uncapped obligation, see Langston, 118 U. S., at 394, and do\nnot indicate \u201cany other purpose than the disbursement of a sum of\nmoney for the particular fiscal years,\u201d Vulte, 233 U. S., at 514. Nor is\nthere any indication that HHS and CMS thought that the riders\nclearly expressed an intent to repeal. Pp. 16\u201319.\n       (b) Appropriations measures have been found irreconcilable with\nstatutory obligations to pay, but the riders here did not use the kind of\n\u201cshall not take effect\u201d language decisive in United States v. Will, 449\nU. S. 200, 222\u2013223, or purport to \u201csuspen[d]\u201d \u00a71342 prospectively or to\nforeclose funds from \u201cany other Act\u201d \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d \u00a71342\u2019s money-\nmandating text, United States v. Dickerson, 310 U. S. 554, 556\u2013557.\nThey also did not reference \u00a71342\u2019s payment formula, let alone \u201cirrec-\noncilabl[y]\u201d change it, United States v. Mitchell, 109 U. S. 146, 150, or\nprovide that payments from profitable plans would be \u201c \u2018in full compen-\nsation\u2019 \u201d of the Government\u2019s obligation to unprofitable plans, United\nStates v. Fisher, 109 U. S. 143, 150. Pp. 19\u201321.\n       (c) The legislative history cited by the Federal Circuit is also un-\npersuasive. Pp. 22\u201323.\n    3. Petitioners properly relied on the Tucker Act to sue for damages\nin the Court of Federal Claims. Pp. 23\u201330.\n       (a) The United States has waived its immunity for certain dam-\nages suits in the Court of Federal Claims through the Tucker Act. Be-\ncause that Act does not create \u201csubstantive rights,\u201d United States v.\nNavajo Nation, 556 U. S. 287, 290, a plaintiff must premise her dam-\nages action on \u201cother sources of law,\u201d like \u201cstatutes or contracts,\u201d ibid.,\nprovided those statutes \u201c \u2018can fairly be interpreted as mandating com-\npensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained,\u2019 \u201d\nUnited States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 472. The\nAct does, however, yield when the obligation-creating statute provides\nits own detailed remedies or when the Administrative Procedure Act\nprovides an avenue for relief. Pp. 23\u201326.\n       (b) Petitioners clear each hurdle: The Risk Corridors statute is\nfairly interpreted as mandating compensation for damages, and nei-\nther exception to the Tucker Act applies. Section 1342\u2019s mandatory\n\u201c \u2018shall pay\u2019 language\u201d falls comfortably within the class of statutes\nthat permit recovery of money damages in the Court of Federal Claims.\nThis finding is bolstered by \u00a71342\u2019s focus on compensating insurers for\npast conduct. And there is no separate remedial scheme supplanting\nthe Court of Federal Claims\u2019 power to adjudicate petitioners\u2019 claims.\n\f4 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v.

In contrast to\n  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.

The Risk\n  Corridors statute and Tucker Act allow them that remedy.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nafford it. The Affordable Care Act did this by, among other\nthings, providing tax credits to help people buy insurance\nand establishing online marketplaces where insurers could\nsell plans. To encourage insurers to enter those market-\nplaces, the Act created several programs to defray the car-\nriers\u2019 costs and cabin their risks.\n   Among these initiatives was the \u201cRisk Corridors\u201d pro-\ngram, a temporary framework meant to compensate insur-\ners for unexpectedly unprofitable plans during the market-\nplaces\u2019 first three years. The since-expired Risk Corridors\nstatute, \u00a71342, set a formula for calculating payments un-\nder the program: If an insurance plan loses a certain\namount of money, the Federal Government \u201cshall pay\u201d the\nplan; if the plan makes a certain amount of money, the plan\n\u201cshall pay\u201d the Government. See \u00a71342, 124 Stat. 211\u2013212\n(codified at 42 U. S. C. \u00a718062). Some plans made money\nand paid the Government. Many suffered losses and sought\nreimbursement. The Government, however, did not pay.\n   These cases are about whether petitioners\u2014insurers who\nclaim losses under the Risk Corridors program\u2014have a\nright to payment under \u00a71342 and a damages remedy for\nthe unpaid amounts. We hold that they do. We conclude\nthat \u00a71342 of the Affordable Care Act established a money-\nmandating obligation, that Congress did not repeal this ob-\nligation, and that petitioners may sue the Government for\ndamages in the Court of Federal Claims.\n                             I\n                             A\n   In 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Af-\nfordable Care Act, 124 Stat. 119, seeking to improve na-\ntional health-insurance markets and extend coverage to\nmillions of people without adequate (or any) health insur-\nance. To that end, the Affordable Care Act called for the\ncreation of virtual health-insurance markets, or \u201cHealth\nBenefit Exchanges,\u201d in each State. 42 U. S.

In other words, the Act \u201cen-\nsure[s] that anyone can buy insurance.\u201d King v. Burwell,\n576 U. S. 473, 493 (2015).\n  Insurance carriers had many reasons to participate in\nthese new exchanges. Through the Affordable Care Act,\nthey gained access to millions of new customers with tax\ncredits worth \u201cbillions of dollars in spending each year.\u201d Id.,\nat 485. But the exchanges posed some business risks, too\u2014\nincluding a lack of \u201creliable data to estimate the cost of\nproviding care for the expanded pool of individuals seeking\ncoverage.\u201d 892 F. 3d 1311, 1314 (CA Fed. 2018) (case below\nin No. 18\u20131028).\n  This uncertainty could have given carriers pause and af-\nfected the rates they set. So the Affordable Care Act created\nseveral risk-mitigation programs. At issue here is the Risk\nCorridors program.1\n                               B\n  The Risk Corridors program aimed to limit participating\nplans\u2019 profits and losses for the exchanges\u2019 first three years\n(2014, 2015, and 2016). See \u00a71342, 124 Stat. 211, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a718062. It did so through a formula that computed\na plan\u2019s gains or losses at the end of each year. Plans with\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The others were the \u201cReinsurance\u201d and \u201cRisk Adjustment\u201d programs.\n\nThe former ran from 2014 to 2016 and required insurers to pay premi-\nums into a pool that compensated carriers covering \u201chigh risk individu-\nals.\u201d \u00a71341, 124 Stat. 208, 42 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprofits above a certain threshold would pay the Govern-\nment, while plans with losses below that threshold would\nreceive payments from the Government. \u00a71342(b), 124\nStat. 211. Specifically, \u00a71342 stated that the eligible prof-\nitable plans \u201cshall pay\u201d the Secretary of the Department of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS), while the Secretary\n\u201cshall pay\u201d the eligible unprofitable plans. Ibid.2\n   When it enacted the Affordable Care Act in 2010, Con-\ngress did not simultaneously appropriate funds for the\nyearly payments the Secretary could potentially owe under\nthe Risk Corridors program. Neither did Congress limit the\namounts that the Government might pay under \u00a71342. Nor\ndid the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u201cscore\u201d\u2014that\nis, calculate the budgetary impact of\u2014the Risk Corridors\nprogram.\n   In later years, the CBO noted that the Risk Corridors\nstatute did not require the program to be budget neutral.\nThe CBO reported that, \u201c[i]n contrast\u201d to the Act\u2019s other\nrisk-mitigation programs, \u201crisk corridor collections (which\nwill be recorded as revenues) will not necessarily equal risk\ncorridor payments, so that program can have net effects on\nthe budget deficit.\u201d CBO, The Budget and Economic Out-\nlook: 2014 to 2024, p. 59 (2014). The CBO thus recognized\nthat \u201c[i]f insurers\u2019 costs exceed their expectations, on aver-\nage, the risk corridor program will impose costs on the fed-\neral budget.\u201d Id., at 110.\n   Like the CBO, the federal agencies charged with imple-\nmenting the program agreed that \u00a71342 did not require\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 If a health insurance plan made (or lost) up to 3 percentage points\n\nmore than expected in a plan year, the plan would keep the gains (or\nlosses). If the plan made (or lost) between 3 and 8 percentage points\nmore than predicted, it would give up half of the earnings (or would be\ncompensated for half of the shortfalls) exceeding the 3 percentage-point\nthreshold. If the gains (or losses) exceeded predictions by eight percent-\nage points, the insurers would pay (or receive) 80 percent of the gains (or\nlosses) exceeding the 8 percentage-point mark.

Nine months before the program\nstarted, HHS acknowledged that the Risk Corridors pro-\ngram was \u201cnot statutorily required to be budget neutral.\u201d\n78 Fed. Reg. 15473 (2013). HHS assured, however, that\n\u201c[r]egardless of the balance of payments and receipts, HHS\nwill remit payments as required under Section 1342 of the\nAffordable Care Act.\u201d Ibid.\n   Similar guidance came from the Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency tasked with help-\ning the HHS Secretary collect and remit program pay-\nments. CMS confirmed that a lack of payments from prof-\nitable plans would not relieve the Government from making\nits payments to the unprofitable ones. See 79 Fed. Reg.\n30260 (2014). Citing \u201cconcerns that risk corridors collec-\ntions may not be sufficient to fully fund risk corridors pay-\nments\u201d to the unprofitable plans, CMS declared that \u201c[i]n\nthe unlikely event of a shortfall . . .

The agency again \u201crecognize[d] that the Affordable\nCare Act requires the Secretary to make full payments to\nissuers.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIn the unlikely event that risk corridors\ncollections\u201d were \u201cinsufficient to make risk corridors pay-\nments,\u201d HHS reassured, the Government would \u201cuse other\nsources of funding for the risk corridors payments, subject\nto the availability of appropriations.\u201d Ibid.\n   The 2015 program year also ran a deficit, this time worth\nabout $5.5 billion. See CMS, Risk Corridors Payment and\nCharge Amounts for the 2015 Benefit Year (2016). Facing\na second shortfall, CMS continued to \u201crecogniz[e] that the\nAffordable Care Act requires the Secretary to make full\npayments to issuers.\u201d CMS, Risk Corridors Payments for\n2015, p. 1 (2016). CMS also confirmed that \u201cHHS w[ould]\nrecord risk corridors payments due as an obligation of the\nUnited States Government for which full payment is re-\nquired.\u201d Ibid.

Petitioners in these consolidated\ncases are four health-insurance companies that partici-\npated in the healthcare exchanges: Maine Community\nHealth Options, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Caro-\nlina, Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Company,\nand Moda Health Plan, Inc. They assert that their plans\nwere unprofitable during the Risk Corridors program\u2019s 3-\nyear term and that, under \u00a71342, the HHS Secretary still\nowes them hundreds of millions of dollars.\n   These insurers sued the Federal Government for dam-\nages in the United States Court of Federal Claims, invoking\nthe Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71491. They alleged that \u00a71342\nof the Affordable Care Act obligated the Government to pay\nthe full amount of their losses as calculated by the statutory\nformula and sought a money judgment for the unpaid sums\nowed\u2014a claim that, if successful, could be satisfied through\nthe Judgment Fund.3 These lawsuits saw mixed results in\nthe trial courts.

UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit ruled for the Government in each ap-\npeal. See 892 F. 3d 1311; 892 F. 3d 1184 (2018); 729 Fed.\nAppx. 939 (2018). As relevant here, the Federal Circuit con-\ncluded that \u00a71342 had initially created a Government obli-\ngation to pay the full amounts that petitioners sought un-\nder the statutory formula. See 892 F. 3d, at 1320\u20131322.\nThe court also recognized that \u201cit has long been the law that\nthe government may incur a debt independent of an appro-\npriation to satisfy that debt, at least in certain circum-\nstances.\u201d Id., at 1321.\n   Even so, the court held that Congress\u2019 appropriations rid-\ners impliedly \u201crepealed or suspended\u201d the Government\u2019s ob-\nligation. Id., at 1322. Although the panel acknowledged\nthat \u201c[r]epeals by implication are generally disfavored\u201d\u2014\nespecially when the \u201calleged repeal occurred in an appro-\npriations bill\u201d\u2014it found that the riders here \u201cadequately ex-\npressed Congress\u2019s intent to suspend\u201d the Government\u2019s\npayments to unprofitable plans \u201cbeyond the sum of pay-\nments\u201d it collected from profitable plans. Id., at 1322\u20131323,\n1325.\n   Judge Newman dissented, observing that the Govern-\nment had not identified any \u201cstatement of abrogation or\namendment of the statute,\u201d nor any \u201cdisclaimer\u201d of the Gov-\nernment\u2019s \u201cstatutory and contractual commitments.\u201d Id.,\nat 1335. The dissent also reasoned that precedent under-\nmined the court\u2019s conclusion and that the appropriations\nriders could not apply retroactively because the Govern-\nment had used the Risk Corridors program to induce insur-\ners to enter the exchanges. Id., at 1336\u20131339. Emphasizing\nthe importance of Government credibility in public-private\nenterprise, the dissent warned that the majority\u2019s decision\nwould \u201cundermin[e] the reliability of dealings with the\ngovernment.\u201d Id., at 1340.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCl. 1 (2017) (dismissing Maine Community Health\u2019s statutory claims).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

The Govern-\nment may incur an obligation by contract or by statute. See\nibid.\n  Incurring an obligation, of course, is different from pay-\ning one. After all, the Constitution\u2019s Appropriations Clause\nprovides that \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury,\nbut in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a79, cl. 7; see also GAO, Principles of Federal Appro-\npriations Law 2\u20133 (4th ed. 2016) (hereinafter GAO\nRedbook) (\u201c[T]he authority to incur obligations by itself is\nnot sufficient to authorize payments from the Treasury\u201d).\n\f10 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nCreating and satisfying a Government obligation, there-\nfore, typically involves four steps: (1) Congress passes an\norganic statute (like the Affordable Care Act) that creates a\nprogram, agency, or function; (2) Congress passes an Act\nauthorizing appropriations; (3) Congress enacts the appro-\npriation, granting \u201cbudget authority\u201d to incur obligations\nand make payments, and designating the funds to be\ndrawn; and (4) the relevant Government entity begins in-\ncurring the obligation. See id., at 2\u201356; see also Op. Comp.\nGen., B\u2013193573 (Dec. 19, 1979).\n   But Congress can deviate from this pattern. It may, for\ninstance, authorize agencies to enter into contracts and\n\u201cincur obligations in advance of appropriations.\u201d GAO\nRedbook 2\u20134. In that context, the contracts \u201cconstitute ob-\nligations binding on the United States,\u201d such that a \u201cfailure\nor refusal by Congress to make the necessary appropriation\nwould not defeat the obligation, and the party entitled to\npayment would most likely be able to recover in a lawsuit.\u201d\nId., at 2\u20135; see also, e.g., Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt,\n543 U. S. 631, 636\u2013638 (2005) (rejecting the Government\u2019s\nargument that it is legally bound by its contractual promise\nto pay \u201cif, and only if, Congress appropriated sufficient\nfunds\u201d); Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U. S. 182,\n191 (2012) (\u201cAlthough the agency itself cannot disburse\nfunds beyond those appropriated to it, the Government\u2019s\n\u2018valid obligations will remain enforceable in the courts\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting 2 GAO Redbook 6\u201317 (2d ed. 1992)).\n   Congress can also create an obligation directly by statute,\nwithout also providing details about how it must be satis-\nfied. Consider, for example, United States v. Langston, 118\nU. S. 389 (1886). In that case, Congress had enacted a stat-\nute fixing an official\u2019s annual salary at \u201c$7,500 from the\ndate of the creation of his office.\u201d Id., at 394. Years later,\nhowever, Congress failed to appropriate enough funds to\npay the full amount, prompting the officer to sue for the re-\nmainder. Id., at 393. Understanding that Congress had\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncreated the obligation by statute, this Court held that a\nsubsequent failure to appropriate enough funds neither\n\u201cabrogated [n]or suspended\u201d the Government\u2019s pre-existing\ncommitment to pay. Id., at 394. The Court thus affirmed\njudgment for the officer for the balance owed. Ibid.5\n   The GAO shares this view. As the Redbook explains, if\nCongress created an obligation by statute without detailing\nhow it will be paid, \u201can agency could presumably meet a\nfunding shortfall by such measures as making prorated\npayments.\u201d GAO Redbook 2\u201336, n. 39. But \u201csuch actions\nwould be only temporary pending receipt of sufficient funds\nto honor the underlying obligation\u201d and \u201c[t]he recipient\nwould remain legally entitled to the balance.\u201d Ibid. Thus,\nthe GAO warns, although a \u201cfailure to appropriate\u201d funds\n\u201cwill prevent administrative agencies from making pay-\nment,\u201d that failure \u201cis unlikely to prevent recovery by way\nof a lawsuit.\u201d Id., at 2\u201363 (citing, e.g., Langston, 118 U. S.,\nat 394).\n   Put succinctly, Congress can create an obligation directly\nthrough statutory language.\n                             B\n  Section 1342 imposed a legal duty of the United States\nthat could mature into a legal liability through the insurers\u2019\nactions\u2014namely, their participating in the healthcare\nexchanges.\n  This conclusion flows from \u00a71342\u2019s express terms and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Government suggests that Langston is irrelevant because that\n\ncase predates the Judgment Fund, cf. n. 3, supra, meaning that the Court\n\u201chad no occasion\u201d to determine whether the statute at issue \u201cauthorized\na money-damages remedy\u201d against the Government, Brief for United\nStates 30. But by affirming a judgment against the United States, Lang-\nston necessarily confirmed the Government\u2019s obligation to pay independ-\nent of a specific appropriation. What remedies ensure that the Govern-\nment makes good on its duty to pay is a separate question that we take\nup below. See Part IV, infra.\n\f12 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v.

Section 1342 uses the com-\nmand three times: The HHS Secretary \u201cshall establish and\nadminister\u201d the Risk Corridors program from 2014 to 2016,\n\u201cshall provide\u201d for payments according to a precise statu-\ntory formula, and \u201cshall pay\u201d insurers for losses exceeding\nthe statutory threshold. \u00a7\u00a71342(a), (b)(1), 114 Stat. 211, 42\nU.

In \u00a71341 (a reinsurance program) and\n\u00a71343 (a risk-adjustment program), the Affordable Care Act\ndifferentiates between when the HHS Secretary \u201cshall\u201d\ntake certain actions and when she \u201cmay\u201d exercise discre-\ntion.     See \u00a71341(b)(2), 124 Stat. 209, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a718061(b)(2) (\u201c[T]he Secretary . . . shall include\u201d a formula\nthat \u201cmay be designed\u201d in multiple ways); \u00a71343(b), 124\nStat. 212, 42 U. S.

Yet Congress\nchose mandatory terms for \u00a71342. \u201cWhen,\u201d as is the case\nhere, Congress \u201cdistinguishes between \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018shall,\u2019 it\nis generally clear that \u2018shall\u2019 imposes a mandatory duty.\u201d\nKingdomware, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n   Nothing in \u00a71342 requires the Risk Corridors program to\nbe budget neutral, either. Nor does the text suggest that\nthe Secretary\u2019s payments to unprofitable plans pivoted on\nprofitable plans\u2019 payments to the Secretary, or that a par-\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

Thus, without \u201cany indication\u201d that \u00a71342 allows the\nGovernment to lessen its obligation, we must \u201cgive effect to\n[Section 1342\u2019s] plain command.\u201d Lexecon, 523 U. S., at 35.\nThat is, the statute meant what it said: The Government\n\u201cshall pay\u201d the sum that \u00a71342 prescribes.6\n                              C\n  The Government does not contest that \u00a71342\u2019s plain\nterms appeared to create an obligation to pay whatever\namount the statutory formula provides. It insists instead\nthat the Appropriations Clause, Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 7, and the\nAnti-Deficiency Act, 31 U. S. C. \u00a71341, \u201cqualified\u201d that obli-\ngation by making \u201cHHS\u2019s payments contingent on appropri-\nations by Congress.\u201d Brief for United States 20. \u201cBecause\nCongress did not appropriate funds beyond the amounts\ncollected\u201d from profitable plans, this argument goes, \u201cHHS\u2019s\nstatutory duty [to pay unprofitable plans] extended only to\ndisbursing those collected amounts.\u201d Id., at 24\u201325.\n  That does not follow. Neither the Appropriations Clause\nnor the Anti-Deficiency Act addresses whether Congress it-\nself can create or incur an obligation directly by statute.\nRather, both provisions constrain how federal employees\nand officers may make or authorize payments without ap-\npropriations. See U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 7 (requiring an\n\u201cAppropriatio[n] made by Law\u201d before money may \u201cbe\ndrawn\u201d to satisfy a payment obligation); 31 U. S.

In the agencies\u2019\nview, the Risk Corridors program was \u201cnot statutorily required to be\nbudget neutral\u201d and instead required HHS to \u201cremit payments\u201d\n\u201c[r]egardless of the balance of payments and receipts.\u201d 78 Fed.

S., at 197 (quot-\ning Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546 (1892)). If\nanything, the Anti-Deficiency Act confirms that Congress\ncan create obligations without contemporaneous funding\nsources: That Act\u2019s prohibitions give way \u201cas specified\u201d or\n\u201cauthorized\u201d by \u201cany other provision of law.\u201d 31 U.

Here, the Government\u2019s obligation was author-\nized by the Risk Corridors statute.\n  And contrary to the Government\u2019s view, \u00a71342\u2019s\nobligation-creating language does not turn on whether Con-\ngress expressly provided \u201cbudget authority\u201d before appro-\npriating funds. Budget authority is an agency\u2019s power \u201cpro-\nvided by Federal law to incur financial obligations,\u201d 88 Stat.\n297, 2 U. S.

As\nexplained above, Congress usually gives budget authority\nthrough an appropriations Act or by expressly granting an\nagency authority to contract for the Government. See GAO\nRedbook 2\u20131 to 2\u20135. But budget authority is not necessary\nfor Congress itself to create an obligation by statute. See\nLangston, 118 U. S., at 394; cf. Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S.\n811, 815 (1997) (treating legal obligations of the Govern-\nment as distinct from budget authority).\n  The Government\u2019s arguments also conflict with well-\nsettled principles of statutory interpretation.

But that language ap-\npears nowhere in \u00a71342, even though Congress could have\nexpressly limited an obligation to available appropriations\nor specific dollar amounts.

S. 509, 515\n(1914); accord, GAO Redbook 2\u201363 (\u201cThe mere failure\nto appropriate sufficient funds is not enough\u201d). The ques-\ntion, then, is whether the appropriations riders manifestly\nrepealed or discharged the Government\u2019s uncapped\nobligation.\n   Langston confirms that the appropriations riders did nei-\nther. Recall that in Langston, Congress had established a\nstatutory obligation to pay a salary of $7,500, yet later ap-\npropriated a lesser amount. 118 U. S., at 393\u2013394. This\nCourt held that Congress did not \u201cabrogat[e] or suspen[d]\u201d\nthe salary-fixing statute by \u201csubsequent enactments [that]\nmerely appropriated a less amount\u201d than necessary to pay,\nbecause the appropriations bill lacked \u201cwords that ex-\npressly or by clear implication modified or repealed the pre-\nvious law.\u201d Id., at 394.\n   Vulte reaffirmed that a mere failure to appropriate does\nnot repeal or discharge an obligation to pay. At issue there\nwas whether certain appropriations Acts had repealed a\n\f18 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nGovernment obligation to pay bonuses to military service-\nmen. 233 U. S., at 511\u2013512. A 1902 statute had provided a\n10 percent bonus to officers serving outside the contiguous\nUnited States, but in 1906 and 1907, Congress enacted ap-\npropriations funding the bonuses for officers \u201cexcept [those\nin] P[ue]rto Rico and Hawaii.\u201d Id., at 512. Then, in 1908,\nCongress enacted a statute stating \u201c \u2018[t]hat the increase of\npay . . . shall be as now provided by law.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 513. When\nLieutenant Nelson Vulte sought a bonus for his service in\nPuerto Rico from 1908 to 1909, the Government refused,\ncontending that the appropriations Acts had impliedly re-\npealed its obligation altogether.\n    Relying on Langston, Vulte rejected that argument. \u201c[I]t\nis to be remembered,\u201d the Court wrote, that the alleged\nrepeals \u201cwere in appropriation acts and no words were used\nto indicate any other purpose than the disbursement of a\nsum of money for the particular fiscal years.\u201d 233 U. S., at\n514. At most, the appropriations had \u201ctemporarily sus-\npend[ed]\u201d payments, but they did not use \u201c \u2018the most clear\nand positive terms\u2019 \u201d required to \u201cmodif[y] or repea[l]\u201d the\nGovernment\u2019s obligation itself. Id., at 514\u2013515 (quoting\nMinis v. United States, 15 Pet. 423, 445 (1841)). Because\nthe Government had failed to show that repeal was the only\n\u2018 \u201creasonable interpretation\u2019 \u201d of the appropriation Acts, the\nobligation persisted. 233 U. S., at 515 (quoting Minis, 15\nPet., at 445).\n    The parallels among Langston, Vulte, and these cases are\nclear. Here, like in Langston and Vulte, Congress \u201cmerely\nappropriated a less amount\u201d than that required to satisfy\nthe Government\u2019s obligation, without \u201cexpressly or by clear\nimplication modif[ying]\u201d it. Langston, 118 U. S., at 394; see\nalso Vulte, 233 U. S., at 515. The riders stated that \u201c[n]one\nof the funds made available by this Act,\u201d as opposed to any\nother sources of funds, \u201cmay be used for payments under\u201d\nthe Risk Corridors statute. \u00a7227, 128 Stat. 2491; accord,\n\u00a7225, 129 Stat. 2624; \u00a7223, 131 Stat. 543.

S., at 514. And especially because the Gov-\nernment had already begun incurring the prior year\u2019s obli-\ngation each time Congress enacted a rider, reasonable (and\nnonrepealing) interpretations exist. Indeed, finding a re-\npeal in these circumstances would raise serious questions\nwhether the appropriations riders retroactively impaired\ninsurers\u2019 rights to payment. See Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 511 U. S. 244, 265\u2013266, 280 (1994); see also GAO\nRedbook 1\u201361 to 1\u201362.\n   The relevant agencies\u2019 responses to the riders also under-\nmine the case for an implied repeal here. Had Congress\n\u201cclearly expressed\u201d its intent to repeal, one might have ex-\npected HHS or CMS to signal the sea change. Morton, 417\nU. S., at 551. But even after Congress enacted the first\nrider, the agencies reiterated that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act\nrequires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers,\u201d 80\nFed. Reg. 10779, and that \u201cHHS w[ould] record risk corri-\ndors payments due as an obligation of the United States\nGovernment for which full payment is required,\u201d CMS, Risk\nCorridors Payments for 2015, at 1. They understood that\nprofitable insurers\u2019 payments to the Government would not\ndispel the Secretary\u2019s obligation to pay unprofitable insur-\ners, even \u201cin the event of a shortfall.\u201d Ibid.\n   Given the Court\u2019s potent presumption in the appropria-\ntions context, an implied-repeal-by-rider must be made of\nsterner stuff.\n                              B\n  To be sure, this Court\u2019s implied-repeal precedents reveal\ntwo situations where the Court has deemed appropriations\nmeasures irreconcilable with statutory obligations to pay.\nBut neither one applies here.\n  The first line of cases involved appropriations bills that,\nwithout expressly invoking words of \u201crepeal,\u201d reached that\n\f20 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\noutcome by completely revoking or suspending the underly-\ning obligation before the Government began incurring it.\nSee United States v.

Will concluded\nthat Congress had canceled an obligation to pay cost-of-\nliving raises through appropriations bills that bluntly\nstated that future raises \u201c \u2018shall not take effect\u2019 \u201d or that re-\nstricted funds from \u201c \u2018this Act or any other Act.\u2019 \u201d 449 U. S.,\nat 206\u2013207, 223.8 Likewise, Dickerson held that a series of\nappropriations bills repealed an obligation to pay military-\nreenlistment bonuses due in particular fiscal years. See\n310 U. S., at 561. One enactment \u201c \u2018hereby suspended\u2019 \u201d the\nbonuses before they took effect, and another \u201ccontinued\u201d\nthis suspension for additional years, providing that \u201c \u2018no\npart of any appropriation in this or any other Act for the\n[next] fiscal year . . . shall be available for the payment [of\nthe bonuses] notwithstanding\u2019 \u201d the statute creating the\nGovernment\u2019s obligation to pay. Id., at 555\u2013557.\n   Here, by contrast, the appropriations riders did not use\nthe kind of \u201cshall not take effect\u201d language decisive in Will.\nSee 449 U. S., at 222\u2013223. Nor did the riders purport\nto \u201csuspen[d]\u201d \u00a71342 prospectively or to foreclose funds\nfrom \u201cany other Act\u201d \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d \u00a71342\u2019s money-\nmandating text. Dickerson, 310 U. S., at 556\u2013557; see also\nWill, 449 U. S., at 206\u2013207. Neither Will nor Dickerson sup-\nports the Federal Circuit\u2019s implied-repeal holding.\n   The second strand of precedent turned on provisions that\nreformed statutory payment formulas in ways \u201cirreconcila-\nble\u201d with the original methods. See United States v. Mitch-\nell, 109 U. S. 146, 150 (1883); see also United States v.\nFisher, 109 U. S. 143, 145\u2013146 (1883). In Mitchell, an ap-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Still, Will held unconstitutional the changes that purported to reduce\n\nthe Government\u2019s payment obligations after the obligation-creating stat-\nutes had already taken effect.

S., at 147, 149. And in\nFisher, Congress altered an obligation to pay judges $3,000\nper year by providing that a lesser appropriation would be\n\u201c \u2018in full compensation\u2019 \u201d for services rendered in the next\nfiscal year. 109 U. S., at 144.9\n    The appropriations bills here created no such conflict as\nin Mitchell and Fisher. The riders did not reference \u00a71342\u2019s\npayment formula at all, let alone \u201cirreconcilabl[y]\u201d change\nit. Mitchell, 109 U. S., at 150. Nor did they provide that\nRisk Corridors payments from profitable plans would be\n\u201c \u2018in full compensation\u2019 \u201d of the Government\u2019s obligation to\nunprofitable plans. Fisher, 109 U. S., at 146. Instead, the\nriders here must be taken at face value: as a \u201cmere omission\nto appropriate a sufficient sum.\u201d Vulte, 233 U. S., at 515.\nCongress could have used the kind of language we have\nheld to effect a repeal or suspension\u2014indeed, it did so in\nother provisions of the relevant appropriations bills. See,\ne.g., \u00a7716, 128 Stat. 2163 (\u201cNone of the funds appropriated\nor otherwise made available by this or any other Act shall\nbe used . . . \u201d); \u00a7714, 129 Stat. 2275 (same); \u00a7714, 131 Stat.\n168 (same). But for the Risk Corridors program, it did not.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The Federal Circuit has also recognized that Congress may override\n\na statutory payment formula through an appropriation that expressly\nearmarks a lesser amount for that payment obligation in the upcoming\nfiscal year. See Highland Falls-Fort Montgomery Central School Dist. v.\nUnited States, 48 F. 3d 1166, 1169\u20131171 (1995); see also GAO Redbook\n2\u201362 (discussing Highland Falls and noting that earmarking a lesser\namount can create an \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d with a statutory payment\nformula). Perhaps because these cases do not involve an earmark to sat-\nisfy an incompatible payment formula, the Federal Circuit did not rely\non Highland Falls below.\n\f22 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               C\n  We also find unpersuasive the only pieces of legislative\nhistory that the Federal Circuit cited. According to the\nCourt of Appeals, a floor statement and an unpublished\nGAO letter provided \u201cclear intent\u201d to cancel or \u201csuspend\u201d\nthe Government\u2019s Risk Corridors obligation. See 892 F. 3d,\nat 1318\u20131319, 1325\u20131326. We doubt that either source\ncould ever evince the kind of clear congressional intent re-\nquired to repeal a statutory obligation through an appropri-\nations rider. See United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575\nU. S. 402, 412 (2015). But even if they could, they did not\ndo so here.\n  The floor statement (which Congress adopted as an \u201cex-\nplanatory statement\u201d) does not cross the clear-expression\nthreshold. See 160 Cong. Rec. 17805, 18307 (2014); see also\n\u00a74, 128 Stat. 2132. That statement interpreted an HHS\nregulation as saying that \u201cthe risk corridor program will be\nbudget neutral, meaning the federal government will never\npay out more than it collects.\u201d 160 Cong. Rec., at 18307.10\nBut that misunderstands the referenced regulation, which\nprovided only that HHS \u201cproject[ed]\u201d that the program\nwould be budget neutral and that the agency \u201cintend[ed]\u201d\nto treat it that way, while making clear that \u201cit [was] diffi-\ncult to estimate\u201d the \u201caggregate risk corridors payments\nand charges at [the] time.\u201d 79 Fed. Reg. 13829. HHS\u2019 goals\ndid not alter its prior interpretation that the Risk Corridors\nprogram was \u201cnot statutorily required to be budget neu-\ntral.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. 15473. And neither the floor statement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The statement provides in full:\n\n  \u201cIn 2014, HHS issued a regulation stating that the risk corridor\nprogram will be budget neutral, meaning that the federal government\nwill never pay out more than it collects from issuers over the three year\nperiod risk corridors are in effect.

In it, the GAO re-\nsponded to two legislators\u2019 inquiry by identifying two\nsources of available funding for the first year of Risk Corri-\ndors payments: CMS\u2019 appropriations for the 2014 fiscal year\nand profitable insurance plans\u2019 payments to the Secretary.\n892 F. 3d, at 1318; see also App. in No. 17\u20131994 (CA Fed.),\npp. 234\u2013240. Because the rider cut off the first source of\nfunds, the Federal Circuit inferred congressional intent \u201cto\ntemporarily cap\u201d the Government\u2019s payments \u201cat the\namount of payments\u201d profitable plans made \u201cfor each of the\napplicable years\u201d of the Risk Corridors program. 892 F. 3d,\nat 1325. That was error. The letter has little value because\nit appears nowhere in the legislative record. Perhaps for\nthat reason, the Government does not rely on it.\n                            IV\n  Having found that the Risk Corridors statute established\na valid yet unfulfilled Government obligation, this Court\nmust turn to a final question: Where does petitioners\u2019 law-\nsuit belong, and for what relief? We hold that petitioners\nproperly relied on the Tucker Act to sue for damages in the\nCourt of Federal Claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 In this implied-repeal context, it is also telling that Congress\n\nconsidered\u2014but did not enact\u2014bills containing the type of text that may\nhave satisfied the clear-expression rule. See e.g., Obamacare Taxpayer\nBailout Protection Act, S. 2214, 113th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a72 (2014) (\u201c \u2018[T]he\nSecretary shall ensure that payments out and payments in . . . are pro-\nvided for in amounts that the Secretary determines are necessary to re-\nduce to zero the cost . . . to the Federal Government of carrying out the\nprogram under this section\u2019 \u201d); Taxpayer Bailout Protection Act, S. 359,\n114th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a72 (2015) (\u201c \u2018The Secretary shall ensure that the\namount of payments to plans . . . does not exceed the amount of payments\nto the Secretary\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018shall proportionately decrease the amount of\npayments to plans\u2019 \u201d); Taxpayer Bailout Protection Act, H. R. 724, 114th\nCong., 1st Sess., \u00a72 (2015) (same).\n\f24 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v.

Navajo Nation, 556 U. S.\n287, 289 (2009). The Government has waived immunity for\ncertain damages suits in the Court of Federal Claims\nthrough the Tucker Act, 24 Stat. 505. See United States v.\nMitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 212 (1983). That statute permits\n\u201cclaim[s] against the United States founded either upon the\nConstitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an\nexecutive department, or upon any express or implied con-\ntract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliqui-\ndated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71491(a)(1).\n   The Tucker Act, however, does not create \u201csubstantive\nrights.\u201d Navajo Nation, 556 U. S., at 290. A plaintiff rely-\ning on the Tucker Act must premise her damages action on\n\u201cother sources of law,\u201d like \u201cstatutes or contracts.\u201d Ibid. For\nthat reason, \u201c[n]ot every claim invoking the Constitution, a\nfederal statute, or a regulation is cognizable under the\nTucker Act.\u201d Mitchell, 463 U. S., at 216. Nor will every\n\u201cfailure to perform an obligation . . . creat[e] a right to mon-\netary relief \u201d against the Government. United States v.\nBormes, 568 U. S. 6, 16 (2012).\n   To determine whether a statutory claim falls within the\nTucker Act\u2019s immunity waiver, we typically employ a \u201cfair\ninterpretation\u201d test. A statute creates a \u201cright capable of\ngrounding a claim within the waiver of sovereign immunity\nif, but only if, it \u2018can fairly be interpreted as mandating com-\npensation by the Federal Government for the damage sus-\ntained.\u2019 \u201d United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe,\n537 U. S. 465, 472 (2003) (quoting Mitchell, 463 U. S., at\n217)); see also Navajo Nation, 556 U. S., at 290 (\u201cThe other\nsource of law need not explicitly provide that the right or\nduty it creates is enforceable through a suit for damages\u201d).\nSatisfying this rubric is generally both necessary and suffi-\ncient to permit a Tucker Act suit for damages in the Court\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                      25\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nof Federal Claims. White Mountain Apache, 537 U. S., at\n472\u2013473.12\n  But there are two exceptions. The Tucker Act yields\nwhen the obligation-creating statute provides its own de-\ntailed remedies, or when the Administrative Procedure Act,\n60 Stat. 237, provides an avenue for relief. See Bormes, 568\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 Relying on Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275 (2001), the dissent\u2019s\n\nlogic suggests that a federal statute could never provide a cause of action\nfor damages absent magic words explicitly inviting suit. See post, at 2,\n4\u20137. We have repeatedly rejected that notion\u2014including in opinions\nwritten by Sandoval\u2019s author. See, e.g., United States v. Bormes, 568\nU. S. 6, 15\u201316 (2012); United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. 287, 290\n(2009). Not even Sandoval went as far as the dissent; that decision in-\nstead explained that \u201c[t]he judicial task is to interpret the statute Con-\ngress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not\njust a private right but also a private remedy.\u201d 532 U. S., at 286. That\nis precisely what the money-mandating inquiry does: It provides a frame-\nwork for determining when Congress has authorized a claim against the\nGovernment.\n   This framework also makes good sense. Cf. post, at 4. As the author\nof Sandoval explained, if a statutory obligation to pay money is manda-\ntory, then the congressionally conferred \u201cright to receive money,\u201d post, at\n8, n. 5, will typically display an intent to provide a damages remedy for\nthe defaulted amount, Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 923 (1988)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (a \u201cstatute commanding the payment of a specified\namount of money by the United States impliedly authorizes (absent\nother indication) a claim for damages in the defaulted amount\u201d). As this\nCourt recently observed, Congress enacted the Tucker Act to \u201csuppl[y]\nthe missing ingredient for an action against the United States for the\nbreach of monetary obligations not otherwise judicially enforceable.\u201d\nBormes, 568 U. S., at 12.\n   By the dissent\u2019s contrary suggestion, not only is a mandatory statutory\nobligation to pay meaningless, so too is a constitutional one. After all,\nthe Constitution did not \u201cexpressly create . . . a right of action,\u201d post, at\n3, when it mandated \u201cjust compensation\u201d for Government takings of pri-\nvate property for public use, Amdt. 5; see also First English Evangelical\nLutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304,\n315\u2013316 (1987). Although there is no express cause of action under the\nTakings Clause, aggrieved owners can sue through the Tucker Act under\nour case law. E.g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016\u2013\n1017 (1984) (citing United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 267 (1946)).\n\f26 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 13, 16; Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879,\n900\u2013908 (1988).\n                              B\n   Petitioners clear each hurdle: The Risk Corridors statute\nis fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for dam-\nages, and neither exception to the Tucker Act applies.\n                               1\n   Rarely has the Court determined whether a statute can\n\u201cfairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the\nFederal Government.\u201d Mitchell, 463 U. S., at 216\u2013217 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). Likely this is because so-\ncalled money-mandating provisions are uncommon, see M.\nSolomson, Court of Federal Claims: Jurisdiction, Practice,\nand Procedure 4\u201318 (2016), and because Congress has at its\ndisposal several blueprints for conditioning and limiting ob-\nligations, see n. 7, supra; see also GAO Redbook 2\u201322 to 2\u2013\n24, 2\u201354 to 2\u201358. But Congress used none of those tools in\n\u00a71342. The Risk Corridors statute is one of the rare laws\npermitting a damages suit in the Court of Federal Claims.\n   Here again \u00a71342\u2019s mandatory text is significant. Statu-\ntory \u201c \u2018shall pay\u2019 language\u201d often reflects congressional in-\ntent \u201cto create both a right and a remedy\u201d under the Tucker\nAct. Bowen, 487 U. S., at 906, n. 42; see also, e.g., id., at\n923 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201c[A] statute commanding the\npayment of a specified amount of money by the United\nStates impliedly authorizes (absent other indication) a\nclaim for damages in the defaulted amount\u201d); United States\nv.

In assessing Tucker Act actions,\nthis Court has distinguished statutes that \u201cattempt to com-\npensate a particular class of persons for past injuries or\nlabors\u201d from laws that \u201csubsidize future state expendi-\ntures.\u201d Bowen, 487 U. S., at 906, n. 42. (The first group\npermits Tucker Act suits; the second does not.) The Risk\nCorridors statute sits securely in the first category: It uses\na backwards-looking formula to compensate insurers for\nlosses incurred in providing healthcare coverage for the\nprior year.13\n                             2\n  Nor is there a separate remedial scheme supplanting the\nCourt of Federal Claims\u2019 power to adjudicate petitioners\u2019\nclaims.\n  True, the Tucker Act \u201cis displaced\u201d when \u201ca law assert-\nedly imposing monetary liability on the United States\ncontains its own judicial remedies.\u201d Bormes, 568 U. S., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 Despite agreeing that \u201c[t]he Court is correct\u201d on the case law, the\n\ndissent proposes supplemental briefing and re-argument. Post, at 4, 8.\nWe underscore, however, that all Members of this Court agree that to-\nday\u2019s cases do not break new doctrinal ground.\n      The Federal Circuit, moreover, concurs in our conclusion. 892 F. 3d,\n1311, 1320, n. 2 (2018) (holding that \u00a71342 \u201cis money-mandating for\n[Tucker Act] purposes\u201d (citing Greenlee County v. United States, 487\nF. 3d 871, 877 (CA Fed. 2007))). It also agrees with our analysis broadly,\nhaving held that \u201cshall pay\u201d language \u201cgenerally makes a statute money-\nmandating\u201d under the Tucker Act. Id., at 877 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Conversely, the Court of Appeals has concluded that a statute\nis not money mandating where the Government enjoys \u201ccomplete discre-\ntion\u201d in determining whether (and whom) to pay. See, e.g., Doe v. United\nStates, 463 F. 3d 1314, 1324 (2006) (noting that the statutory\nterm, \u201cmay,\u201d creates a rebuttable presumption that the \u201cstatute creates\ndiscretion\u201d).\n\f28 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n12. A plaintiff in that instance cannot rely on our \u201cfair\ninterpretation\u201d test, and instead must stick to the money-\nmandating statute\u2019s \u201cown text\u201d to \u201cdetermine whether the\ndamages liability Congress crafted extends to the Federal\nGovernment.\u201d Id., at 15\u201316. Examples include the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act, 84 Stat. 1127, and the Agricultural\nMarketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246. The former\nsuperseded the Tucker Act by creating a cause of action,\nimposing a statute of limitations, and providing subject-\nmatter jurisdiction in federal district courts. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71681n, 1681o, 1681p; Bormes, 568 U. S., at 15. And the\nlatter did so by allowing aggrieved parties to petition the\nSecretary of Agriculture and by paving a path for judicial\nreview. See 7 U. S. C. \u00a7608c(15); Horne v. Department of\nAgriculture, 569 U. S. 513, 527 (2013).\n   Unlike those statutes, however, the Affordable Care Act\ndid not establish a comparable remedial scheme. Nor has\nthe Government identified one. So this exception to the\nTucker Act is no barrier here.\n   Neither does the Administrative Procedure Act bar peti-\ntioners\u2019 Tucker Act suit. To be sure, in Bowen, this Court\nheld in the Medicaid context that a State properly sued the\nHHS Secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act\n(not the Tucker Act) in district court (not the Court of Fed-\neral Claims) for failure to make statutorily required pay-\nments. See 487 U. S., at 882\u2013887, 901\u2013905.\n   But Bowen is distinguishable on several scores. First, the\nrelief requested there differed materially from what peti-\ntioners pursue here. In Bowen, the State did not seek\nmoney damages, but instead sued for prospective declara-\ntory and injunctive relief to clarify the extent of the Govern-\nment\u2019s ongoing obligations under the Medicaid program.\nUnlike \u00a71342, which \u201cprovide[s] compensation for specific\ninstances of past injuries or labors,\u201d id., at 901, n. 31, the\npertinent Medicaid provision was a \u201cgrant-in-aid program,\u201d\nwhich \u201cdirect[ed] the Secretary . . . to subsidize future state\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           29\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpenditures,\u201d id., at 906, n. 42. Thus, the suit in Bowen\n\u201cwas not merely for past due sums, but for an injunction to\ncorrect the method of calculating payments going forward.\u201d\nGreat-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.\n204, 212 (2002). And because the Court of Federal Claims\n\u201cdoes not have the general equitable powers of a district\ncourt to grant prospective relief,\u201d 487 U. S., at 905, the\nCourt reasoned that Bowen belonged in district court.\n   Second, the parties\u2019 relationship in Bowen also differs\nfrom the one implicated here. The State had employed the\nAdministrative Procedure Act in Bowen because of the liti-\ngants\u2019 \u201ccomplex ongoing relationship,\u201d which made it im-\nportant that a district court adjudicate future disputes. Id.,\nat 905; see also id., at 900, n. 31. The Court added that the\nAdministrative Procedure Act \u201cis tailored\u201d to \u201c[m]anaging\nthe relationships between States and the Federal Govern-\nment that occur over time and that involve constantly shift-\ning balance sheets,\u201d while the Tucker Act is suited to\n\u201cremedy[ing] particular categories of past injuries or labors\nfor which various federal statutes provide compensation.\u201d\nId., at 904\u2013905, n. 39.\n   These observations confirm that petitioners properly\nsued the Government in the Court of Federal Claims. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 prayer for relief under the Risk Corridors statute\nlooks nothing like the requested redress in Bowen. Peti-\ntioners do not ask for prospective, nonmonetary relief to\nclarify future obligations; they seek specific sums already\ncalculated, past due, and designed to compensate for com-\npleted labors. The Risk Corridors statute and Tucker Act\nallow them that remedy. And because the Risk Corridors\nprogram expired years ago, this litigation presents no spe-\ncial concern about managing a complex ongoing relation-\n\f30 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nship or tracking ever-changing accounting sheets. Petition-\ners\u2019 suit thus lies in the Tucker Act\u2019s heartland.14\n                               V\n  In establishing the temporary Risk Corridors program,\nCongress created a rare money-mandating obligation re-\nquiring the Federal Government to make payments under\n\u00a71342\u2019s formula. And by failing to appropriate enough\nsums for payments already owed, Congress did simply that\nand no more: The appropriation bills neither repealed nor\ndischarged \u00a71342\u2019s unique obligation. Lacking other statu-\ntory paths to relief, and absent a Bowen barrier, petitioners\nmay seek to collect payment through a damages action in\nthe Court of Federal Claims.15\n  These holdings reflect a principle as old as the Nation it-\nself: The Government should honor its obligations. Soon\nafter ratification, Alexander Hamilton stressed this insight\nas a cornerstone of fiscal policy. \u201cStates,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwho\nobserve their engagements . . . are respected and trusted:\nwhile the reverse is the fate of those . . . who pursue an op-\nposite conduct.\u201d Report Relative to a Provision for the Sup-\nport of Public Credit (Jan. 9, 1790), in 6 Papers of Alexander\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 The dissent concedes that there may \u201cbe some sharply defined cate-\n\ngories of claims that may be properly asserted\u201d through the Tucker\nAct \u201csimply as a matter of precedent.\u201d Post, at 6, and nn. 3, 4 (citing\ntakings, breach-of-contract, failure-to-pay-compensation, and breach-of-\nfiduciary-duty claims as examples). Petitioners\u2019 claim\u2014breach of an\nunambiguous statutory promise to pay for services rendered to the\nGovernment\u2014fits easily within those precedents. The only differences\nthe dissent seems to assert here are that the dollar figure is higher and\nthat petitioners do not deserve a \u201cbailout\u201d for their \u201cbet\u201d that the Federal\nGovernment would comply with federal law. Post, at 2, 3, 7; but cf., e.g.,\n79 Fed. Reg. 30260 (assuring insurers with \u201cconcerns that risk corridors\ncollections may not be sufficient to fully fund risk corridors payments\u201d\nthat the Government would still pay). Our analysis in Tucker Act cases\nhas never revolved on such results-oriented reasoning.\n   15 Having found that the Risk Corridors statute is a money-mandating\n\nprovision for which a Tucker Act suit lies, we need not resolve petitioners\u2019\nalternative arguments for recovery based on an implied-in-fact contract\ntheory or under the Takings Clause.\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

These\ncompanies chose to participate in an Affordable Care Act\nprogram that they thought would be profitable. I assume\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             3\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfor the sake of argument that the Court is correct in holding\nthat \u00a71342 of the Affordable Care Act created an obligation\nthat was not rescinded by subsequent appropriations rid-\ners. Thus, for present purposes, I do not dispute the thrust\nof the analysis in Parts I\u2013III of the opinion of the Court.\n                               I\n  My disagreement concerns the critical question that the\nCourt decides in the remainder of its opinion. In order for\npetitioners to recover, federal law must provide a right of\naction for damages. The Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71491, un-\nder which petitioners brought suit, provides a waiver of sov-\nereign immunity and a grant of federal-court jurisdiction,\nbut it does not create any right of action. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. 287, 290 (2009). Nor does\nany other federal statute expressly create such a right of\naction. The Court, however, holds that \u00a71342 of the Afford-\nable Care Act does so by implication. Because \u00a71342 says\nthat the United States \u201cshall pay\u201d for the companies\u2019 losses,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a718062(b)(1), the Court finds it is proper to infer\na private right of action to recover for these losses.\n  This is an important step. Under the Court\u2019s decision,\nbillions of taxpayer dollars will be turned over to insurance\ncompanies that bet unsuccessfully on the success of the pro-\ngram in question. This money will have to be paid even\nthough Congress has pointedly declined to appropriate\nmoney for that purpose.\n  Not only will today\u2019s decision have a massive immediate\nimpact, its potential consequences go much further. The\nCourt characterizes provisions like \u00a71342 as \u201crare,\u201d ante, at\n26, but the phrase the \u201cSecretary shall pay\u201d\u2013\u2013the language\nthat the Court construes as creating a cause of action\u2013\u2013ap-\npears in many other federal statutes.\n                           II\n  The Court concludes that it is proper for us to recognize\n\f4 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\na right of action to collect damages from the United States\nunder any statute that \u201c \u2018can fairly be interpreted as man-\ndating compensation.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 24. The Court is correct\nthat prior cases have set out this test, but as the Court\nacknowledges, we have \u201c[r]arely\u201d had to determine whether\nit was met. See ante, at 26. And we have certainly never\ninferred such a right in a case even remotely like these.\n   Nor has any prior case provided a reasoned explanation\nof the basis for the test. In United States v. Testan, 424\nU. S. 392 (1976), the Court simply lifted the language in\nquestion from an opinion of the old United States Court of\nClaims before holding that the test was not met in the case\nat hand. Id., at 400\u2013402 (citing Eastport S. S. Corp. v.\nUnited States, 178 Ct. Cl. 599, 607, 372 F. 2d 1002, 1009\n(1967)). The Court of Claims opinion, in turn, did not ex-\nplain the origin or basis for this test. See id., at 607, 372\nF. 2d, at 1009. And not only have later cases parroted this\nlanguage, they have expanded it. In United States v. White\nMountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 473 (2003) (empha-\nsis added), the Court wrote that \u201c[i]t is enough . . . that a\nstatute . . . be reasonably amenable to the reading that it\nmandates a right of recovery in damages.\u201d\n   Despite the uncertain foundation of this test, our post-\nTestan decisions have simply taken it as a given. I would\nnot continue that practice. Before holding that this test re-\nquires the payment of billions of dollars that Congress has\npointedly refused to appropriate, we ought to be sure that\nthere is a reasonable basis for this test. And that is ques-\ntionable.2\n                           III\n  There is obvious tension between what the Court now\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Moreover, there is at least an argument that the Court\u2019s application\n\nof the test here is itself in conflict with United States v. Testan, 424 U. S.\n392, 400 (1976), which also directed that the \u201cgrant of a right of action\nmust be made with specificity.\u201d\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Take the statute at issue in our Comcast decision.\nThat provision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71981(a), states:\n    \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States\n    shall have the same right in every State and Territory\n    to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give\n    evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws\n    and proceedings for the security of persons and prop-\n    erty as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d (Emphasis\n    added.)\nOur opinion in Comcast suggested that we might not find\nthis \u201cshall have\u201d language sufficient to justify the recogni-\ntion of a damages claim if the question came before us today\nas a matter of first impression. See 589 U. S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 5\u20136). But if that is so, how can we reach a dif-\nferent conclusion with respect to the \u201cshall pay\u201d language\nin \u00a71342 of the Affordable Care Act? Similarly, the Fourth\nAmendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be\nsecure . . . against unreasonable . . . seizures . . . shall not\nbe violated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Can this rights-mandating\nlanguage be distinguished from what the Court describes\nas the \u201cmoney-mandating\u201d language found in \u00a71342? See\nHern\u00e1ndez, 589 U. S., at ___, ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8, 19\u201320)\n(rejecting extension of Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcot-\nics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), to Fourth Amendment\nclaim arising in a \u201cnew context\u201d).\n    One might argue that the assumptions underlying the en-\nactment of the Tucker Act justify our exercising more lee-\nway in inferring rights of action that may be asserted under\nthat Act. When the Tucker Act was enacted in 1887, Con-\ngress undoubtedly assumed that the federal courts would\n\u201c \u2018[r]ais[e] up causes of action,\u2019 \u201d Alexander v. Sandoval, 532\nU. S. 275, 287 (2001), in the manner of a common-law court.\nAt that time, federal courts often applied general common\n\f6 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlaw. But since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),\nthe federal courts have lacked this power. Yet the \u201cmoney-\nmandating\u201d test that the Court applies today, ante, at 26\u2013\n27, and n. 13, bears a disquieting resemblance to the sort of\ntest that a common-law court might use in deciding\nwhether to create a new cause of action. To be sure, some\nof the claims asserted under the Tucker Act, most notably\ncontract claims, are governed by the new federal common\nlaw that applies in limited areas involving \u201c \u2018uniquely fed-\neral interests.\u2019 \u201d Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487\nU. S. 500, 504 (1988); see also Testan, 424 U. S., at 400.\nAnd the recognition of an implied right to recover on such\nclaims is thus easy to reconcile with the post-Erie regime.\nThere may also be some sharply defined categories of\nclaims3 that may be properly asserted simply as a matter of\nprecedent.4 But the exercise of common-law power in cases\nlike the ones now before us is a different matter.\n   An argument based on Congress\u2019s assumptions in enact-\ning the Tucker Act would present a question that is similar\nto one we have confronted under the Alien Tort Statute\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Takings claims are an example. During the period when federal\n\ncourts applied general common law, such claims were brought under the\nTucker Act, apparently on the theory of implied contract. See, e.g., Hur-\nley v. Kincaid, 285 U. S. 95, 104 (1932); United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S.\n445, 458\u2013459 (1903). But the Court rejected the argument that a takings\nclaim could be based \u201cexclusively on the Constitution, without reference\nto any statute of the United States, or to any contract arising under an\nact of Congress.\u201d Hooe v. United States, 218 U. S. 322, 335 (1910).\n  4 Compare Testan, 424 U. S., at 400 (suggesting that private remedies\n\nmight be available for contract claims); United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU.

Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 713 (2004). Our\ncases have assumed that the ATS was enacted on the as-\nsumption that it would provide a jurisdictional basis for\nplaintiffs to assert common-law claims, see id., at 724, but\nour recent cases have held that even there, we should exer-\ncise \u201cgreat caution\u201d before recognizing any new claims not\ncreated by statute, id., at 728. See also Jesner, 584 U. S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 18\u201319); Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petro-\nleum Co., 569 U. S. 108, 116\u2013117 (2013). There is every\nreason to believe that a similar caution should guide cases\nunder the Tucker Act\u2014especially when billions of dollars\nof federal funds are at stake. The money-mandating test\nthat the Court applies here is in stark tension with this\nprecedent.\n   Despite its importance, the legitimacy of inferring a right\nof action under \u00a71342 has not received much attention in\nthese cases. The Federal Circuit addressed the question in\npassing in a footnote, 892 F. 3d 1311, 1320, n. 2 (2018), and\nin this Court, the briefing and argument focused primarily\non other issues. No attempt was made to reconcile our ap-\nproach to inferring rights of action in Tucker Act cases with\nour broader jurisprudence.\n   I am unwilling to endorse the Court\u2019s holding in these\ncases without understanding how the \u201cmoney-mandating\u201d\ntest on which the Court relies fits into our general approach\nto the recognition of implied rights of action.5 Because the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The Court claims that the logic of this opinion \u201csuggests that a federal\n\nstatute could never provide a cause of action for damages absent magic\nwords explicitly inviting suit.\u201d Ante, at 25, n. 12. But all I suggest is\nthat the Court request briefing on the question of inferring causes of ac-\ntion to recover damages under the Tucker Act. The Court makes no effort\nto explain how the test it applies here can be reconciled with our general\napproach to inferring private rights of action but is apparently content\nto allow that inconsistency to remain.\n\f8 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v.

UNITED\n                  STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 18\u20131023. Argued December 10, 2019\u2014Decided April 27, 2020*\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established online ex-\n  changes where insurers could sell their healthcare plans. The now-\n  expired \u201cRisk Corridors\u201d program aimed to limit the plans\u2019 profits and\n  losses during the exchanges\u2019 first three years (2014 through 2016). See\n  \u00a71342, 124 Stat. 211. Section 1342 set out a formula for computing a\n  plan\u2019s gains or losses at the end of each year, providing that eligible\n  profitable plans \u201cshall pay\u201d the Secretary of the Department of Health\n  and Human Services (HHS), while the Secretary \u201cshall pay\u201d eligible\n  unprofitable plans. The Act neither appropriated funds for these\n  yearly payments nor limited the amounts that the Government might\n  pay. Nor was the program required to be budget neutral. Each year,\n  the Government owed more money to unprofitable insurers than prof-\n  itable insurers owed to the Government, resulting in a total deficit of\n  more than $12 billion. And at the end of each year, the appropriations\n  bills for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in-\n  cluded a rider preventing CMS from using the funds for Risk Corridors\n  payments. Petitioners\u2014four health-insurance companies that claim\n  losses under the program\u2014sued the Federal Government for damages\n  in the Court of Federal Claims. Invoking the Tucker Act, they alleged\n  that \u00a71342 obligated the Government to pay the full amount of their\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 18\u20131028, Moda Health Plan, Inc. v.

Only one petitioner prevailed in the\n trial courts, and the Federal Circuit ruled for the Government in each\n appeal, holding that \u00a71342 had initially created a Government obliga-\n tion to pay the full amounts, but that the subsequent appropriations\n riders impliedly \u201crepealed or suspended\u201d that obligation.\nHeld:\n    1. The Risk Corridors statute created a Government obligation to\n pay insurers the full amount set out in \u00a71342\u2019s formula. Pp. 9\u201316.\n       (a) The Government may incur an obligation directly through\n statutory language, without also providing details about how the obli-\n gation must be satisfied. See United States v. Langston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91707\"><a href=\"/opinion/91707/united-states-v-langston/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n Pp. 9\u201311.\n       (b) Section 1342 imposed a legal duty of the United States that\n could mature into a legal liability through the insurers\u2019 participation\n in the exchanges. This conclusion flows from the express terms and\n context of \u00a71342, which imposed an obligation by using the mandatory\n term \u201cshall.\u201d The section\u2019s mandatory nature is underscored by the\n adjacent provisions, which differentiate between when the HHS Sec-\n retary \u201cshall\u201d take certain actions and when she \u201cmay\u201d exercise discre-\n tion. See \u00a7\u00a71341(b)(2), 1343(b). Section 1342 neither requires the Risk\n Corridors program to be budget-neutral nor suggests that the Secre-\n tary\u2019s payments to unprofitable plans pivoted on profitable plans\u2019 pay-\n ments to the Secretary or that a partial payment would satisfy the\n Government\u2019s whole obligation. It thus must be given its plain mean-\n ing: The Government \u201cshall pay\u201d the sum prescribed by \u00a71342. Pp. 11\u2013\n 13.\n       (c) Contrary to the Government\u2019s contention, neither the Appro-\n priations Clause nor the Anti-Deficiency Act addresses whether Con-\n gress itself can create or incur an obligation directly by statute. Nor\n does \u00a71342\u2019s obligation-creating language turn on whether Congress\n expressly provided budget authority before appropriating funds. The\n Government\u2019s arguments also conflict with well-settled principles of\n statutory interpretation. That \u00a71342 contains no language limiting\n the obligation to the availability of appropriations, while Congress ex-\n pressly used such limiting language in other Affordable Care Act pro-\n visions, indicates that Congress intended a different meaning in\n \u00a71342.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nafford it. The Affordable Care Act did this by, among other\nthings, providing tax credits to help people buy insurance\nand establishing online marketplaces where insurers could\nsell plans. To encourage insurers to enter those market-\nplaces, the Act created several programs to defray the car-\nriers\u2019 costs and cabin their risks.\n   Among these initiatives was the \u201cRisk Corridors\u201d pro-\ngram, a temporary framework meant to compensate insur-\ners for unexpectedly unprofitable plans during the market-\nplaces\u2019 first three years. The since-expired Risk Corridors\nstatute, \u00a71342, set a formula for calculating payments un-\nder the program: If an insurance plan loses a certain\namount of money, the Federal Government \u201cshall pay\u201d the\nplan; if the plan makes a certain amount of money, the plan\n\u201cshall pay\u201d the Government.

Some plans made money\nand paid the Government. Many suffered losses and sought\nreimbursement. The Government, however, did not pay.\n   These cases are about whether petitioners\u2014insurers who\nclaim losses under the Risk Corridors program\u2014have a\nright to payment under \u00a71342 and a damages remedy for\nthe unpaid amounts. We hold that they do. We conclude\nthat \u00a71342 of the Affordable Care Act established a money-\nmandating obligation, that Congress did not repeal this ob-\nligation, and that petitioners may sue the Government for\ndamages in the Court of Federal Claims.\n                             I\n                             A\n   In 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Af-\nfordable Care Act, 124 Stat. 119, seeking to improve na-\ntional health-insurance markets and extend coverage to\nmillions of people without adequate (or any) health insur-\nance.

Peti-\ntioners\u2019 prayer for relief under the Risk Corridors statute\nlooks nothing like the requested redress in Bowen. Peti-\ntioners do not ask for prospective, nonmonetary relief to\nclarify future obligations; they seek specific sums already\ncalculated, past due, and designed to compensate for com-\npleted labors. The Risk Corridors statute and Tucker Act\nallow them that remedy. And because the Risk Corridors\nprogram expired years ago, this litigation presents no spe-\ncial concern about managing a complex ongoing relation-\n\f30 MAINE COMMUNITY HEALTH OPTIONS v.

And by failing to appropriate enough\nsums for payments already owed, Congress did simply that\nand no more: The appropriation bills neither repealed nor\ndischarged \u00a71342\u2019s unique obligation. Lacking other statu-\ntory paths to relief, and absent a Bowen barrier, petitioners\nmay seek to collect payment through a damages action in\nthe Court of Federal Claims.15\n  These holdings reflect a principle as old as the Nation it-\nself: The Government should honor its obligations. Soon\nafter ratification, Alexander Hamilton stressed this insight\nas a cornerstone of fiscal policy. \u201cStates,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwho\nobserve their engagements . . . are respected and trusted:\nwhile the reverse is the fate of those . . . who pursue an op-\nposite conduct.\u201d Report Relative to a Provision for the Sup-\nport of Public Credit (Jan. 9, 1790), in 6 Papers of Alexander\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 The dissent concedes that there may \u201cbe some sharply defined cate-\n\ngories of claims that may be properly asserted\u201d through the Tucker\nAct \u201csimply as a matter of precedent.\u201d Post, at 6, and nn. 3, 4 (citing\ntakings, breach-of-contract, failure-to-pay-compensation, and breach-of-\nfiduciary-duty claims as examples). Petitioners\u2019 claim\u2014breach of an\nunambiguous statutory promise to pay for services rendered to the\nGovernment\u2014fits easily within those precedents. The only differences\nthe dissent seems to assert here are that the dollar figure is higher and\nthat petitioners do not deserve a \u201cbailout\u201d for their \u201cbet\u201d that the Federal\nGovernment would comply with federal law.

Our analysis in Tucker Act cases\nhas never revolved on such results-oriented reasoning.\n   15 Having found that the Risk Corridors statute is a money-mandating\n\nprovision for which a Tucker Act suit lies, we need not resolve petitioners\u2019\nalternative arguments for recovery based on an implied-in-fact contract\ntheory or under the Takings Clause.\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

Nor does\nany other federal statute expressly create such a right of\naction. The Court, however, holds that \u00a71342 of the Afford-\nable Care Act does so by implication. Because \u00a71342 says\nthat the United States \u201cshall pay\u201d for the companies\u2019 losses,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a718062(b)(1), the Court finds it is proper to infer\na private right of action to recover for these losses.\n  This is an important step.

This money will have to be paid even\nthough Congress has pointedly declined to appropriate\nmoney for that purpose.\n  Not only will today\u2019s decision have a massive immediate\nimpact, its potential consequences go much further.

Petitioners\nclaimed that the rule violated the Second Amendment. Pe-\ntitioners sought declaratory and injunctive relief against\nenforcement of the rule insofar as the rule prevented their\ntransport of firearms to a second home or shooting range\noutside of the city. The District Court and the Court of Ap-\npeals rejected petitioners\u2019 claim. See 883 F. 3d 45 (CA2\n2018). We granted certiorari. 586 U. S. ___ (2019). After\nwe granted certiorari, the State of New York amended its\nfirearm licensing statute, and the City amended the rule so\nthat petitioners may now transport firearms to a second\nhome or shooting range outside of the city, which is the pre-\ncise relief that petitioners requested in the prayer for relief\nin their complaint. App. 48. Petitioners\u2019 claim for declara-\ntory and injunctive relief with respect to the City\u2019s old rule\nis therefore moot. Petitioners now argue, however, that the\nnew rule may still infringe their rights. In particular, peti-\ntioners claim that they may not be allowed to stop for coffee,\n\f2      NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                      Per Curiam\n\ngas, food, or restroom breaks on the way to their second\nhomes or shooting ranges outside of the city. The City re-\nsponds that those routine stops are entirely permissible un-\nder the new rule. We do not here decide that dispute about\nthe new rule; as we stated in Lewis v. Continental Bank\nCorp., 494 U. S. 472, 482\u2013483 (1990):\n       \u201cOur ordinary practice in disposing of a case that has\n    become moot on appeal is to vacate the judgment with\n    directions to dismiss. See, e.g., Deakins v. Monaghan,\n    484 U. S., at 204; United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,\n    340 U. S. 36, 39\u201340 (1950). However, in instances\n    where the mootness is attributable to a change in the\n    legal framework governing the case, and where the\n    plaintiff may have some residual claim under the new\n    framework that was understandably not asserted pre-\n    viously, our practice is to vacate the judgment and re-\n    mand for further proceedings in which the parties may,\n    if necessary, amend their pleadings or develop the rec-\n    ord more fully. See Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist\n    Church of Miami, Inc., 404 U. S. 412, 415 (1972).\u201d\nPetitioners also argue that, even though they have not pre-\nviously asked for damages with respect to the City\u2019s old\nrule, they still could do so in this lawsuit. Petitioners did\nnot seek damages in their complaint; indeed, the possibility\nof a damages claim was not raised until well into the litiga-\ntion in this Court. The City argues that it is too late for\npetitioners to now add a claim for damages. On remand,\nthe Court of Appeals and the District Court may consider\nwhether petitioners may still add a claim for damages in\nthis lawsuit with respect to New York City\u2019s old rule.

Twelve years ago in District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570 (2008), we held that the Sec-\nond Amendment protects the right of ordinary Americans\nto keep and bear arms. Two years later, our decision in\nMcDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742 (2010), established\nthat this right is fully applicable to the States. Since then,\nthe lower courts have decided numerous cases involving\nSecond Amendment challenges to a variety of federal, state,\nand local laws. Most have failed. We have been asked to\nreview many of these decisions, but until this case, we de-\nnied all such requests.\n   On January 22, 2019, we granted review to consider the\nconstitutionality of a New York City ordinance that bur-\ndened the right recognized in Heller. Among other things,\nthe ordinance prohibited law-abiding New Yorkers with a\nlicense to keep a handgun in the home (a \u201cpremises license\u201d)\nfrom taking that weapon to a firing range outside the City.\nInstead, premises licensees wishing to gain or maintain the\nability to use their weapons safely were limited to the seven\n\f2      NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfiring ranges in the City, all but one of which were largely\nrestricted to members and their guests.\n   In the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the City\nvigorously and successfully defended the constitutionality\nof its ordinance, and the law was upheld based on what we\nare told is the framework for reviewing Second Amendment\nclaims that has been uniformly adopted by the Courts of\nAppeals.1 One might have thought that the City, having\nconvinced the lower courts that its law was consistent with\nHeller, would have been willing to defend its victory in this\nCourt. But once we granted certiorari, both the City and\nthe State of New York sprang into action to prevent us from\ndeciding this case. Although the City had previously in-\nsisted that its ordinance served important public safety\npurposes, our grant of review apparently led to an epiphany\nof sorts, and the City quickly changed its ordinance. And\nfor good measure the State enacted a law making the old\nNew York City ordinance illegal.\n   Thereafter, the City and amici supporting its position\nstrove to have this case thrown out without briefing or ar-\ngument. The City moved for dismissal \u201cas soon as is rea-\nsonably practicable\u201d on the ground that it had \u201cno legal rea-\nson to file a brief.\u201d Suggestion of Mootness 1. When we\nrefused to jettison the case at that early stage, the City sub-\nmitted a brief but \u201cstress[ed] that [its] true position [was]\nthat it ha[d] no view at all regarding the constitutional\nquestions presented\u201d and that it was \u201coffer[ing] a defense of\nthe . . . former rul[e] in the spirit of something a Court-\nappointed amicus curiae might do.\u201d Brief for Respondents 2.\n   A prominent brief supporting the City went further. Five\nUnited States Senators, four of whom are members of the\nbar of this Court, filed a brief insisting that the case be dis-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 See Brief for Second Amendment Law Professors et al. as Amici\n\nCuriae 8\u20139.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

If the Court did not do so, they intimated, the pub-\nlic would realize that the Court is \u201cmotivated mainly by pol-\nitics, rather than by adherence to the law,\u201d and the Court\nwould face the possibility of legislative reprisal. Brief for\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse et al. as Amici Curiae 2\u20133, 18 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n   Regrettably, the Court now dismisses the case as moot.\nIf the Court were right on the law, I would of course approve\nthat disposition. Under the Constitution, our authority is\nlimited to deciding actual cases or controversies, and if this\nwere no longer a live controversy\u2014that is, if it were now\nmoot\u2014we would be compelled to dismiss. But if a case is\non our docket and we have jurisdiction, we have an obliga-\ntion to decide it. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the\nCourt in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821), \u201c[w]e\nhave no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction\nwhich is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\u201d\n   Thus, in this case, we must apply the well-established\nstandards for determining whether a case is moot, and un-\nder those standards, we still have a live case before us. It\nis certainly true that the new City ordinance and the new\nState law give petitioners most of what they sought, but\nthat is not the test for mootness. Instead, \u201ca case \u2018becomes\nmoot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any ef-\nfectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d Chafin v.\nChafin, 568 U.

Lunetta justified the law in three ways.\nFirst, he maintained that the restriction on out-of-city\ntransport promoted public safety by causing \u201cpremises li-\ncense holders [to] bring their firearms into the public do-\nmain less frequently.\u201d Id., at 78; see also id., at 77.\n   Second, he claimed that the transport restriction helped\nto prevent the gun violence that might occur if a licensee\nbecame involved in an altercation while on the way to an\nout-of-city range or competition. Lunetta asserted that\nlicensees are \u201cas susceptible as anyone else\u201d to \u201cstress-\ninducing circumstances\u201d that can lead to violence. Ibid.\n   Finally, he claimed that the travel restriction made it\nsimpler for a patrol officer to check whether the holder of a\npremises license who is found in possession of a gun outside\nthe home is really headed for a range or is simply using that\nas a pretext for carrying a gun. Id., at 78\u201379.

If a live controversy ceases to\nexist\u2014i.e., if a case becomes moot\u2014then we have no juris-\ndiction to proceed.

It is entirely possible for them to obtain more relief,\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    13\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand therefore this case is not moot. This is so for the fol-\nlowing reasons.\n                               A\n   First, this case is not moot because the amended City or-\ndinance and new State law do not give petitioners all the\nprospective relief they seek. Petitioners asserted in their\ncomplaint that the Second Amendment guarantees them,\nas holders of premises licenses, \u201cunrestricted access\u201d to\nranges, competitions, and second homes outside of New\nYork City, App. 36, and the new laws do not give them that.4\n   The new City ordinance has limitations that petitioners\nclaim are unconstitutional, namely, that a trip outside the\nCity must be \u201cdirec[t]\u201d and travel within the City must be\n\u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted.\u201d 38 N. Y. C. R. R. \u00a7\u00a75\u2013\n23(a)(3), (a)(7). Exactly what these restrictions mean is not\nclear from the face of the rule, and the City has done little\nto clarify their reach. At argument, counsel told us that the\nnew rule allows \u201cbathroom breaks,\u201d \u201ccoffee stops,\u201d and any\nother \u201creasonably necessary stops in the course of travel.\u201d\nTr. of Oral Arg. 36, 64. But the meaning of a \u201creasonably\nnecessary\u201d stop is hardly clear. What about a stop to buy\ngroceries just before coming home? Or a stop to pick up a\nfriend who also wants to practice at a range outside the\nCity? Or a quick visit to a sick relative or friend who lives\nnear a range? The City does not know the answer to such\nquestions. See, e.g., id., at 65\u201366.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Contrary to the City\u2019s suggestion, see Reply to Suggestion of Moot-\n\nness 5, petitioners have not softened their stance over the course of this\nlitigation. At summary judgment, petitioners asked that the District\nCourt declare 38 N. Y. C. R. R. \u00a75\u201323 unconstitutional and enjoin its en-\nforcement \u201cin any manner that prohibits or precludes [petitioners] from\ntraveling\u201d with their handguns to a range, competition, or second home\noutside the borders of New York City.

The new State law appears to\nprevent the City from penalizing any \u201cdirec[t]\u201d trip to a\nrange or competition outside the City, but the State law\ndoes not define that limitation. The petitioners wanted to\nenter competitions in upstate New York more than a five\nhour drive from the City. Could they stop along the way?\nAnd if so, for how long? The State has not explained its\nunderstanding of this limitation, and in any event, prosecu-\ntorial decisions in New York are generally made by the\nState\u2019s 67 elected district attorneys. See Haggerty v. Hime-\nlein, 221 App. Div. 2d 138, 144\u2013145, 644 N. Y. S. 2d 934,\n940 (1996). The bottom line is that petitioners, who sought\n\u201cunrestricted access\u201d to out-of-city ranges and competitions,\nare still subject to restrictions of undetermined meaning.\n   These restrictions may not seem very important, but that\nis beside the point for purposes of mootness. Nor does it\nmatter whether, in the end, those restrictions would be\nfound to violate the Second Amendment. All that matters\nfor present purposes is that the City still withholds from\npetitioners something that they have claimed from the be-\nginning is their constitutional right. It follows that the case\nis not moot. It is as simple as that.\n   The situation here resembles that in Knox, 567 U. S. 298.\nThe issue in that case was whether a public sector union\nhad provided nonmembers the sort of notice that our case\nlaw required before they could be forced to pay a fee to\nsubsidize certain union activities. We granted certiorari to\nreview the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the notice that the\nunion had provided was sufficient, but before we could de-\ncide the case, the union sent out a new notice and moved to\ndismiss the case as moot. The employees objected that the\nnew notice was inadequate, and we refused to dismiss. In\nso doing, we did not opine on the adequacy of the new notice\nbut simply held that the case was not moot because \u201cthere\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Although the new notice might have given\nthe nonmembers most of what they sought, they still pos-\nsessed \u201c \u2018a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome\nof the litigation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 307\u2013308. And that was enough.\n   The situation here is essentially the same. Petitioners\ngot most, but not all, of the prospective relief they wanted,\nand that means that the case is not dead.\n                               B\n   The case is not moot for a separate and independent rea-\nson: If this Court were to hold, as petitioners request and\nas I believe we should, that 38 N. Y. C. R. R. \u00a75\u201323 violated\npetitioners\u2019 Second Amendment right, the District Court on\nremand could (and probably should) award damages. See\nMission Product Holdings, 587 U. S., at ___. Petitioners\nbrought their claims under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, which per-\nmits the recovery of damages. See Monell v. New York City\nDept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 695\u2013701 (1978). And\nwhile the amended complaint does not expressly seek dam-\nages, it is enough that it requests \u201c[a]ny other such further\nrelief as the [c]ourt deems just and proper.\u201d App. 48. Under\nmodern pleading standards, that suffices.\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a \u201cfinal\njudgment should grant the relief to which each party is en-\ntitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its\npleadings.\u201d Rule 54(c) (emphasis added); see also 10 C.\nWright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure\n\u00a7\u00a72662, 2664 (4th ed. 2014) (Wright & Miller).5 Courts have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Lower courts have affirmed that Fed.

See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S.\n405, 424 (1975); United States v. Marin, 651 F. 2d 24, 30\n(CA1 1981); 10 Wright & Miller \u00a72664. Otherwise, \u201ca party\nshould experience little difficulty in securing a remedy\nother than that demanded in the pleadings as long as the\nparty shows a right to it.\u201d Id., \u00a72662, p. 168. Here, that\ncould include damages.\n                               1\n   At a minimum, if petitioners succeeded on their challenge\nto the travel restrictions, they would be eligible for nominal\ndamages. When a plaintiff \u2019s constitutional rights have\nbeen violated, nominal damages may be awarded without\nproof of any additional injury. See Carey v. Piphus, 435\nU. S. 247 (1978); Memphis Community School Dist. v. Sta-\nchura, 477 U. S. 299 (1986). Nominal damages are \u201cthe ap-\npropriate means of vindicating rights whose deprivation\nhas not caused actual, provable injury.\u201d Id., at 308, n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Carey, 435\nU. S., at 266. And they are particularly important in vindi-\ncating constitutional interests. See Riverside v. Rivera, 477\nU. S. 561, 574 (1986) (plurality opinion). Consequently,\ncourts routinely award nominal damages for constitutional\nviolations. See, e.g., Stoedter v. Gates, 704 Fed. Appx. 748,\n762 (CA10 2017) (Fourth Amendment); Klein v. Laguna\nBeach, 810 F. 3d 693, 697 (CA9 2016) (free speech); Project\nVote/Voting for America, Inc. v. Dickerson, 444 Fed.

To get such relief,\nthey would of course be required to show that they suffered\nan \u201cactual injury.\u201d See Carey, 435 U. S., at 266; D. Dobbs\n& C. Roberts, Law of Remedies \u00a77.4(1), p. 660 (3d ed. 2018).\nBut petitioners may be able to make such a showing. As\ndiscussed above, the failure to include in their complaint\nspecific factual allegations of actual injury would not pre-\nclude such recovery.7 See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(c). Nor\nwere petitioners obligated to provide information support-\ning actual injury in opposing the City\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment.\n  If we were to reverse the judgment below and hold the\nCity\u2019s old rule unconstitutional, it would be appropriate to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 A single Circuit has held that a claim for nominal damages alone does\n\nnot maintain a live dispute. See Flanigan\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. of Ga. v.\nSandy Springs, 868 F. 3d 1248 (CA11 2017). But that holding is difficult\nto reconcile with Carey and Stachura\u2019s endorsement of nominal damages\nas an appropriate constitutional remedy.\n   7 Even if specific allegations in the complaint were necessary, the Dis-\n\ntrict Court could allow amendment. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine\nResearch, Inc., 401 U. S. 321, 331 (1971); 6 Wright & Miller \u00a71474 (3d ed.\n2010).\n\f18     NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nremand the case for proceedings on the question of reme-\ndies.

One or more of the petitioners could seek\ncompensation for out-of-pocket expenses, such as member-\nship fees at in-city ranges. The current record shows that\nat least one of the petitioners is a member of a range in the\nCity. App. 93\u201394. In addition, a petitioner may be entitled\nto compensation for expenses incurred in registering for\nout-of-city competitions from which he was compelled to\nwithdraw. The record shows that one petitioner signed up\nfor such a competition but had to pull out as a result of the\nCity ordinance. Id., at 32, 55. Petitioners could also seek\ncompensation for any intangible but nevertheless real and\npersonal injuries that they suffered due to their inability to\nattend shooting competitions, to practice at out-of-city\nranges, or to take their licensed handguns to second homes.\nNoneconomic damages such as loss of enjoyment are avail-\nable in \u00a71983 litigation.

Lower courts have affirmed awards\nof compensatory damages for similar kinds of injuries re-\nsulting from constitutional violations. See Dobbs, Law of\nRemedies, at 660.8 Petitioners could introduce evidence on\nremand to show such loss.\n  For purposes of determining whether this case is moot,\nthe question is not whether petitioners would actually suc-\nceed in obtaining such damages or whether their loss was\nsubstantial.

That\nharm included the organization\u2019s inability to recruit new members, dis-\nseminate its views, and encourage others to support its positions. 796\nF. 2d, at 1558\u20131559; see also, e.g., King v.

We\nhave warned in dicta that a claim of damages, \u201casserted\nsolely to avoid otherwise certain mootness, [bears] close in-\nspection.\u201d Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520\nU. S. 43, 71 (1997). But if, after close inspection, we con-\nclude that the stringent test for mootness is not met, we\nhave no authority to dismiss on that ground.\n   Nothing in Arizonans for Official English suggests other-\nwise. In that case, the plaintiff, who was an employee of\nthe State of Arizona when she filed her complaint, sued the\nState under \u00a71983, claiming that a state constitutional\namendment declaring English the official language of the\nState unconstitutionally prevented her from using Spanish\nto perform her job. Her requests for declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief became moot when she left state employment for\nthe private sector, and we held that her request for nominal\ndamages from the State did not save her case from moot-\nness since a State may not be sued under \u00a71983. 520 U. S.,\nat 67\u201369, 71. The situation here is different because noth-\ning blocks an award of nominal damages from a city.9\n                                C\n     Relief would be particularly appropriate here because the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The per curiam refuses to decide whether petitioners have a live claim\n\nfor damages, claiming that the lower courts should determine in the first\ninstance whether any effort to recover damages has come \u201ctoo late.\u201d\nAnte, at 2. But as previously discussed, see supra, at 15\u201316, prejudice is\nthe critical factor in determining whether to permit a late request for a\nform of relief not expressly demanded in a complaint, and the per curiam\ndoes not identify any reason why allowing petitioners\u2019 request for dam-\nages at this juncture would prejudice the City. Under the Court\u2019s deci-\nsion, allowing damages will not prolong this litigation, because the case\nis being remanded anyway, and there is no suggestion that the City\nwould have litigated the case any differently if it had been on express\nnotice that petitioners were seeking the sort of modest damages dis-\ncussed in this opinion.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 480\n(1990). But where a live controversy remains, a defendant\nwho would otherwise be liable for attorney\u2019s fees should not\nbe able to wiggle out on the basis of a spurious claim of\nmootness.\n   If a \u00a71983 plaintiff achieves any success on the merits,\neven an award of nominal damages, the plaintiff is a pre-\nvailing party and is eligible for attorney\u2019s fees under 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71988. See Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc.\nv. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532\nU. S. 598, 603 (2001). For this reason, were the Court to\nexercise jurisdiction in this case and rule for petitioners,\nthey would be eligible for attorney\u2019s fees. See Farrar v.\nHobby, 506 U. S. 103, 109 (1992).\n   On the other hand, dismissing the case as moot means\nthat petitioners are stuck with the attorney\u2019s fees they in-\ncurred in challenging a rule that the City ultimately aban-\ndoned\u2014and which it now admits was not needed for public\nsafety. That is so because \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s voluntary change\nin conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plain-\ntiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary\njudicial imprimatur on the change.\u201d Buckhannon, 532\nU.

But once we granted\nreview, the City essentially attempted to impose a unilat-\neral settlement that deprived petitioners of attorney\u2019s fees.\nAnd those fees would likely be substantial. They would re-\nflect five years of intensive litigation\u2014everything from the\ndrafting of the complaint, through multiple rounds of Dis-\ntrict Court motion practice, to appellate review, and pro-\nceedings in this Court.\n                              III\n   The per curiam provides no sound reason for holding that\nthis case is moot. The per curiam states that the City\u2019s cur-\nrent rule gave petitioners \u201cthe precise relief [they] re-\nquested\u201d in their prayer for relief, ante, at 1, but that is not\nso. Petitioners\u2019 prayer for relief asks the court to enjoin 38\nN. Y. C. R.

The new rule\u2019s conditions unmistakably continue to\nprohibit some travel outside the City to those destinations.\nFor this reason, petitioners have not obtained the \u201cunre-\nstricted access\u201d that, they have always maintained, the Sec-\nond Amendment guarantees. Id., at 36. The per curiam\nimplies that the current rule, as interpreted at oral argu-\nment by counsel for the City, gives petitioners everything\nthat they now seek, ante, at 1, but that also is not true.

What petitioners\nclaimed in their complaint and still claim is that they are\nentitled to \u201cunrestricted access\u201d to out-of-city ranges and\ncompetitions. App. 36. The City\u2019s replacement of one law\ndenying unrestricted access with another that also denies\nthat access did not change the nature of petitioners\u2019 claim\nor render it moot.\n   Consider where acceptance of the argument adopted by\nthe per curiam leads. Suppose that a city council, seeking\nto suppress a local paper\u2019s opposition to some of its pro-\ngrams, adopts an ordinance prohibiting the publication of\nany editorial without the approval of a city official. Suppose\nthat a newspaper challenges the constitutionality of this\nrule, arguing that the First Amendment confers the unre-\nstricted right to editorialize without prior approval. If the\ncouncil then repeals its ordinance and replaces it with a\nnew one requiring approval only if the editorial concerns\none particular city program, would that render the pending\nlawsuit moot and require the paper to commence a new one?\n   Or take this example. A State enacts a law providing that\nany woman wishing to obtain an abortion must submit cer-\ntification from five doctors that the procedure is medically\nnecessary. After a woman sues, claiming that any require-\nment of physician certification is unconstitutional, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201creasonably necessary\u201d under the new rule. Tr. of Oral Arg. 64\u201365. But\nwhat that means is far from clear, and, at any rate, coffee breaks and the\nlike are just illustrative examples of potential ways in which the new\nrule affords something less than unfettered access to gun ranges, compe-\ntitions, and second homes outside the City. See supra, at 13.\n\f24     NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nState replaces its old law with a new one requiring certifi-\ncation by three physicians. Would the court be required to\ndismiss the woman\u2019s suit? Suppose the court, following the\nprecedent set by today\u2019s decision, holds that the case is\nmoot, and suppose that the woman brings a second case\nchallenging the new law on the same ground. If the State\nrepeals that law and replaces it with one requiring certifi-\ncation by two doctors, would the second suit be moot? And\nwhat if the State responds to a third suit by enacting\nreplacement legislation demanding certification by one\ndoctor?\n   Mootness doctrine does not require such results. A chal-\nlenge to an allegedly unconstitutional law does not become\nmoot with the enactment of new legislation that reduces but\ndoes not eliminate the injury originally alleged. And that\nis the situation here.\n   The Court cites one case in support of its holding, Lewis\nv. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 482\u2013483 (1990),\nbut that decision is wholly inapposite. The situation in\nLewis was complicated, but the critical point for present\npurposes is that, by the time the case reached this Court,\nthe enactment of new legislation meant that the plaintiff no\nlonger had Article III standing to assert its original claim.\nId., at 478\u2013479. But instead of simply ordering that the\ncase be dismissed, the Court remanded to give the plaintiff\nthe opportunity to assert a different claim and, if necessary,\nto amend the complaint or \u201cdevelop the record\u201d to show it\nhad standing to pursue this new claim. Id., at 482.\n   The situation here is entirely different. It is not disputed\nthat petitioners have standing to contest the City\u2019s re-\nstrictions on trips to out-of-city ranges and competitions,\nand as a result of those restrictions, petitioners have suf-\nfered and will continue to suffer injury that is concrete,\ntraceable to actions taken by the City, and remediable by a\ncourt.

This is not a close question. The\nanswer follows directly from Heller.\n   In Heller, we held that a District of Columbia rule that\neffectively prevented a law-abiding citizen from keeping a\nhandgun in the home for purposes of self-defense consti-\ntuted a core violation of the Second Amendment. 554 U. S.,\nat 635. We based this decision on the scope of the right to\nkeep and bear arms as it was understood at the time of the\nadoption of the Second Amendment. Id., at 577\u2013605, 628\u2013\n629. We recognized that history supported the constitution-\nality of some laws limiting the right to possess a firearm,\nsuch as laws banning firearms from certain sensitive loca-\ntions and prohibiting possession by felons and other dan-\ngerous individuals. See id., at 626\u2013627; see also McDonald,\n561 U. S., at 787, 904. But history provided no support for\nlaws like the District\u2019s. See 554 U. S., at 629\u2013634.\n   For a similar reason, 38 N. Y. C. R. R. \u00a75\u201323 also violated\nthe Second Amendment. We deal here with the same core\nSecond Amendment right, the right to keep a handgun in\nthe home for self-defense. As the Second Circuit \u201cas-\nsume[d],\u201d a necessary concomitant of this right is the right\nto take a gun outside the home for certain purposes. 883\nF. 3d, at 58\u201359. One of these is to take a gun for mainte-\nnance or repair, which City law allows. See \u00a75\u201322(a)(16).\n\f26     NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nAnother is to take a gun outside the home in order to trans-\nfer ownership lawfully, which the City also allows. \u00a75\u201326(j).\nAnd still another is to take a gun to a range in order to gain\nand maintain the skill necessary to use it responsibly. As\nwe said in Heller, \u201c \u2018to bear arms implies something more\nthan the mere keeping [of arms]; it implies the learning to\nhandle and use them in a way that makes those who keep\nthem ready for their efficient use.\u2019 \u201d 554 U. S., at 617\u2013618\n(quoting T. Cooley, Constitutional Law 271 (1880)); see also\nLuis v. United States, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3) (\u201cThe right to keep\nand bear arms . . . \u2018implies a corresponding right . . . to ac-\nquire and maintain proficiency in their use\u2019 \u201d); Ezell v.

But the same model gun that the person owns may\nnot be available at a range, and in any event each individ-\nual gun may have its own characteristics. See Brief for Pro-\nfessors of Second Amendment Law et al. as Amici Curiae\n10\u201312; see also App. 51, 56, 59 (referencing differences\nacross ranges and shooting competitions). Once it is recog-\nnized that the right at issue is a concomitant of the same\nright recognized in Heller, it became incumbent on the City\nto justify the restrictions its rule imposes, but the City has\nnot done so. It points to no evidence of laws in force around\nthe time of the adoption of the Second Amendment that pre-\nvented gun owners from practicing outside city limits. The\nCity argues that municipalities restricted the places within\ntheir jurisdiction where a gun could be fired, Brief for Re-\nspondents 18, and it observes that the Second Amendment\nsurely does not mean that a New York City resident with a\npremises license can practice in Central Park or Times\nSquare, id., at 21. That is certainly true, but that is not the\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           27\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nquestion. Petitioners do not claim the right to fire weapons\nin public places within the City. Instead, they claim they\nhave a right to practice at ranges and competitions outside\nthe City, and neither the City, the courts below, nor any of\nthe many amici supporting the City have shown that mu-\nnicipalities during the founding era prevented gun owners\nfrom taking their guns outside city limits for practice.\n                                B\n  If history is not sufficient to show that the New York City\nordinance is unconstitutional, any doubt is dispelled by the\nweakness of the City\u2019s showing that its travel restriction\nsignificantly promoted public safety. Although the courts\nbelow claimed to apply heightened scrutiny, there was\nnothing heightened about what they did.\n  As noted, the City relied entirely on the declaration of In-\nspector Lunetta, but this declaration provides little sup-\nport. See supra, at 9\u201310. Some of what Inspector Lunetta\nasserted was simply not relevant to the justification for\ndrawing a distinction between trips to a range in the City\nand trips to a range in a neighboring jurisdiction. For ex-\nample, he stated that persons holding premises licenses \u201cdo\nnot always transport their firearms in a locked box carrying\nammunition separately, as required by NYPD rules,\u201d but\nthe issue in this case does not concern the storage of a gun\non the way to a range. App. 77\u201378. Similarly, he declared\nthat \u201c[p]remises license holders have not demonstrated\nproper cause to carry a concealed firearm in public,\u201d id., at\n78, but the question before us is not whether petitioners\nhave the right to do what they could if they had carry li-\ncenses.\n  Other statements actually undermine the City\u2019s public\nsafety rationale. Thus, the fact that prosecutors typically\ndo not bring even misdemeanor charges against licensees\nwho carry a weapon in violation of the limitations of their\n\f28     NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlicenses, ibid., does not suggest that the City regards viola-\ntions as presenting a particularly significant threat to pub-\nlic safety.\n   When all that is irrelevant is brushed aside, what re-\nmains are the three arguments noted earlier. First, Inspector\nLunetta asserted that the travel restrictions discouraged li-\ncensees from taking their guns outside the home, but this\nis a strange argument for several reasons. It would make\nsense only if it is less convenient or more expensive to prac-\ntice at a range in the City, but that contradicts the City\u2019s\nargument that the seven ranges in the City provide ample\nopportunity for practice. And discouraging trips to a range\ncontradicts the City\u2019s own rule recommending that licen-\nsees practice. Once it is recognized that a reasonable op-\nportunity to practice is part of the very right recognized in\nHeller, what this justification amounts to is a repudiation\nof part of what we held in that decision.\n   Second, Inspector Lunetta claimed that prohibiting trips\nto out-of-city ranges helps prevent a person who is taking a\ngun to a range from using it in a fit of rage after an auto\naccident or some other altercation that occurs along the\nway. And to bolster this argument, Inspector Lunetta as-\nserted that persons who have met the City\u2019s demanding re-\nquirements for obtaining a premises license are just as\nlikely as anyone else to use their guns in a fit of rage. App.\n77. If that is so, it does not reflect well on the City\u2019s inten-\nsive vetting scheme, see supra, at 4\u20136, and in any event, the\nassertion is dubious on its face.\n   More to the point, this argument does not explain why a\nperson headed for a range outside the City is any more\nlikely to engage in such conduct than a person whose desti-\nnation is a range in the City. There might be something to\nthe argument if ranges in the City were closer than those\njust outside its borders, but the City never attempted to\nshow that. The courts below were incurious about the va-\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    29\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlidity of Inspector Lunetta\u2019s assertion, and given the loca-\ntion of the City\u2019s seven ranges, the assertion is more than\ndubious.12\n   Inspector Lunetta\u2019s final justification for the travel re-\nstrictions was only marginally stronger. It goes like this.\nSuppose that a patrol officer stops a premises licensee and\nfinds that this individual is carrying a gun, and suppose\nthat that the licensee says he is taking the gun to a range\nto practice or is returning from a range. If the range in\nquestion is one in the City, the officer will be better able to\ncheck the story than if the range is outside the officer\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction. App. 79\u201380.\n   How strong is this argument? The City presumably has\naccess to records of cases in which licensees were cited for\nunauthorized possession of guns outside the home, and it\nfailed to provide any evidence that holders of target licenses\nhad used their right to practice at out-of-city ranges as a\npretext. And it is dubious that it would be much harder for\nan officer to check whether a licensee was really headed for\nan out-of-city range as opposed to one in the City. If a li-\ncensee claims to be headed for a range in the City, the of-\nficer can check whether the range is open and whether the\nindividual appears to be on a route that plausibly leads to\nthat range. But how much more difficult would it be to do\nthe same thing if the range is in one of the counties that\nborder New York City or across the Hudson River in New\nJersey? A phone call would be enough to determine the\nrange\u2019s operating hours, and the route would still be easy\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Two of the seven City ranges (28%) were located in Staten Island\n\n(home to under 6% of the City\u2019s residents), and the trip there from the\nother boroughs is not quick. Another range (the only one open to the\npublic) was located in the north Bronx. See Brief for Appellants in No.\n15\u2013638, p. 32 (CA2) (explaining that, for plaintiff Colantone, \u201ctraveling\nfrom his home in Staten Island to the authorized range Olinville Arms\nin the Bronx[ involves] a far longer drive\u201d than to a shooting club in New\nJersey).\n\f30      NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                   CITY OF NEW YORK\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto determine: There are only a few bridges and tunnels to\nNew Jersey and just a few main thoroughfares to the neigh-\nboring New York counties. A court conducting any form of\nserious scrutiny would have demanded that the City pro-\nvide some substantiation for this claim, but nothing like\nthat was provided or demanded.\n   Would the situation be much different if the individual\nclaimed to be headed home from a range? Once again, it\nwould not be difficult for the officer to check whether the\nrange was or recently had been open. And it is not at all\napparent that determining whether a licensee was on a\nroute to his or her residence would be any harder if the\nrange at which the licensee claimed to have practiced was\noutside the City.\n   Inspector Lunetta\u2019s declaration stated that ranges in the\nCity are required to keep a record of everyone who practices\nthere, and therefore if a person claims to be coming from a\ncity range, the officer could easily check that story. But the\ndeclaration does not state that ranges in nearby jurisdic-\ntions do not keep similar records.13 It should have been\neasy enough for the City to check, and a court engaged in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Inspector Lunetta also expressed concern that officers in other juris-\n\ndictions might detect and report fewer license violations.

Twelve years ago in District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145777\"><a href=\"/opinion/145777/district-of-columbia-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(2008), we held that the Sec-\nond Amendment protects the right of ordinary Americans\nto keep and bear arms.

Since then,\nthe lower courts have decided numerous cases involving\nSecond Amendment challenges to a variety of federal, state,\nand local laws. Most have failed. We have been asked to\nreview many of these decisions, but until this case, we de-\nnied all such requests.\n   On January 22, 2019, we granted review to consider the\nconstitutionality of a New York City ordinance that bur-\ndened the right recognized in Heller. Among other things,\nthe ordinance prohibited law-abiding New Yorkers with a\nlicense to keep a handgun in the home (a \u201cpremises license\u201d)\nfrom taking that weapon to a firing range outside the City.\nInstead, premises licensees wishing to gain or maintain the\nability to use their weapons safely were limited to the seven\n\f2      NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfiring ranges in the City, all but one of which were largely\nrestricted to members and their guests.\n   In the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the City\nvigorously and successfully defended the constitutionality\nof its ordinance, and the law was upheld based on what we\nare told is the framework for reviewing Second Amendment\nclaims that has been uniformly adopted by the Courts of\nAppeals.1 One might have thought that the City, having\nconvinced the lower courts that its law was consistent with\nHeller, would have been willing to defend its victory in this\nCourt. But once we granted certiorari, both the City and\nthe State of New York sprang into action to prevent us from\ndeciding this case. Although the City had previously in-\nsisted that its ordinance served important public safety\npurposes, our grant of review apparently led to an epiphany\nof sorts, and the City quickly changed its ordinance. And\nfor good measure the State enacted a law making the old\nNew York City ordinance illegal.\n   Thereafter, the City and amici supporting its position\nstrove to have this case thrown out without briefing or ar-\ngument. The City moved for dismissal \u201cas soon as is rea-\nsonably practicable\u201d on the ground that it had \u201cno legal rea-\nson to file a brief.\u201d Suggestion of Mootness 1.

Under the Constitution, our authority is\nlimited to deciding actual cases or controversies, and if this\nwere no longer a live controversy\u2014that is, if it were now\nmoot\u2014we would be compelled to dismiss.

But the meaning of a \u201creasonably\nnecessary\u201d stop is hardly clear. What about a stop to buy\ngroceries just before coming home? Or a stop to pick up a\nfriend who also wants to practice at a range outside the\nCity? Or a quick visit to a sick relative or friend who lives\nnear a range?

The petitioners wanted to\nenter competitions in upstate New York more than a five\nhour drive from the City. Could they stop along the way?\nAnd if so, for how long? The State has not explained its\nunderstanding of this limitation, and in any event, prosecu-\ntorial decisions in New York are generally made by the\nState\u2019s 67 elected district attorneys.

Hime-\nlein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2592113\"><a href=\"/opinion/2592113/marraccini-v-bertelsmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">138, 144\u2013145, 644 N.

The bottom line is that petitioners, who sought\n\u201cunrestricted access\u201d to out-of-city ranges and competitions,\nare still subject to restrictions of undetermined meaning.\n   These restrictions may not seem very important, but that\nis beside the point for purposes of mootness. Nor does it\nmatter whether, in the end, those restrictions would be\nfound to violate the Second Amendment. All that matters\nfor present purposes is that the City still withholds from\npetitioners something that they have claimed from the be-\nginning is their constitutional right. It follows that the case\nis not moot. It is as simple as that.\n   The situation here resembles that in Knox, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nThe issue in that case was whether a public sector union\nhad provided nonmembers the sort of notice that our case\nlaw required before they could be forced to pay a fee to\nsubsidize certain union activities. We granted certiorari to\nreview the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the notice that the\nunion had provided was sufficient, but before we could de-\ncide the case, the union sent out a new notice and moved to\ndismiss the case as moot. The employees objected that the\nnew notice was inadequate, and we refused to dismiss. In\nso doing, we did not opine on the adequacy of the new notice\nbut simply held that the case was not moot because \u201cthere\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

What petitioners\nclaimed in their complaint and still claim is that they are\nentitled to \u201cunrestricted access\u201d to out-of-city ranges and\ncompetitions. App. 36. The City\u2019s replacement of one law\ndenying unrestricted access with another that also denies\nthat access did not change the nature of petitioners\u2019 claim\nor render it moot.\n   Consider where acceptance of the argument adopted by\nthe per curiam leads. Suppose that a city council, seeking\nto suppress a local paper\u2019s opposition to some of its pro-\ngrams, adopts an ordinance prohibiting the publication of\nany editorial without the approval of a city official. Suppose\nthat a newspaper challenges the constitutionality of this\nrule, arguing that the First Amendment confers the unre-\nstricted right to editorialize without prior approval. If the\ncouncil then repeals its ordinance and replaces it with a\nnew one requiring approval only if the editorial concerns\none particular city program, would that render the pending\nlawsuit moot and require the paper to commence a new one?\n   Or take this example. A State enacts a law providing that\nany woman wishing to obtain an abortion must submit cer-\ntification from five doctors that the procedure is medically\nnecessary. After a woman sues, claiming that any require-\nment of physician certification is unconstitutional, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201creasonably necessary\u201d under the new rule.

But\nwhat that means is far from clear, and, at any rate, coffee breaks and the\nlike are just illustrative examples of potential ways in which the new\nrule affords something less than unfettered access to gun ranges, compe-\ntitions, and second homes outside the City. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\f24     NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nState replaces its old law with a new one requiring certifi-\ncation by three physicians.

The\nCity argues that municipalities restricted the places within\ntheir jurisdiction where a gun could be fired, Brief for Re-\nspondents 18, and it observes that the Second Amendment\nsurely does not mean that a New York City resident with a\npremises license can practice in Central Park or Times\nSquare,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> at 21. </span><pre class=\"inline\">That is certainly true, but that is not the\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Instead, they claim they\nhave a right to practice at ranges and competitions outside\nthe City, and neither the City, the courts below, nor any of\nthe many amici supporting the City have shown that mu-\nnicipalities during the founding era prevented gun owners\nfrom taking their guns outside city limits for practice.\n                                B\n  If history is not sufficient to show that the New York City\nordinance is unconstitutional, any doubt is dispelled by the\nweakness of the City\u2019s showing that its travel restriction\nsignificantly promoted public safety. Although the courts\nbelow claimed to apply heightened scrutiny, there was\nnothing heightened about what they did.\n  As noted, the City relied entirely on the declaration of In-\nspector Lunetta, but this declaration provides little sup-\nport. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">9</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201310. Some of what Inspector Lunetta\nasserted was simply not relevant to the justification for\ndrawing a distinction between trips to a range in the City\nand trips to a range in a neighboring jurisdiction. For ex-\nample, he stated that persons holding premises licenses \u201cdo\nnot always transport their firearms in a locked box carrying\nammunition separately, as required by NYPD rules,\u201d but\nthe issue in this case does not concern the storage of a gun\non the way to a range.

Thus, the fact that prosecutors typically\ndo not bring even misdemeanor charges against licensees\nwho carry a weapon in violation of the limitations of their\n\f28     NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                  CITY OF NEW YORK\n                   ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlicenses, ibid., does not suggest that the City regards viola-\ntions as presenting a particularly significant threat to pub-\nlic safety.\n   When all that is irrelevant is brushed aside, what re-\nmains are the three arguments noted earlier. First, Inspector\nLunetta asserted that the travel restrictions discouraged li-\ncensees from taking their guns outside the home, but this\nis a strange argument for several reasons. It would make\nsense only if it is less convenient or more expensive to prac-\ntice at a range in the City, but that contradicts the City\u2019s\nargument that the seven ranges in the City provide ample\nopportunity for practice. And discouraging trips to a range\ncontradicts the City\u2019s own rule recommending that licen-\nsees practice. Once it is recognized that a reasonable op-\nportunity to practice is part of the very right recognized in\nHeller, what this justification amounts to is a repudiation\nof part of what we held in that decision.\n   Second, Inspector Lunetta claimed that prohibiting trips\nto out-of-city ranges helps prevent a person who is taking a\ngun to a range from using it in a fit of rage after an auto\naccident or some other altercation that occurs along the\nway. And to bolster this argument, Inspector Lunetta as-\nserted that persons who have met the City\u2019s demanding re-\nquirements for obtaining a premises license are just as\nlikely as anyone else to use their guns in a fit of rage. App.\n77. If that is so, it does not reflect well on the City\u2019s inten-\nsive vetting scheme, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">4</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\u20136, and in any event, the\nassertion is dubious on its face.\n   More to the point, this argument does not explain why a\nperson headed for a range outside the City is any more\nlikely to engage in such conduct than a person whose desti-\nnation is a range in the City. There might be something to\nthe argument if ranges in the City were closer than those\njust outside its borders, but the City never attempted to\nshow that. The courts below were incurious about the va-\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    29\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlidity of Inspector Lunetta\u2019s assertion, and given the loca-\ntion of the City\u2019s seven ranges, the assertion is more than\ndubious.12\n   Inspector Lunetta\u2019s final justification for the travel re-\nstrictions was only marginally stronger. It goes like this.\nSuppose that a patrol officer stops a premises licensee and\nfinds that this individual is carrying a gun, and suppose\nthat that the licensee says he is taking the gun to a range\nto practice or is returning from a range. If the range in\nquestion is one in the City, the officer will be better able to\ncheck the story than if the range is outside the officer\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction. App. 79\u201380.\n   How strong is this argument? The City presumably has\naccess to records of cases in which licensees were cited for\nunauthorized possession of guns outside the home, and it\nfailed to provide any evidence that holders of target licenses\nhad used their right to practice at out-of-city ranges as a\npretext. And it is dubious that it would be much harder for\nan officer to check whether a licensee was really headed for\nan out-of-city range as opposed to one in the City. If a li-\ncensee claims to be headed for a range in the City, the of-\nficer can check whether the range is open and whether the\nindividual appears to be on a route that plausibly leads to\nthat range. But how much more difficult would it be to do\nthe same thing if the range is in one of the counties that\nborder New York City or across the Hudson River in New\nJersey? A phone call would be enough to determine the\nrange\u2019s operating hours, and the route would still be easy\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Two of the seven City ranges (28%) were located in Staten Island\n\n(home to under 6% of the City\u2019s residents), and the trip there from the\nother boroughs is not quick. Another range (the only one open to the\npublic) was located in the north Bronx. See Brief for Appellants in No.\n15\u2013638, p. 32 (CA2) (explaining that, for plaintiff Colantone, \u201ctraveling\nfrom his home in Staten Island to the authorized range Olinville Arms\nin the Bronx[ involves] a far longer drive\u201d than to a shooting club in New\nJersey).\n\f30      NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSN., INC. v.\n                   CITY OF NEW YORK\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto determine: There are only a few bridges and tunnels to\nNew Jersey and just a few main thoroughfares to the neigh-\nboring New York counties. A court conducting any form of\nserious scrutiny would have demanded that the City pro-\nvide some substantiation for this claim, but nothing like\nthat was provided or demanded.\n   Would the situation be much different if the individual\nclaimed to be headed home from a range? Once again, it\nwould not be difficult for the officer to check whether the\nrange was or recently had been open. And it is not at all\napparent that determining whether a licensee was on a\nroute to his or her residence would be any harder if the\nrange at which the licensee claimed to have practiced was\noutside the City.\n   Inspector Lunetta\u2019s declaration stated that ranges in the\nCity are required to keep a record of everyone who practices\nthere, and therefore if a person claims to be coming from a\ncity range, the officer could easily check that story. But the\ndeclaration does not state that ranges in nearby jurisdic-\ntions do not keep similar records.13 It should have been\neasy enough for the City to check, and a court engaged in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Inspector Lunetta also expressed concern that officers in other juris-\n\ndictions might detect and report fewer license violations. App. 80. But\nInspector Lunetta did not support this prediction, and his declaration\ngives reason to doubt whether a decrease in referrals will actually occur.\nLunetta explains that the NYPD License Division already receives \u201cre-\nports from [the New York State Division of Criminal Justice System] re-\ngarding all arrests made within the State of New York for which an ar-\nrestee is fingerprinted.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> at 86. </span><pre class=\"inline\">But \u201c[n]o formal report is forwarded\nto the License Division for summonses and other arrests and incidents\nfor which a detainee is not fingerprinted.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span> \u201c[T]he License Division\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">may be, but is not always, notified of an arrest\u201d made by the Federal\nGovernment or authorities in another State.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span> By Lunetta\u2019s own\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">account, the NYPD already appears reliant on the State fingerprinting\ndatabase to detect violations in other jurisdictions.

History provides no support for\na restriction of this type. The City\u2019s public safety argu-\nments were weak on their face, were not substantiated in\nany way, and were accepted below with no serious probing.\nAnd once we granted review in this case, the City\u2019s public\nsafety concerns evaporated.\n  We are told that the mode of review in this case is repre-\nsentative of the way Heller has been treated in the lower\ncourts.

Argued November 4, 2019\u2014Decided April 23, 2020\nWhen a lawful permanent resident commits certain serious crimes, the\n Government may initiate removal proceedings before an immigration\n judge. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a. If the lawful permanent resident is found\n removable, the immigration judge may cancel removal, but only if the\n lawful permanent resident meets strict statutory eligibility require-\n ments. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), 1229b(d)(1)(B).\n    Over the span of 12 years, lawful permanent resident Andre Barton\n was convicted of state crimes, including a firearms offense, drug of-\n fenses, and aggravated assault offenses. An Immigration Judge found\n him removable based on his state firearms and drug offenses. Barton\n applied for cancellation of removal. Among the eligibility require-\n ments, a lawful permanent resident must have \u201cresided in the United\n States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any sta-\n tus.\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(2). Another provision, the so-called stop-time rule,\n provides that a continuous period of residence \u201cshall be deemed to end\u201d\n when the lawful permanent resident commits \u201can offense referred to\n in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible to the\n United States under section 1182(a)(2).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). Because\n Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were committed within his first\n seven years of admission and were covered by \u00a71182(a)(2), the Immi-\n gration Judge concluded that Barton was not eligible for cancellation\n of removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals and the Eleventh Cir-\n cuit agreed.\nHeld: For purposes of cancellation-of-removal eligibility, a \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\n fense committed during the initial seven years of residence does not\n need to be one of the offenses of removal. Pp. 6\u201317.\n    (a) The cancellation-of-removal statute functions like a traditional\n\f2                            BARTON v. BARR\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    recidivist sentencing statute, making a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes rele-\n    vant to eligibility for cancellation of removal. The statute\u2019s text clari-\n    fies two points relevant here. First, cancellation of removal is pre-\n    cluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the noncitizen\n    \u201ccommitted an offense referred to in section 1182(a)(2),\u201d even if (as in\n    Barton\u2019s case) the conviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\n    Second, the offense must \u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible\u201d as a result.\n    For crimes involving moral turpitude, the relevant category here,\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) provides that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when\n    he is convicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n       As a matter of statutory text and structure, the analysis here is\n    straightforward. Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were crimes in-\n    volving moral turpitude and therefore \u201creferred to in section\n    1182(a)(2).\u201d He committed the offenses during his initial seven years\n    of residence and was later convicted of the offenses, thereby rendering\n    him \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Barton was, therefore, ineligible for cancellation\n    of removal. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Barton\u2019s counterarguments are unpersuasive. First, he claims\n    that the statute\u2019s structure supports an \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach.\n    But \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014are ordinarily the\n    basis for removal of lawful permanent residents. Therefore, Barton\u2019s\n    structural argument falls apart. If he were correct, the statute pre-\n    sumably would specify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or sec-\n    tion 1227(a)(2).\u201d By contrast, some other immigration law provisions\n    do focus only on the offense of removal, and their statutory text and\n    context support that limitation.          See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71226(a), (c)(1)(A),\n    1252(a)(2)(C).\n       Second, seizing on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an offense re-\n    ferred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible\n    to the United States under section 1182(a)(2),\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B), Barton\n    argues that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when actually ad-\n    judicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the United States,\n    something that usually cannot happen to a lawfully admitted nonciti-\n    zen. But the statutory text employs the term \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a\n    status that can result from, e.g., a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully\n    admitted noncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n    \u00a71182(a)(2). See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (B). And Congress has made\n    that status relevant in several statutory contexts that apply to law-\n    fully admitted noncitizens such as Barton. In those contexts, a noncit-\n    izen faces immigration consequences from being convicted of a\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even though the noncitizen is lawfully admitted\n    and is not necessarily removable solely because of that offense. See,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii). Such examples pose a major hurdle\n    for Barton\u2019s textual argument, and Barton has no persuasive answer.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     Third, Barton argues that the Government\u2019s interpretation treats as\n  surplusage the phrase \u201cor removable from the United States under\n  section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4).\u201d But redundancies are common in\n  statutory drafting. The Court has often recognized that sometimes the\n  better overall reading of a statute contains some redundancy. And re-\n  dundancy in one portion of a statute is not a license to rewrite or evis-\n  cerate another portion of the statute contrary to its text.\n     Finally, Barton argues alternatively that, even if inadmissibility is\n  a status, and even if the offense that precludes cancellation of removal\n  need not be one of the offenses of removal, a noncitizen must at least\n  have been capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmissibility\n  offense as the basis for removal. Because the cancellation-of-removal\n  statute is a recidivist statute, however, whether the offense that pre-\n  cludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have been charged\n  as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant.

But unlike a U. S. citizen, a lawful permanent\nresident who commits a serious crime may be removed from\nthe United States.\n   Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a longtime law-\nful permanent resident of the United States. During his\ntime in the United States, Barton has been convicted of\nstate crimes on three separate occasions spanning 12 years.\nThe crimes include a firearms offense, drug offenses, and\naggravated assault offenses. By law, the firearms offense\nand the drug offenses each independently rendered Barton\neligible for removal from the United States. In September\n2016, the U. S. Government sought to remove Barton,\nand a U. S. Immigration Judge determined that Barton was\nremovable.\n   Barton applied for cancellation of removal, a form of relief\nthat allows a noncitizen to remain in the United States de-\n\f2                         BARTON v. BARR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nspite being found removable. The immigration laws author-\nize an immigration judge to cancel removal, but Congress\nhas established strict eligibility requirements. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), (d)(1)(B). For a lawful permanent res-\nident such as Barton, the applicant for cancellation of re-\nmoval (1) must have been a lawful permanent resident for\nat least five years; (2) must have continuously resided in\nthe United States for at least seven years after lawful ad-\nmission; (3) must not have been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony as defined in the immigration laws; and (4) during\nthe initial seven years of continuous residence, must not\nhave committed certain other offenses listed in 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71182(a)(2). If a lawful permanent resident meets those el-\nigibility requirements, the immigration judge has discre-\ntion to (but is not required to) cancel removal and allow the\nlawful permanent resident to remain in the United States.\n   Under the cancellation-of-removal statute, the immigra-\ntion judge examines the applicant\u2019s prior crimes, as well as\nthe offense that triggered his removal. If a lawful perma-\nnent resident has ever been convicted of an aggravated fel-\nony, or has committed an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) dur-\ning the initial seven years of residence, that criminal record\nwill preclude cancellation of removal.1 In that way, the\nstatute operates like traditional criminal recidivist laws,\nwhich ordinarily authorize or impose greater sanctions on\noffenders who have committed prior crimes.\n   In this case, after finding Barton removable based on his\nstate firearms and drug offenses, the Immigration Judge\nand the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) concluded that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As the statute makes clear, and as we discuss below, committing a\n\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense precludes cancellation of removal only if the offense\nalso \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen inadmissible. See infra, at 10. Section\n1182(a)(2) specifies what that means for each of its enumerated offenses.\nFor the offense at issue in this case, the noncitizen must also have been\nconvicted of or admitted the offense.\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

Barton\nhad committed offenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during his ini-\ntial seven years of residence\u2014namely, his state aggravated\nassault offenses in 1996. Barton\u2019s 1996 aggravated assault\noffenses were not the offenses that triggered his removal.\nBut according to the BIA, and contrary to Barton\u2019s argu-\nment, the offense that precludes cancellation of removal\nneed not be one of the offenses of removal. In re Jurado-\nDelgado, 24 I. & N. Dec. 29, 31 (BIA 2006). The U. S. Court\nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the BIA\u2019s\nreading of the statute and concluded that Barton was not\neligible for cancellation of removal. The Second, Third, and\nFifth Circuits have similarly construed the statute; only the\nNinth Circuit has disagreed.\n   Barton argues that the BIA and the Eleventh Circuit mis-\ninterpreted the statute. He contends that the \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffense that precludes cancellation of removal must be one\nof the offenses of removal. We disagree with Barton, and\nwe affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.\n                             I\n  Federal immigration law governs the admission of\nnoncitizens to the United States and the deportation of\nnoncitizens previously admitted. See 8 U. S.

But the comprehensive immi-\ngration law that Congress passed and President Clinton\nsigned in 1996 tightly cabins eligibility for cancellation of\nremoval.

C.\n\u00a71101 note.\n   For a lawful permanent resident, the cancellation-of-\nremoval statute provides that an immigration judge \u201cmay\ncancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible\nor deportable from the United States if the alien\u2014(1) has\nbeen an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for\nnot less than 5 years, (2) has resided in the United States\ncontinuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any\nstatus, and (3) has not been convicted of any aggravated fel-\nony.\u201d \u00a71229b(a).3\n   The statute imposes one other requirement known as the\n\u201cstop-time rule.\u201d As relevant here, the statute provides that\na lawful permanent resident, during the initial seven years\nof residence, also cannot have committed \u201can offense re-\nferred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2) of this title or removable from the United States\nunder section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(d)(1)(B).\n   Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a lawful per-\nmanent resident of the United States. In 1996, he was con-\nvicted in a Georgia court of a firearms offense stemming\nfrom an incident where Barton and a friend shot up the\nhouse of Barton\u2019s ex-girlfriend. In separate proceedings in\n2007 and 2008, he was convicted in Georgia courts of state\ndrug offenses. One case involved methamphetamine, and\nthe other involved cocaine and marijuana.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The immigration laws impose a similar but even stricter set of eligi-\n\nbility requirements for noncitizens who are not lawful permanent resi-\ndents. \u00a71229b(b).\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

C. \u00a71227(a)(2) based on the 1996\nfirearms offense and the 2007 and 2008 drug crimes. See\n\u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i), (C). Barton conceded that he was remov-\nable based on his criminal co nvictions for the firearms of-\nfense and drug offenses, and an Immigration Judge found\nhim removable.\n   Barton applied for cancellation of removal. All agree that\nBarton meets two of the eligibility requirements for cancel-\nlation of removal. He has been a lawful permanent resident\nfor more than five years. And he has not been convicted of\nan \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined by the immigration laws.\n   The Immigration Judge concluded, however, that Barton\nhad committed an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during his\ninitial seven years of residence. In 1996, 61\u20442 years after his\nadmission to this country, Barton committed aggravated\nassault offenses for which he was later convicted in a Geor-\ngia court. The Immigration Judge concluded that those ag-\ngravated assault offenses were covered by \u00a71182(a)(2) and\nthat Barton was therefore not eligible for cancellation of\nremoval.\n   The Board of Immigration Appeals and the U. S. Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit likewise concluded that\nBarton was not eligible for cancellation of removal. Barton\nv. United States Atty. Gen., 904 F. 3d 1294, 1302 (2018).\nThe key question was whether the offense that precludes\ncancellation of removal (here, Barton\u2019s 1996 aggravated\nassault offenses) must also be one of the offenses of\nremoval.4 The Board of Immigration Appeals has long\ninterpreted the statute to mean that \u201can alien need not\nactually be charged and found inadmissible or removable\non the applicable ground in order for the criminal conduct\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The term \u201coffense of removal\u201d describes the offense that was the\n\nground on which the immigration judge, at the removal proceeding,\nfound the noncitizen removable.\n\f6                     BARTON v.

Dec., at 31. In this case, the Eleventh\nCircuit likewise indicated that the \u00a71182(a)(2) offense that\nprecludes cancellation of removal need not be one of the\noffenses of removal. 904 F. 3d, at 1299\u20131300. And the\nSecond, Third, and Fifth Circuits have similarly construed\nthe statute. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 F. 3d 60, 68 (CA2\n2017); Ardon v. Attorney General of United States, 449 Fed.\nAppx. 116, 118 (CA3 2011); Calix v. Lynch, 784 F. 3d 1000,\n1011 (CA5 2015).\n   But in 2018, the Ninth Circuit disagreed with those\ncourts and with the BIA. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a\nlawful permanent resident\u2019s commission of an offense listed\nin \u00a71182(a)(2) makes the noncitizen ineligible for\ncancellation of removal only if that offense was one of the\noffenses of removal. Nguyen v. Sessions, 901 F. 3d 1093,\n1097 (2018). Under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach, Barton\nwould have been eligible for cancellation of removal because\nhis \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses (his 1996 aggravated assault\noffenses) were not among the offenses of removal (his 1996\nfirearms offense and his 2007 and 2008 drug crimes).\n   In light of the division in the Courts of Appeals over how\nto interpret this statute, we granted certiorari. 587 U.

But the\nimmigration laws impose strict eligibility requirements for\ncancellation of removal. To reiterate, a lawful permanent\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U.

The statutory list of aggravated felo-\nnies is long: murder, rape, drug trafficking, firearms traf-\nficking, obstruction of justice, treason, gambling, human\ntrafficking, and tax evasion, among many other crimes.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(A)\u2013(U).\n   In addition, the law precludes cancellation of removal if\nthe lawful permanent resident committed certain other se-\nrious crimes during the initial seven years of residence. The\nlaw defines those offenses by cross-referencing \u00a71182(a)(2),\nwhich specifies the offenses that can render a noncitizen\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d to the United States. Section 1182(a)(2) in-\ncludes \u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude,\u201d which is a gen-\neral category that covers a wide variety of crimes. Section\n1182(a)(2) also expressly encompasses various violations of\ndrug laws, prostitution, money laundering, and certain\nDUIs involving personal injury, among other crimes.\n\f8                         BARTON v. BARR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (C), (D), (E), (I); see \u00a71101(h).\n   In specifying when cancellation of removal would be pre-\ncluded because of prior criminal activity, Congress struck a\nbalance that considers both the nature of the prior crime\nand the length of time that the noncitizen has resided in the\nUnited States. If a lawful permanent resident has been\nconvicted at any time of certain crimes (what the immigra-\ntion laws refer to as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d), then the\nnoncitizen is not eligible for cancellation of removal. If dur-\ning the initial 7-year period of residence, a lawful perma-\nnent resident committed certain other offenses referred to\nin \u00a71182(a)(2), then the noncitizen likewise is not eligible\nfor cancellation of removal.\n   In providing that a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes (in addition\nto the offense of removal) can render him ineligible for can-\ncellation of removal, the cancellation-of-removal statute\nfunctions like a traditional recidivist sentencing statute. In\nan ordinary criminal case, a defendant may be convicted of\na particular criminal offense. And at sentencing, the de-\nfendant\u2019s other criminal offenses may be relevant. So too\nin the immigration removal context. A noncitizen may be\nfound removable based on a certain criminal offense. In ap-\nplying for cancellation of removal, the noncitizen must de-\ntail his entire criminal record on Form EOIR\u201342A. An im-\nmigration judge then must determine whether the\nnoncitizen has been convicted of an aggravated felony at\nany time or has committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the\ninitial seven years of residence. It is entirely ordinary to\nlook beyond the offense of conviction at criminal sentencing,\nand it is likewise entirely ordinary to look beyond the of-\nfense of removal at the cancellation-of-removal stage in im-\nmigration cases.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 If the offense of removal itself was an aggravated felony or was an\n\noffense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) that was committed during the initial seven\nyears of residence, then the offense of removal alone precludes cancella-\ntion of removal, regardless of whether the noncitizen has an additional\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)        9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   It is not surprising, moreover, that Congress required im-\nmigration judges considering cancellation of removal to\nlook in part at whether the noncitizen has committed any\noffenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2). The offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) help determine whether a noncitizen should be\nadmitted to the United States. Under the cancellation-of-\nremoval statute, immigration judges must look at that\nsame category of offenses to determine whether, after a pre-\nviously admitted noncitizen has been determined to be de-\nportable, the noncitizen should nonetheless be allowed to\nremain in the United States. If a crime is serious enough\nto deny admission to a noncitizen, the crime can also be se-\nrious enough to preclude cancellation of removal, at least if\ncommitted during the initial seven years of residence.\n   Importantly, the text of the cancellation-of-removal stat-\nute does not simply say that cancellation of removal is pre-\ncluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the\nnoncitizen was convicted of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). Rather, the text says that cancellation of re-\nmoval is precluded when, during the initial seven years of\nresidence, the noncitizen \u201ccommitted an offense referred to\nin section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissi-\nble.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). That language clarifies two points of\nrelevance here.\n   First, cancellation of removal is precluded if a noncitizen\ncommitted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven\nyears of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the convic-\ntion occurred after the seven years elapsed. In other words,\nas Congress specified in the statute and as the BIA and the\nCourts of Appeals have recognized, the date of commission\nof the offense is the key date for purposes of calculating\nwhether the noncitizen committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense\nduring the initial seven years of residence. See In re Perez,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrecord of prior crimes.\n\f10                    BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n22 I. & N. Dec. 689, 693\u2013694 (BIA 1999) (date of commis-\nsion is controlling date); see also Heredia, 865 F. 3d, at 70\u2013\n71 (\u201cthe date of the commission of the offense governs the\ncomputation of a lawful permanent resident\u2019s continuous\nresidency in the United States\u201d); Calix, 784 F. 3d, at 1012\n(\u201cOnce he was convicted of the offense\u201d referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2), \u201che was rendered inadmissible to the United\nStates. His accrual of continuous residence was halted as\nof the date he committed that offense\u201d).\n   Second, the text of the law requires that the noncitizen\nbe rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d as a result of the offense. For\ncrimes involving moral turpitude, which is the relevant cat-\negory of \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses here, \u00a71182(a)(2) provides that\na noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when he is con-\nvicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). As the\nEleventh Circuit explained, \u201cwhile only commission is re-\nquired at step one, conviction (or admission) is required at\nstep two.\u201d 904 F. 3d, at 1301.\n   In this case, Barton\u2019s 1996 state aggravated assault of-\nfenses were crimes involving moral turpitude and therefore\n\u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2).\u201d Barton committed those\noffenses during his initial seven years of residence. He was\nlater convicted of the offenses in a Georgia court and\nthereby rendered \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Therefore, Barton was in-\neligible for cancellation of removal.\n   As a matter of statutory text and structure, that analysis\nis straightforward. The Board of Immigration Appeals has\nlong interpreted the statute that way. See Jurado-Delgado,\n24 I. & N. Dec., at 31. And except for the Ninth Circuit, all\nof the Courts of Appeals to consider the question have in-\nterpreted the statute that way.\n                            B\n  Barton pushes back on that straightforward statutory in-\nterpretation and the longstanding position of the Board of\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nImmigration Appeals. Barton says that he may not be de-\nnied cancellation of removal based on his 1996 aggravated\nassault offenses because those offenses were not among the\noffenses of removal found by the Immigration Judge in Bar-\nton\u2019s removal proceeding. Rather, his 1996 firearms offense\nand his 2007 and 2008 drug offenses were the offenses of\nremoval.\n   To succinctly summarize the parties\u2019 different positions\n(with the difference highlighted in italics below): The Gov-\nernment would preclude cancellation of removal under this\nprovision if the lawful permanent resident committed a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of resi-\ndence. Barton would preclude cancellation of removal un-\nder this provision if the lawful permanent resident commit-\nted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of\nresidence and if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the of-\nfenses of removal in the noncitizen\u2019s removal proceeding.\n   To support his \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach, Barton ad-\nvances three different arguments. A caution to the reader:\nThese arguments are not easy to unpack.\n   First, according to Barton, the statute\u2019s overall structure\nwith respect to removal proceedings demonstrates that a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense may preclude cancellation of removal\nonly if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the offenses of\nremoval. We disagree. In removal proceedings, a lawful\npermanent resident (such as Barton) may be found \u201cdeport-\nable\u201d based on deportability offenses listed in \u00a71227(a)(2).\nA noncitizen who has not previously been admitted may be\nfound \u201cinadmissible\u201d based on inadmissibility offenses\nlisted in \u00a71182(a)(2). See \u00a7\u00a71182(a), 1227(a), 1229a(e)(2).\nImportantly, then, \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\nfenses\u2014are typically the basis for removal of lawful perma-\nnent residents.\n   Because the offense of removal for lawful permanent res-\nidents is ordinarily a \u00a71227(a)(2) offense, Barton\u2019s struc-\ntural argument falls apart. If Barton were correct that this\n\f12                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naspect of the cancellation-of-removal statute focused only\non the offense of removal, the statute presumably would\nspecify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or section\n1227(a)(2).\u201d So why does the statute identify only offenses\n\u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d? Barton has no good an-\nswer. At oral argument, when directly asked that question,\nBarton\u2019s able counsel forthrightly acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s a lit-\ntle hard to explain.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.\n   This point is the Achilles\u2019 heel of Barton\u2019s structural ar-\ngument. As we see it, Barton cannot explain the omission\nof \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses in the \u201creferred to\u201d clause for a sim-\nple reason: Barton\u2019s interpretation of the statute is incor-\nrect. Properly read, this is not simply an \u201coffense of re-\nmoval\u201d statute that looks only at whether the offense of\nremoval was committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence. Rather, this is a recidivist statute that uses\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses as a shorthand cross-reference for a\ncategory of offenses that will preclude cancellation of re-\nmoval if committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence.\n   By contrast to this cancellation-of-removal provision,\nsome other provisions of the immigration laws do focus only\non the offense of removal\u2014for example, provisions govern-\ning mandatory detention and jurisdiction. See \u00a7\u00a71226(a),\n(c)(1)(A), (B), 1252(a)(2)(C). But the statutory text and con-\ntext of those provisions support that limitation. Those pro-\nvisions use the phrase \u201cinadmissible by reason of \u201d a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense, \u201cdeportable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71227(a)(2)\noffense, or \u201cremovable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71182(a)(2) or\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense. And the provisions make contextual\nsense only if the offense justifying detention or denying ju-\nrisdiction is one of the offenses of removal. The cancellation-\nof-removal statute does not employ similar language.\n   Second, moving from overall structure to precise text,\nBarton seizes on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an of-\nfense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

According\nto Barton, conviction of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2)\u2014for\nexample, conviction in state court of a crime involving\nmoral turpitude\u2014does not itself render the noncitizen \u201cin-\nadmissible.\u201d He argues that a noncitizen is not rendered\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d unless and until the noncitizen is actually\nadjudicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the\nUnited States. And he further contends that a lawfully ad-\nmitted noncitizen usually cannot be removed from the\nUnited States on the basis of inadmissibility. As Barton\nputs it (and the dissent echoes the point), how can a law-\nfully admitted noncitizen be found inadmissible when he\nhas already been lawfully admitted?\n  As a matter of common parlance alone, that argument\nwould of course carry some force. But the argument fails\nbecause it disregards the statutory text, which employs the\nterm \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a status that can result from, for\nexample, a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully admitted\nnoncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2).\n  For example, as relevant here, \u00a71182(a)(2) flatly says that\na noncitizen such as Barton who commits a crime involving\nmoral turpitude and is convicted of that offense \u201cis inadmis-\nsible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). Full stop. Similarly, a noncitizen\nwho has two or more convictions, together resulting in ag-\ngregate sentences of at least five years, \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n\u00a71182(a)(2)(B). A noncitizen who a consular officer or the\nAttorney General knows or has reason to believe is a drug\ntrafficker \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(i). A noncitizen\nwho receives the proceeds of prostitution within 10 years of\napplying for admission \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(D)(ii).\nThe list goes on. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(ii)\u2013(E), (G)\u2013(I).\nThose provisions do not say that a noncitizen will become\ninadmissible if the noncitizen is found inadmissible in a\nsubsequent immigration removal proceeding. Instead,\n\f14                      BARTON v. BARR\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthose provisions say that the noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n  Congress has in turn made that status\u2014inadmissibility\nbecause of conviction or other proof of commission of\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014relevant in several statutory contexts\nthat apply to lawfully admitted noncitizens such as Barton.\nThose contexts include adjustment to permanent resident\nstatus; protection from removal because of temporary pro-\ntected status; termination of temporary resident status;\nand here cancellation of removal. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C),\n(a)(3)(B)(ii), 1254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii), 1255(a), (l)(2). In\nthose contexts, the noncitizen faces immigration conse-\nquences from being convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even\nthough the noncitizen is lawfully admitted and is not nec-\nessarily removable solely because of that offense.\n  Consider how those other proceedings work. A lawfully\nadmitted noncitizen who is convicted of an offense listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) is typically not removable from the United\nStates on that basis (recall that a lawfully admitted noncit-\nizen is ordinarily removable only for commission of a\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense). But the noncitizen is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause of the \u00a71182(a)(2) offense and for that reason may\nnot be able to obtain adjustment to permanent resident sta-\ntus. \u00a7\u00a71255(a), (l)(2). So too, a lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho is convicted of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) is \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d and for that reason may not be able to obtain tem-\nporary protected status. \u00a7\u00a71254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii). A\nlawfully admitted noncitizen who is a temporary resident\nand is convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand for that reason may lose temporary resident status.\n\u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii).\n  Those statutory examples pose a major hurdle for Bar-\nton\u2019s textual argument. The examples demonstrate that\nCongress has employed the concept of \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as\na status in a variety of statutes similar to the cancellation-\nof-removal statute, including for lawfully admitted nonciti-\nzens. Barton has no persuasive answer to those examples.\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            15\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nBarton tries to say that some of those other statutes involve\na noncitizen who, although already admitted to the United\nStates, is nonetheless seeking \u201cconstructive admission.\u201d\nReply Brief 12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But that ginned-up label\ndoes not avoid the problem. Put simply, those other stat-\nutes show that lawfully admitted noncitizens who are, for\nexample, convicted of \u00a71182(a)(2) crimes are \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand in turn may suffer certain immigration consequences,\neven though those lawfully admitted noncitizens cannot\nnecessarily be removed solely because of those \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffenses.\n   The same is true here. A lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude dur-\ning his initial seven years of residence is \u201cinadmissible\u201d and\nfor that reason is ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n   In advancing his structural and textual arguments, Bar-\nton insists that his interpretation of the statute reflects con-\ngressional intent regarding cancellation of removal. But if\nCongress intended that only the offense of removal would\npreclude cancellation of removal under the 7-year residence\nprovision, it is unlikely that Congress would have employed\nsuch a convoluted way to express that intent. Barton can-\nnot explain why, if his view of Congress\u2019 intent is correct,\nthe statute does not simply say something like: \u201cThe alien\nis not eligible for cancellation of removal if the offense of\nremoval was committed during the alien\u2019s initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d\n   Third, on a different textual tack, Barton argues that the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation cannot be correct because the\nGovernment would treat as surplusage the phrase \u201cor re-\nmovable from the United States under section 1227(a)(2) or\n1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d Recall that the statute, as relevant\nhere, provides that a lawful permanent resident is not eli-\ngible for cancellation of removal if, during the initial seven\nyears of residence, he committed \u201can offense referred to in\n\f16                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the alien inad-\nmissible to the United States under section 1182(a)(2) of\nthis title or removable from the United States under section\n1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (em-\nphasis added).\n   To begin with, all agree that under either side\u2019s interpre-\ntation, the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4)\u2014as distinct from\n\u00a71227(a)(2)\u2014is redundant surplusage. See \u00a71229b(c)(4);\nBrief for Petitioner 32\u201333 & n. 7. Under the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation, it is true that the reference to \u00a71227(a)(2)\nalso appears to be redundant surplusage. Any offense that\nis both referred to in \u00a71182(a)(2) and an offense that would\nrender the noncitizen deportable under \u00a71227(a)(2) would\nalso render the noncitizen inadmissible under \u00a71182(a)(2).\nBut redundancies are common in statutory drafting\u2014some-\ntimes in a congressional effort to be doubly sure, sometimes\nbecause of congressional inadvertence or lack of foresight,\nor sometimes simply because of the shortcomings of human\ncommunication. The Court has often recognized: \u201cSome-\ntimes the better overall reading of the statute contains\nsome redundancy.\u201d Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc.,\n586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11); see Wisconsin Cen-\ntral Ltd. v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op.,\nat 7); Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. 371, 385\n(2013); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 536\n(2004). So it is here. Most importantly for present pur-\nposes, we do not see why the redundant statutory reference\nto \u00a71227(a)(2) should cause us to entirely rewrite \u00a71229b so\nthat a noncitizen\u2019s commission of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) would preclude cancellation of removal only if it\nis also the offense of removal. Redundancy in one portion\nof a statute is not a license to rewrite or eviscerate another\nportion of the statute contrary to its text, as Barton would\nhave us do.\n   One final point: Barton argues in the alternative that\neven if inadmissibility is a status, and even if the offense\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat precludes cancellation of removal need not be one of\nthe offenses of removal, the noncitizen must at least have\nbeen capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmis-\nsibility offense as the basis for removal. The dissent seizes\non this argument as well. But as we have explained, this\ncancellation-of-removal statute is a recidivist statute that\nprecludes cancellation of removal if the noncitizen has com-\nmitted an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial\nseven years of residence. Whether the offense that pre-\ncludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have\nbeen charged as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant\nto that analysis.\n                         *     *    *\n   Removal of a lawful permanent resident from the United\nStates is a wrenching process, especially in light of the con-\nsequences for family members. Removal is particularly dif-\nficult when it involves someone such as Barton who has\nspent most of his life in the United States. Congress made\na choice, however, to authorize removal of noncitizens\u2014\neven lawful permanent residents\u2014who have committed\ncertain serious crimes. And Congress also made a choice to\ncategorically preclude cancellation of removal for nonciti-\nzens who have substantial criminal records. Congress may\nof course amend the law at any time. In the meantime, the\nCourt is constrained to apply the law as enacted by Con-\ngress. Here, as the BIA explained in its 2006 Jurado-\nDelgado decision, and as the Second, Third, Fifth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits have indicated, the immigration laws enacted\nby Congress do not allow cancellation of removal when a\nlawful permanent resident has amassed a criminal record\nof this kind.\n   We affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

But to trigger the rule, it takes more than\ncommission of a specified criminal offense: The offense\nmust also render a noncitizen either \u201cinadmissible\u201d or \u201cde-\nportable.\u201d In applying these important limitations, the rule\ndirectly references the two-track nature of the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), a statute that has long distin-\nguished between noncitizens seeking admission and those\nalready admitted. Inadmissibility, of course, pertains to\nnoncitizens seeking admission; deportability relates to\nnoncitizens already admitted but removable.\n  The majority errs by conflating these two terms. It con-\ncludes that the term \u201cinadmissible,\u201d for the purposes of the\nstop-time rule, refers to a status that a noncitizen could ac-\nquire even if he or she is not seeking admission. Under this\nlogic, petitioner Andre Barton is inadmissible yet, at the\nsame time, lawfully admitted. Neither the express lan-\nguage of the statute nor any interpretative canons support\nthis paradox; Barton cannot and should not be considered\ninadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule because he\nhas already been admitted to the country.

To obtain this relief, both\ngroups must continuously reside in the United States for a\ncertain amount of time. \u00a71229b(a)(2) (seven years for\nLPRs); \u00a71229b(b)(1)(A) (10 years for non-LPR noncitizens).\n  The stop-time rule ends a noncitizen\u2019s period of continu-\nous residence (1) when the noncitizen \u201chas committed an\noffense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d that\neither (2) \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible to the\nUnited States under section 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or (3)\nrenders the noncitizen \u201cremovable from the United States\nunder section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(d)(1). The second clause directly invokes grounds of\ninadmissibility; the third clause, although using the term\n\u201cremovable,\u201d directly invokes grounds of deportability. See\n\u00a71227(a) (specifying \u201c[c]lasses of deportable aliens\u201d).1 Both\nthe second and the third clauses are cabined by the first: In\naddition to rendering a noncitizen either inadmissible or\ndeportable, the offense must also be one \u201creferred to\u201d in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). That provision includes some\u2014but not all\u2014of\nthe grounds of deportability in \u00a71227.\n  This distinction between \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d\nmatters. Indeed, both are terms of art, so it is critical to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because the third clause refers to grounds of deportability, the Gov-\n\nernment appears to agree that the terms \u201cremovable\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d\nare interchangeable.

Although the grounds for\nexclusion and deportation\u2014and the procedures applying to\neach\u2014evolved over time, the immigration laws retained a\ntwo-track system; different procedures and processes ap-\nplied to noncitizens who were deportable and noncitizens\nwho were excludable.

S., at 46. IIRIRA also altered when a noncitizen faces\ngrounds of inadmissibility, formerly exclusion: Rather than\nfocusing on whether a noncitizen had physically entered the\ncountry, the statute now asks whether the noncitizen had\nbeen lawfully admitted, in any status, to the country. See\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(13)(A), 1182(a).\n  Still, the immigration laws have retained their two-track\nstructure. Inadmissibility and deportability remain sepa-\nrate concepts, triggered by different grounds. With few ex-\nceptions, the grounds for inadmissibility are broader than\nthose for deportability. Compare \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) with\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i) (reflecting different treatment for crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude). Further, while a noncitizen\n\f4                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncharged with inadmissibility bears the ultimate burden to\nshow that he is admissible, the Government bears the bur-\nden of demonstrating that a noncitizen is deportable.\n\u00a7\u00a71229a(c)(2), (c)(3).\n   Whether a noncitizen is charged with inadmissibility or\ndeportability also affects what the noncitizen or the Gov-\nernment must show to carry their respective burdens. A\ncriminal ground for inadmissibility can be made out by\nshowing either that the noncitizen admitted to conduct\nmeeting the elements of a crime or that she was actually\nconvicted of an offense. See, e.g., Pazcoguin v. Radcliffe,\n292 F. 3d 1209, 1213\u20131215 (CA9 2002) (noncitizen inadmis-\nsible because he admitted to health officer that he smoked\nmarijuana in his youth); see also \u00a71182(a)(2)(A). By con-\ntrast, most criminal grounds for deportability can be estab-\nlished only through convictions. See \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(v),\n(a)(2)(B)(i).\n   Finally, the substantive standards for cancellation of re-\nmoval are also less stringent for a subset of deportable\nnoncitizens: LPRs like Barton. Among other things, while\nan otherwise-eligible LPR must merely demonstrate that\nhe or she deserves the relief as a matter of discretion, see\nIn re C-V-T-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7, 10\u201311 (BIA 1998), non-LPRs\nmust demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual\nhardship to an LPR or citizen parent, spouse, or child,\n\u00a71229b(b)(1)(D).\n   These separate categories and procedures\u2014treating de-\nportable noncitizens more generously than inadmissible\nnoncitizens, and treating one group of deportable nonciti-\nzens (LPRs) the most generously of all\u2014stem from one an-\nimating principle. All noncitizens in this country are enti-\ntled to certain rights and protections, but the protections\nafforded to previously admitted noncitizens and LPRs are\nparticularly strong. See Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 543\u2013\n544 (2003) (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

Indeed, \u201c[t]he immigration laws give LPRs the op-\nportunity to establish a life permanently in this country by\ndeveloping economic, familial, and social ties indistinguish-\nable from those of a citizen.\u201d Id., at 544. Because those\nalready admitted, like Barton, are often presumed to have\ngreater connections to the country, the immigration laws\nuse separate terms and create separate procedures for\nnoncitizens seeking admission to the country on the one\nhand, and those who were previously admitted on the other.\n  The stop-time rule carries that distinction forward. The\nrule specifies how a period of continuous residence ends for\nnoncitizens who are seeking admission and thus are inad-\nmissible, as well as noncitizens who are already admitted\nand thus are deportable. By using separate terms and\ngrounds for two groups of people, the stop-time rule thus\nreflects the two-track dichotomy for inadmissible or deport-\nable noncitizens that pervades the INA.\n                               B\n  Barton is a longtime lawfully admitted resident of the\nUnited States. He and his mother moved to the United\nStates from Jamaica when he was about 10 years old. They\nboth entered legally and, through Barton\u2019s stepfather, soon\nadjusted their status to LPRs. When Barton was placed in\nremoval proceedings, all of his immediate family\u2014his\nmother, his children, his fiancee\u2014were living in the United\nStates. He had not returned to Jamaica in 25 years.\n  Barton was first arrested in 1996, when he was 17 or 18,\nafter a friend shot at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house while he was\npresent. Both he and his friend were convicted of, among\nother things, aggravated assault and possession of a fire-\narm. Barton later testified before an immigration judge\nthat he was unaware that his friend had a gun or was plan-\nning to shoot it.\n  After attending a boot camp and obtaining his GED, Bar-\nton led a law-abiding life for several years. But in the mid-\n\f6                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n2000s, Barton developed a drug problem and was convicted\ntwice on possession charges. After attending two drug re-\nhabilitation programs, Barton was never arrested again.\nHe graduated from college, began running an automobile\nrepair shop, and became a father to four young children.\n  Just a few years ago\u2014nearly 10 years after his last ar-\nrest\u2014the Government detained Barton and placed him in\nremoval proceedings. Because he had been lawfully admit-\nted to the country, the Government could not charge him\nwith any grounds of inadmissibility. Rather, the Govern-\nment charged, and Barton conceded, that he was deportable\nbased on prior firearms and drug convictions. (All agree\nthat Barton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense did not qualify as\na deportable offense under \u00a71227.) Barton then sought can-\ncellation of removal.\n  Perhaps recognizing that Barton had a strong case for\ncancellation of removal on the merits, see C-V-T-, 22 I. & N.\nDec., at 11 (factors such as \u201cfamily ties within the United\nStates, residence of long duration in this country (particu-\nlarly when the inception of residence occurred at a young\nage),\u201d and \u201cbusiness ties\u201d all favor a noncitizen seeking can-\ncellation), the Government contended that Barton was cat-\negorically ineligible for that relief. It reasoned that Bar-\nton\u2019s prior offenses triggered the stop-time rule and that\nBarton therefore could not meet the continuous-residence\nrequirement.\n  The problem (for the Government) was finding a prior of-\nfense that actually triggered the stop-time rule. None of the\noffenses that had made Barton deportable\u2014his firearms\nand drug convictions\u2014satisfied the stop-time rule\u2019s first\nclause because \u00a71182(a)(2) does not \u201crefe[r] to\u201d those of-\nfenses. The Government therefore could not argue that\nBarton\u2019s firearms and drug offenses ended Barton\u2019s period\nof continuous residence under the stop-time rule. As for\nBarton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense, it was not a ground for\ndeportability under \u00a71227(a) and therefore did not render\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

That is, although the Government could\nnot charge Barton with inadmissibility, it relied upon a\nground of inadmissibility to assert that Barton was not en-\ntitled to relief from removal.\n   The Immigration Judge agreed with the Government.\nThe judge made clear, however, that she would have\ngranted Barton\u2019s cancellation application had he satisfied\nthe continuous-residence requirement. The judge cited,\namong other things, Barton\u2019s strong family ties, including\nhis four young children who were all U. S. citizens. The\njudge concluded that because \u201chis last arrest was over 10\nyears ago,\u201d Barton \u201cis clearly rehabilitated.\u201d The judge also\nconcluded that Barton\u2019s family \u201crelies on him and would\nsuffer hardship if he were to be deported to Jamaica.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 36a.\n                             II\n  Barton makes two arguments to this Court. The Court\nfocuses on the first\u2014that the stop-time rule will \u201crende[r]\u201d\na noncitizen inadmissible only if the person is actually ad-\njudicated inadmissible based on the given offense. But\nwhether Barton is right on that score is irrelevant because\nBarton\u2019s second argument\u2014which the Court fails to grap-\nple with meaningfully\u2014is surely correct: At the very least,\nan offense cannot \u201crende[r]\u201d someone inadmissible unless\nthe Government can legally charge that noncitizen with a\nground of inadmissibility. That is, the stop-time rule is con-\nsistent with basic immigration law: A noncitizen who has\nalready been admitted, and is not seeking readmission, can-\nnot be charged with any ground of inadmissibility and thus\ncannot be deemed inadmissible.\n\f8                           BARTON v. BARR\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Because the stop-time rule uses the terms \u201cremovable\u201d\n(i.e., deportable) and \u201cinadmissible\u201d in the disjunctive, the\nCourt must analyze the rule against the INA\u2019s historic two-\ntrack backdrop. That context confirms that the term \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d cannot refer to a noncitizen who, like Barton, has\nalready been admitted and is not seeking readmission. In-\ndeed, the terms \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d are mutu-\nally exclusive in removal proceedings: A noncitizen can be\ndeemed either inadmissible or deportable, not both.\n\u00a71229a(e) (for the purposes of removal statute and\n\u00a71229b\u2014governing cancellation of removal\u2014a noncitizen is\n\u201cinadmissible under section 1182\u201d if \u201cnot admitted to the\nUnited States,\u201d and \u201cdeportable under section 1227\u201d if \u201cad-\nmitted to the United States\u201d). For the purposes of the stop-\ntime rule, a person is not \u201cinadmissible\u201d unless that person\nactually seeks admission, and thus is subject to charges of\ninadmissibility.\n   After all, if the provision applied to those who could hy-\npothetically be rendered inadmissible, it could have said so.\nFor example, the statute would have said that it applied\nwhen \u201cthe alien has committed an offense referred to in sec-\ntion 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d that either (2) \u201ccould render the\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or (3) could render the noncitizen\n\u201cremovable [i.e., deportable] from the United States under\nsection 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court seems to suggest that the stop-time rule\u2019s tense simply\n\nmirrors \u00a71182(a)(2). See ante, at 13\u201314. It is true that \u00a71182(a)(2)\nspeaks in the present tense, stating that a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible\u201d if\nshe has been \u201cconvicted of \u201d or \u201cadmits having committed\u201d certain of-\nfenses. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). But the Court\u2019s argument does not follow. Sec-\ntion 1182, by its terms, applies only to \u201c[c]lasses of aliens ineligible for\nvisas or admission.\u201d \u00a71182(a). Because the provision applies only to\nnoncitizens seeking admission, it is only natural that the clause uses the\npresent tense to describe when such a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d By\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

United States, 556\nU. S. 303, 314 (2009) (internal quotation marks and altera-\ntion omitted). Were the stop-time rule agnostic to whether\nthe noncitizen actually seeks admission, then the rule\u2019s\nthird clause\u2014regarding deportability\u2014would be meaning-\nless. When a noncitizen is \u201cremovable\u201d\u2014i.e., deportable\u2014\nunder \u00a71227 for an offense \u201creferred to\u201d in \u00a71182(a)(2), he\nor she is also \u201cinadmissible\u201d for an offense \u201creferred to\u201d in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). The third clause has meaning only if inadmis-\nsibility and deportability apply, as they always have, to sep-\narate groups of noncitizens\u2014noncitizens seeking admission\non the one hand, and noncitizens already admitted on the\nother.\n   To be sure, there are limited exceptions to the general\nrule that questions of admissibility apply only to nonciti-\nzens seeking formal admission. Noncitizens applying for\nadjustment of status must establish admissibility.\n\u00a7\u00a71255(a), (l)(2). But that is because adjustment of status\nis an express proxy for admission: \u201cCongress created the\n[process] to enable an alien physically present in the United\nStates to become an LPR without incurring the expense and\ninconvenience of traveling abroad to obtain an immigrant\nvisa\u201d and then presumably demonstrating admissibility on\nreturn.

BARR\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nup label,\u201d ante, at 15, the term \u201cconstructive admission\u201d ex-\npresses precisely how the INA conceives of adjustment of\nstatus: an admissions process that occurs inside the United\nStates as opposed to outside of it.\n  Alternatively, the Government also relies on two narrow\nprovisions of the INA applicable to \u201c[s]pecial agricultural\nworkers,\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71160(a)(3)(B)(ii), and \u201ccertain en-\ntrants before January 1, 1982,\u201d \u00a71255a(b)(2)(B). These pro-\nvisions, it argues, demonstrate that throughout the INA,\ninadmissibility is a status untethered to admission. But\nthese provisions, too, refer to noncitizens seeking adjust-\nment of status. \u00a71160(a)(1) (setting procedures for adjust-\nment of status of certain noncitizens); \u00a71255a(a) (same).3\nEven if the Government were correct that these statutes\ndeem a noncitizen inadmissible outside of an application for\nadmission, its argument would rise and fall on a few provi-\nsions within the expansive INA.4 In any event, neither of\nthese provisions is similar in structure and purpose to the\nstop-time rule. Neither refers to grounds of inadmissibility\nand grounds of deportability in tandem. What is more, nei-\nther appears to confer or deny relief exclusively in removal\nproceedings\u2014where the dichotomy between inadmissibility\nand deportability is most important.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Indeed, one of the provisions suggests that, outside the context in\n\nwhich a noncitizen seeks adjustment of status (and thus seeks construc-\ntive admission), a noncitizen\u2019s status can be terminated \u201conly upon a de-\ntermination . . . that the alien is deportable.\u201d \u00a71160(a)(3)(A).\n   4 The Government also notes that a noncitizen would be deportable\n\nwere she inadmissible at entry (or during adjustment of status) but er-\nroneously admitted (or allowed to adjust status). Brief for Respondent\n18\u201319 (citing \u00a71227(a)(1)(A)). But this provision directly undermines the\nGovernment\u2019s reading of the statute. Were inadmissibility a status un-\ntethered to admission, a noncitizen inadmissible at the time of entry\nwould always be inadmissible. But because a noncitizen who was al-\nready admitted cannot be adjudicated inadmissible, Congress made er-\nroneous admission a ground of deportability, not inadmissibility.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            11\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   By contrast, the Government concedes that the term \u201cin-\nadmissible\u201d in the mandatory-detention statute\u2014a provi-\nsion structurally similar to the stop-time rule\u2014applies only\nto noncitizens capable of being charged with inadmissibil-\nity. Brief for Respondent 30. That provision specifies, in\nrelevant part, that the Government \u201cshall take into custody\nany alien who\u2014(A) is inadmissible by reason of having com-\nmitted any offense covered in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d or \u201c(C) is\ndeportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) . . . on the basis of\nan offense for which the alien has been sentence[d] to a\nterm of imprisonment of at least 1 year.\u201d \u00a71226(c)(1) (foot-\nnote omitted).\n   Although the term \u201cinadmissible\u201d in this context does not\nrefer to an actual adjudication of inadmissibility, see\nDemore, 538 U. S., at 513, 531, the Government accepts\nthat it must at least refer to a possible charge on a nonciti-\nzen seeking admission. Brief for Respondent 30. Other-\nwise, the statute would subject already-admitted nonciti-\nzens\u2014even those who are not deportable for any criminal\noffense\u2014to mandatory detention, simply because they oc-\ncupy the \u201cstatus\u201d of inadmissibility. This provision\u2019s struc-\nture is virtually the same as the stop-time rule: It refers to\ngrounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportability sep-\narately and applies to a noncitizen in removal proceedings.\n   Given the similar structure, the stop-time rule should be\nread the same as the mandatory-detention provision: to re-\nfer to adjudications that are possible rather than impossi-\nble. If a noncitizen seeking admission has committed a\ncrime under \u00a71182(a)(2) and is convicted of or admits to the\noffense, that offense \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause the noncitizen can be charged and found inadmis-\nsible based on that crime. But such an offense does not ren-\nder a noncitizen inadmissible if, like Barton, he or she was\nadmitted years earlier and does not seek readmission. For\na noncitizen who has already been admitted, Congress\ncarved out a separate category of offenses in both the stop-\n\f12                    BARTON v.

At various points the Court\nseems to ignore the rule\u2019s second and third clauses en-\ntirely\u2014clauses that, as mentioned above, distinguish be-\ntween grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportabil-\nity. The Court insists that the statute \u201coperates like\ntraditional criminal recidivist laws\u201d because it precludes\ncancellation of removal for a noncitizen who \u201chas committed\nan offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d Ante, at 2; see also ante, at 7, 8, n. 5,\n17.\n   Had Congress intended for commission of a crime in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) alone to trigger the stop-time rule, it would\nhave said so. In fact, it would have stopped at the rule\u2019s\nfirst clause, which (without more) states the Court\u2019s rule:\nthat the time of continuous residence stops whenever a\nnoncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in section\n1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1).\n   But that reading ignores the rest of what Congress wrote.\nCongress specified that it is not enough for a noncitizen to\ncommit a crime listed in \u00a71182(a)(2); that crime must also\n\u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible to the United States under\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or \u201cremovable from the\nUnited States under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this\ntitle.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1). Those words have meaning\u2014invoking\nthe two-track structure of the INA and the distinction be-\ntween grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportabil-\nity\u2014and the Court cannot simply will them out of existence.\n   Even when the Court finally discusses the second clause,\n\u201crenders the alien inadmissible,\u201d the Court raises more\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

First, the Court claims, the clause\nmakes clear that \u201ccancellation of removal is precluded if an\nalien committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial\nseven years of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the\nconviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\u201d Ante, at\n9. Despite the emphasis the Court lays on this point, it is\nirrelevant to this case: Barton does not dispute that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by the date of commission of a\ncrime rather than a later date of conviction. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 9, n. 4. The question in this case is whether certain\noffenses can possibly render Barton inadmissible when he\ndoes not seek admission and has already been admitted\u2014\nregardless of whether one looks to the date of commission\nor the date of conviction of those offenses.5\n   Even if this question mattered and were properly before\nus, Congress could have made the same point\u2014that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by commission of a crime\u2014by\nomitting the second and third clauses entirely. It again\ncould have written what the Court, at various points, seems\nto wish it had written: The stop-time rule is triggered when-\never a noncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d The second and third\nclauses\u2014which refer to later events, when a noncitizen is\nactually \u201crender[ed]\u201d inadmissible or deportable\u2014make the\nCourt\u2019s aside less plausible, not more.\n   The Court next insists that the second clause makes clear\nthat the crime must \u201crende[r]\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissi-\nble\u201d\u2014which, in the Court\u2019s view, requires only that a\nnoncitizen admit the crime or be convicted of it.

Brief for Momodoulamin Jobe et al.\nas Amici Curiae 12\u201313. Because this point about the trigger date is nei-\nther disputed here nor briefed by either party, the Court\u2019s opinion should\nnot be read to resolve a Circuit split that is not before this Court.\n\f14                     BARTON v.

The\nCourt also fails to clarify why, if conviction or admission\nalone renders any noncitizen inadmissible regardless of ad-\nmission status, Congress chose to add a third clause refer-\nring to grounds of deportability.\n  Indeed, what does the Court do about the canon against\nsurplusage? The Court does not dispute that its reading\nmakes the entire third clause of the stop-time rule mean-\ningless.

It is also at odds with common sense. With virtually\nevery other provision of the INA, Congress granted prefer-\nential treatment to lawfully admitted noncitizens\u2014and\nmost of all to LPRs like Barton. But because of the Court\u2019s\nopinion today, noncitizens who were already admitted to\nthe country are treated, for the purposes of the stop-time\nrule, identically to those who were not\u2014despite Congress\u2019\nexpress references to inadmissibility and deportability.\nThe result is that, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, an im-\nmigration judge may not even consider whether Barton is\nentitled to cancellation of removal\u2014because of an offense\nthat Congress deemed too trivial to allow for Barton\u2019s re-\nmoval in the first instance.

If the lawful permanent resident is found\n removable, the immigration judge may cancel removal, but only if the\n lawful permanent resident meets strict statutory eligibility require-\n ments. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), 1229b(d)(1)(B).\n    Over the span of 12 years, lawful permanent resident Andre Barton\n was convicted of state crimes, including a firearms offense, drug of-\n fenses, and aggravated assault offenses. An Immigration Judge found\n him removable based on his state firearms and drug offenses. Barton\n applied for cancellation of removal. Among the eligibility require-\n ments, a lawful permanent resident must have \u201cresided in the United\n States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any sta-\n tus.\u201d \u00a71229b(a)(2). Another provision, the so-called stop-time rule,\n provides that a continuous period of residence \u201cshall be deemed to end\u201d\n when the lawful permanent resident commits \u201can offense referred to\n in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible to the\n United States under section 1182(a)(2).\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). Because\n Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were committed within his first\n seven years of admission and were covered by \u00a71182(a)(2), the Immi-\n gration Judge concluded that Barton was not eligible for cancellation\n of removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals and the Eleventh Cir-\n cuit agreed.\nHeld: For purposes of cancellation-of-removal eligibility, a \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\n fense committed during the initial seven years of residence does not\n need to be one of the offenses of removal. Pp. 6\u201317.\n    (a) The cancellation-of-removal statute functions like a traditional\n\f2                            BARTON v. BARR\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    recidivist sentencing statute, making a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes rele-\n    vant to eligibility for cancellation of removal. The statute\u2019s text clari-\n    fies two points relevant here. First, cancellation of removal is pre-\n    cluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the noncitizen\n    \u201ccommitted an offense referred to in section 1182(a)(2),\u201d even if (as in\n    Barton\u2019s case) the conviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\n    Second, the offense must \u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible\u201d as a result.\n    For crimes involving moral turpitude, the relevant category here,\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) provides that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when\n    he is convicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n       As a matter of statutory text and structure, the analysis here is\n    straightforward. Barton\u2019s aggravated assault offenses were crimes in-\n    volving moral turpitude and therefore \u201creferred to in section\n    1182(a)(2).\u201d He committed the offenses during his initial seven years\n    of residence and was later convicted of the offenses, thereby rendering\n    him \u201cinadmissible.\u201d Barton was, therefore, ineligible for cancellation\n    of removal. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Barton\u2019s counterarguments are unpersuasive. First, he claims\n    that the statute\u2019s structure supports an \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach.\n    But \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014are ordinarily the\n    basis for removal of lawful permanent residents. Therefore, Barton\u2019s\n    structural argument falls apart. If he were correct, the statute pre-\n    sumably would specify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or sec-\n    tion 1227(a)(2).\u201d By contrast, some other immigration law provisions\n    do focus only on the offense of removal, and their statutory text and\n    context support that limitation.          See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71226(a), (c)(1)(A),\n    1252(a)(2)(C).\n       Second, seizing on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an offense re-\n    ferred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissible\n    to the United States under section 1182(a)(2),\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B), Barton\n    argues that a noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when actually ad-\n    judicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the United States,\n    something that usually cannot happen to a lawfully admitted nonciti-\n    zen. But the statutory text employs the term \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a\n    status that can result from, e.g., a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully\n    admitted noncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n    \u00a71182(a)(2). See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (B). And Congress has made\n    that status relevant in several statutory contexts that apply to law-\n    fully admitted noncitizens such as Barton. In those contexts, a noncit-\n    izen faces immigration consequences from being convicted of a\n    \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even though the noncitizen is lawfully admitted\n    and is not necessarily removable solely because of that offense. See,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii). Such examples pose a major hurdle\n    for Barton\u2019s textual argument, and Barton has no persuasive answer.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     Third, Barton argues that the Government\u2019s interpretation treats as\n  surplusage the phrase \u201cor removable from the United States under\n  section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4).\u201d But redundancies are common in\n  statutory drafting. The Court has often recognized that sometimes the\n  better overall reading of a statute contains some redundancy. And re-\n  dundancy in one portion of a statute is not a license to rewrite or evis-\n  cerate another portion of the statute contrary to its text.\n     Finally, Barton argues alternatively that, even if inadmissibility is\n  a status, and even if the offense that precludes cancellation of removal\n  need not be one of the offenses of removal, a noncitizen must at least\n  have been capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmissibility\n  offense as the basis for removal. Because the cancellation-of-removal\n  statute is a recidivist statute, however, whether the offense that pre-\n  cludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have been charged\n  as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant.

But unlike a U. S. citizen, a lawful permanent\nresident who commits a serious crime may be removed from\nthe United States.\n   Andre Barton is a Jamaican national and a longtime law-\nful permanent resident of the United States. During his\ntime in the United States, Barton has been convicted of\nstate crimes on three separate occasions spanning 12 years.\nThe crimes include a firearms offense, drug offenses, and\naggravated assault offenses. By law, the firearms offense\nand the drug offenses each independently rendered Barton\neligible for removal from the United States. In September\n2016, the U. S. Government sought to remove Barton,\nand a U. S. Immigration Judge determined that Barton was\nremovable.\n   Barton applied for cancellation of removal, a form of relief\nthat allows a noncitizen to remain in the United States de-\n\f2                         BARTON v. BARR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nspite being found removable. The immigration laws author-\nize an immigration judge to cancel removal, but Congress\nhas established strict eligibility requirements.

For a lawful permanent res-\nident such as Barton, the applicant for cancellation of re-\nmoval (1) must have been a lawful permanent resident for\nat least five years; (2) must have continuously resided in\nthe United States for at least seven years after lawful ad-\nmission; (3) must not have been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony as defined in the immigration laws; and (4) during\nthe initial seven years of continuous residence, must not\nhave committed certain other offenses listed in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\u00a71182(a)(2). If a lawful permanent resident meets those el-\nigibility requirements, the immigration judge has discre-\ntion to (but is not required to) cancel removal and allow the\nlawful permanent resident to remain in the United States.\n   Under the cancellation-of-removal statute, the immigra-\ntion judge examines the applicant\u2019s prior crimes, as well as\nthe offense that triggered his removal. If a lawful perma-\nnent resident has ever been convicted of an aggravated fel-\nony, or has committed an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) dur-\ning the initial seven years of residence, that criminal record\nwill preclude cancellation of removal.1 In that way, the\nstatute operates like traditional criminal recidivist laws,\nwhich ordinarily authorize or impose greater sanctions on\noffenders who have committed prior crimes.\n   In this case, after finding Barton removable based on his\nstate firearms and drug offenses, the Immigration Judge\nand the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) concluded that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As the statute makes clear, and as we discuss below, committing a\n\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense precludes cancellation of removal only if the offense\nalso \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen inadmissible. See infra, at 10. Section\n1182(a)(2) specifies what that means for each of its enumerated offenses.\nFor the offense at issue in this case, the noncitizen must also have been\nconvicted of or admitted the offense.\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nBarton was not eligible for cancellation of removal. Barton\nhad committed offenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during his ini-\ntial seven years of residence\u2014namely, his state aggravated\nassault offenses in 1996. Barton\u2019s 1996 aggravated assault\noffenses were not the offenses that triggered his removal.\nBut according to the BIA, and contrary to Barton\u2019s argu-\nment, the offense that precludes cancellation of removal\nneed not be one of the offenses of removal. In re Jurado-\nDelgado, 24 I. & N. Dec. 29, 31 (BIA 2006). The U. S. Court\nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the BIA\u2019s\nreading of the statute and concluded that Barton was not\neligible for cancellation of removal. The Second, Third, and\nFifth Circuits have similarly construed the statute; only the\nNinth Circuit has disagreed.\n   Barton argues that the BIA and the Eleventh Circuit mis-\ninterpreted the statute. He contends that the \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffense that precludes cancellation of removal must be one\nof the offenses of removal. We disagree with Barton, and\nwe affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.\n                             I\n  Federal immigration law governs the admission of\nnoncitizens to the United States and the deportation of\nnoncitizens previously admitted.

The statutory list of aggravated felo-\nnies is long: murder, rape, drug trafficking, firearms traf-\nficking, obstruction of justice, treason, gambling, human\ntrafficking, and tax evasion, among many other crimes.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(A)\u2013(U).\n   In addition, the law precludes cancellation of removal if\nthe lawful permanent resident committed certain other se-\nrious crimes during the initial seven years of residence. The\nlaw defines those offenses by cross-referencing \u00a71182(a)(2),\nwhich specifies the offenses that can render a noncitizen\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d to the United States. Section 1182(a)(2) in-\ncludes \u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude,\u201d which is a gen-\neral category that covers a wide variety of crimes. Section\n1182(a)(2) also expressly encompasses various violations of\ndrug laws, prostitution, money laundering, and certain\nDUIs involving personal injury, among other crimes.\n\f8                         BARTON v. BARR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i), (C), (D), (E), (I); see \u00a71101(h).\n   In specifying when cancellation of removal would be pre-\ncluded because of prior criminal activity, Congress struck a\nbalance that considers both the nature of the prior crime\nand the length of time that the noncitizen has resided in the\nUnited States. If a lawful permanent resident has been\nconvicted at any time of certain crimes (what the immigra-\ntion laws refer to as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d), then the\nnoncitizen is not eligible for cancellation of removal. If dur-\ning the initial 7-year period of residence, a lawful perma-\nnent resident committed certain other offenses referred to\nin \u00a71182(a)(2), then the noncitizen likewise is not eligible\nfor cancellation of removal.\n   In providing that a noncitizen\u2019s prior crimes (in addition\nto the offense of removal) can render him ineligible for can-\ncellation of removal, the cancellation-of-removal statute\nfunctions like a traditional recidivist sentencing statute. In\nan ordinary criminal case, a defendant may be convicted of\na particular criminal offense. And at sentencing, the de-\nfendant\u2019s other criminal offenses may be relevant. So too\nin the immigration removal context. A noncitizen may be\nfound removable based on a certain criminal offense. In ap-\nplying for cancellation of removal, the noncitizen must de-\ntail his entire criminal record on Form EOIR\u201342A. An im-\nmigration judge then must determine whether the\nnoncitizen has been convicted of an aggravated felony at\nany time or has committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the\ninitial seven years of residence. It is entirely ordinary to\nlook beyond the offense of conviction at criminal sentencing,\nand it is likewise entirely ordinary to look beyond the of-\nfense of removal at the cancellation-of-removal stage in im-\nmigration cases.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 If the offense of removal itself was an aggravated felony or was an\n\noffense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) that was committed during the initial seven\nyears of residence, then the offense of removal alone precludes cancella-\ntion of removal, regardless of whether the noncitizen has an additional\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)        9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   It is not surprising, moreover, that Congress required im-\nmigration judges considering cancellation of removal to\nlook in part at whether the noncitizen has committed any\noffenses listed in \u00a71182(a)(2). The offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) help determine whether a noncitizen should be\nadmitted to the United States. Under the cancellation-of-\nremoval statute, immigration judges must look at that\nsame category of offenses to determine whether, after a pre-\nviously admitted noncitizen has been determined to be de-\nportable, the noncitizen should nonetheless be allowed to\nremain in the United States. If a crime is serious enough\nto deny admission to a noncitizen, the crime can also be se-\nrious enough to preclude cancellation of removal, at least if\ncommitted during the initial seven years of residence.\n   Importantly, the text of the cancellation-of-removal stat-\nute does not simply say that cancellation of removal is pre-\ncluded when, during the initial seven years of residence, the\nnoncitizen was convicted of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). Rather, the text says that cancellation of re-\nmoval is precluded when, during the initial seven years of\nresidence, the noncitizen \u201ccommitted an offense referred to\nin section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the alien inadmissi-\nble.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B). That language clarifies two points of\nrelevance here.\n   First, cancellation of removal is precluded if a noncitizen\ncommitted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven\nyears of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the convic-\ntion occurred after the seven years elapsed. In other words,\nas Congress specified in the statute and as the BIA and the\nCourts of Appeals have recognized, the date of commission\nof the offense is the key date for purposes of calculating\nwhether the noncitizen committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense\nduring the initial seven years of residence.

For\ncrimes involving moral turpitude, which is the relevant cat-\negory of \u00a71182(a)(2) offenses here, \u00a71182(a)(2) provides that\na noncitizen is rendered \u201cinadmissible\u201d when he is con-\nvicted of or admits the offense. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i).

S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nImmigration Appeals. Barton says that he may not be de-\nnied cancellation of removal based on his 1996 aggravated\nassault offenses because those offenses were not among the\noffenses of removal found by the Immigration Judge in Bar-\nton\u2019s removal proceeding. Rather, his 1996 firearms offense\nand his 2007 and 2008 drug offenses were the offenses of\nremoval.\n   To succinctly summarize the parties\u2019 different positions\n(with the difference highlighted in italics below): The Gov-\nernment would preclude cancellation of removal under this\nprovision if the lawful permanent resident committed a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of resi-\ndence. Barton would preclude cancellation of removal un-\nder this provision if the lawful permanent resident commit-\nted a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial seven years of\nresidence and if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the of-\nfenses of removal in the noncitizen\u2019s removal proceeding.\n   To support his \u201coffense of removal\u201d approach, Barton ad-\nvances three different arguments. A caution to the reader:\nThese arguments are not easy to unpack.\n   First, according to Barton, the statute\u2019s overall structure\nwith respect to removal proceedings demonstrates that a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense may preclude cancellation of removal\nonly if that \u00a71182(a)(2) offense was one of the offenses of\nremoval. We disagree. In removal proceedings, a lawful\npermanent resident (such as Barton) may be found \u201cdeport-\nable\u201d based on deportability offenses listed in \u00a71227(a)(2).\nA noncitizen who has not previously been admitted may be\nfound \u201cinadmissible\u201d based on inadmissibility offenses\nlisted in \u00a71182(a)(2). See \u00a7\u00a71182(a), 1227(a), 1229a(e)(2).\nImportantly, then, \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses\u2014not \u00a71182(a)(2) of-\nfenses\u2014are typically the basis for removal of lawful perma-\nnent residents.\n   Because the offense of removal for lawful permanent res-\nidents is ordinarily a \u00a71227(a)(2) offense, Barton\u2019s struc-\ntural argument falls apart. If Barton were correct that this\n\f12                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naspect of the cancellation-of-removal statute focused only\non the offense of removal, the statute presumably would\nspecify offenses \u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2) or section\n1227(a)(2).\u201d So why does the statute identify only offenses\n\u201creferred to in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d? Barton has no good an-\nswer. At oral argument, when directly asked that question,\nBarton\u2019s able counsel forthrightly acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s a lit-\ntle hard to explain.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.\n   This point is the Achilles\u2019 heel of Barton\u2019s structural ar-\ngument. As we see it, Barton cannot explain the omission\nof \u00a71227(a)(2) offenses in the \u201creferred to\u201d clause for a sim-\nple reason: Barton\u2019s interpretation of the statute is incor-\nrect. Properly read, this is not simply an \u201coffense of re-\nmoval\u201d statute that looks only at whether the offense of\nremoval was committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence. Rather, this is a recidivist statute that uses\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses as a shorthand cross-reference for a\ncategory of offenses that will preclude cancellation of re-\nmoval if committed during the initial seven years of\nresidence.\n   By contrast to this cancellation-of-removal provision,\nsome other provisions of the immigration laws do focus only\non the offense of removal\u2014for example, provisions govern-\ning mandatory detention and jurisdiction. See \u00a7\u00a71226(a),\n(c)(1)(A), (B), 1252(a)(2)(C). But the statutory text and con-\ntext of those provisions support that limitation. Those pro-\nvisions use the phrase \u201cinadmissible by reason of \u201d a\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offense, \u201cdeportable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71227(a)(2)\noffense, or \u201cremovable by reason of \u201d a \u00a71182(a)(2) or\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense. And the provisions make contextual\nsense only if the offense justifying detention or denying ju-\nrisdiction is one of the offenses of removal. The cancellation-\nof-removal statute does not employ similar language.\n   Second, moving from overall structure to precise text,\nBarton seizes on the statutory phrase \u201ccommitted an of-\nfense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) . . . that renders the\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

According\nto Barton, conviction of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2)\u2014for\nexample, conviction in state court of a crime involving\nmoral turpitude\u2014does not itself render the noncitizen \u201cin-\nadmissible.\u201d He argues that a noncitizen is not rendered\n\u201cinadmissible\u201d unless and until the noncitizen is actually\nadjudicated as inadmissible and denied admission to the\nUnited States. And he further contends that a lawfully ad-\nmitted noncitizen usually cannot be removed from the\nUnited States on the basis of inadmissibility. As Barton\nputs it (and the dissent echoes the point), how can a law-\nfully admitted noncitizen be found inadmissible when he\nhas already been lawfully admitted?\n  As a matter of common parlance alone, that argument\nwould of course carry some force. But the argument fails\nbecause it disregards the statutory text, which employs the\nterm \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as a status that can result from, for\nexample, a noncitizen\u2019s (including a lawfully admitted\nnoncitizen\u2019s) commission of certain offenses listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2).\n  For example, as relevant here, \u00a71182(a)(2) flatly says that\na noncitizen such as Barton who commits a crime involving\nmoral turpitude and is convicted of that offense \u201cis inadmis-\nsible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). Full stop. Similarly, a noncitizen\nwho has two or more convictions, together resulting in ag-\ngregate sentences of at least five years, \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n\u00a71182(a)(2)(B). A noncitizen who a consular officer or the\nAttorney General knows or has reason to believe is a drug\ntrafficker \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(i). A noncitizen\nwho receives the proceeds of prostitution within 10 years of\napplying for admission \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2)(D)(ii).\nThe list goes on. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2)(C)(ii)\u2013(E), (G)\u2013(I).\nThose provisions do not say that a noncitizen will become\ninadmissible if the noncitizen is found inadmissible in a\nsubsequent immigration removal proceeding. Instead,\n\f14                      BARTON v. BARR\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthose provisions say that the noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d\n  Congress has in turn made that status\u2014inadmissibility\nbecause of conviction or other proof of commission of\n\u00a71182(a)(2) offenses\u2014relevant in several statutory contexts\nthat apply to lawfully admitted noncitizens such as Barton.\nThose contexts include adjustment to permanent resident\nstatus; protection from removal because of temporary pro-\ntected status; termination of temporary resident status;\nand here cancellation of removal. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C),\n(a)(3)(B)(ii), 1254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii), 1255(a), (l)(2). In\nthose contexts, the noncitizen faces immigration conse-\nquences from being convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense even\nthough the noncitizen is lawfully admitted and is not nec-\nessarily removable solely because of that offense.\n  Consider how those other proceedings work. A lawfully\nadmitted noncitizen who is convicted of an offense listed in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) is typically not removable from the United\nStates on that basis (recall that a lawfully admitted noncit-\nizen is ordinarily removable only for commission of a\n\u00a71227(a)(2) offense). But the noncitizen is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause of the \u00a71182(a)(2) offense and for that reason may\nnot be able to obtain adjustment to permanent resident sta-\ntus. \u00a7\u00a71255(a), (l)(2). So too, a lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho is convicted of an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) is \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d and for that reason may not be able to obtain tem-\nporary protected status. \u00a7\u00a71254a(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)(iii). A\nlawfully admitted noncitizen who is a temporary resident\nand is convicted of a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense is \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand for that reason may lose temporary resident status.\n\u00a7\u00a71160(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(B)(ii).\n  Those statutory examples pose a major hurdle for Bar-\nton\u2019s textual argument. The examples demonstrate that\nCongress has employed the concept of \u201cinadmissibility\u201d as\na status in a variety of statutes similar to the cancellation-\nof-removal statute, including for lawfully admitted nonciti-\nzens. Barton has no persuasive answer to those examples.\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            15\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nBarton tries to say that some of those other statutes involve\na noncitizen who, although already admitted to the United\nStates, is nonetheless seeking \u201cconstructive admission.\u201d\nReply Brief 12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But that ginned-up label\ndoes not avoid the problem. Put simply, those other stat-\nutes show that lawfully admitted noncitizens who are, for\nexample, convicted of \u00a71182(a)(2) crimes are \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nand in turn may suffer certain immigration consequences,\neven though those lawfully admitted noncitizens cannot\nnecessarily be removed solely because of those \u00a71182(a)(2)\noffenses.\n   The same is true here. A lawfully admitted noncitizen\nwho was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude dur-\ning his initial seven years of residence is \u201cinadmissible\u201d and\nfor that reason is ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n   In advancing his structural and textual arguments, Bar-\nton insists that his interpretation of the statute reflects con-\ngressional intent regarding cancellation of removal. But if\nCongress intended that only the offense of removal would\npreclude cancellation of removal under the 7-year residence\nprovision, it is unlikely that Congress would have employed\nsuch a convoluted way to express that intent. Barton can-\nnot explain why, if his view of Congress\u2019 intent is correct,\nthe statute does not simply say something like: \u201cThe alien\nis not eligible for cancellation of removal if the offense of\nremoval was committed during the alien\u2019s initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d\n   Third, on a different textual tack, Barton argues that the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation cannot be correct because the\nGovernment would treat as surplusage the phrase \u201cor re-\nmovable from the United States under section 1227(a)(2) or\n1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d Recall that the statute, as relevant\nhere, provides that a lawful permanent resident is not eli-\ngible for cancellation of removal if, during the initial seven\nyears of residence, he committed \u201can offense referred to in\n\f16                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the alien inad-\nmissible to the United States under section 1182(a)(2) of\nthis title or removable from the United States under section\n1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1)(B) (em-\nphasis added).\n   To begin with, all agree that under either side\u2019s interpre-\ntation, the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4)\u2014as distinct from\n\u00a71227(a)(2)\u2014is redundant surplusage. See \u00a71229b(c)(4);\nBrief for Petitioner 32\u201333 & n. 7. Under the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation, it is true that the reference to \u00a71227(a)(2)\nalso appears to be redundant surplusage. Any offense that\nis both referred to in \u00a71182(a)(2) and an offense that would\nrender the noncitizen deportable under \u00a71227(a)(2) would\nalso render the noncitizen inadmissible under \u00a71182(a)(2).\nBut redundancies are common in statutory drafting\u2014some-\ntimes in a congressional effort to be doubly sure, sometimes\nbecause of congressional inadvertence or lack of foresight,\nor sometimes simply because of the shortcomings of human\ncommunication. The Court has often recognized: \u201cSome-\ntimes the better overall reading of the statute contains\nsome redundancy.\u201d Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc.,\n586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11); see Wisconsin Cen-\ntral Ltd. v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op.,\nat 7); Marx v.

So it is here. Most importantly for present pur-\nposes, we do not see why the redundant statutory reference\nto \u00a71227(a)(2) should cause us to entirely rewrite \u00a71229b so\nthat a noncitizen\u2019s commission of an offense referred to in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) would preclude cancellation of removal only if it\nis also the offense of removal. Redundancy in one portion\nof a statute is not a license to rewrite or eviscerate another\nportion of the statute contrary to its text, as Barton would\nhave us do.\n   One final point: Barton argues in the alternative that\neven if inadmissibility is a status, and even if the offense\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat precludes cancellation of removal need not be one of\nthe offenses of removal, the noncitizen must at least have\nbeen capable of being charged with a \u00a71182(a)(2) inadmis-\nsibility offense as the basis for removal. The dissent seizes\non this argument as well. But as we have explained, this\ncancellation-of-removal statute is a recidivist statute that\nprecludes cancellation of removal if the noncitizen has com-\nmitted an offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial\nseven years of residence. Whether the offense that pre-\ncludes cancellation of removal was charged or could have\nbeen charged as one of the offenses of removal is irrelevant\nto that analysis.\n                         *     *    *\n   Removal of a lawful permanent resident from the United\nStates is a wrenching process, especially in light of the con-\nsequences for family members. Removal is particularly dif-\nficult when it involves someone such as Barton who has\nspent most of his life in the United States. Congress made\na choice, however, to authorize removal of noncitizens\u2014\neven lawful permanent residents\u2014who have committed\ncertain serious crimes. And Congress also made a choice to\ncategorically preclude cancellation of removal for nonciti-\nzens who have substantial criminal records. Congress may\nof course amend the law at any time. In the meantime, the\nCourt is constrained to apply the law as enacted by Con-\ngress. Here, as the BIA explained in its 2006 Jurado-\nDelgado decision, and as the Second, Third, Fifth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits have indicated, the immigration laws enacted\nby Congress do not allow cancellation of removal when a\nlawful permanent resident has amassed a criminal record\nof this kind.\n   We affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

But to trigger the rule, it takes more than\ncommission of a specified criminal offense: The offense\nmust also render a noncitizen either \u201cinadmissible\u201d or \u201cde-\nportable.\u201d In applying these important limitations, the rule\ndirectly references the two-track nature of the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), a statute that has long distin-\nguished between noncitizens seeking admission and those\nalready admitted. Inadmissibility, of course, pertains to\nnoncitizens seeking admission; deportability relates to\nnoncitizens already admitted but removable.\n  The majority errs by conflating these two terms. It con-\ncludes that the term \u201cinadmissible,\u201d for the purposes of the\nstop-time rule, refers to a status that a noncitizen could ac-\nquire even if he or she is not seeking admission. Under this\nlogic, petitioner Andre Barton is inadmissible yet, at the\nsame time, lawfully admitted. Neither the express lan-\nguage of the statute nor any interpretative canons support\nthis paradox; Barton cannot and should not be considered\ninadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule because he\nhas already been admitted to the country. Thus, for the\n\f2                         BARTON v.

To obtain this relief, both\ngroups must continuously reside in the United States for a\ncertain amount of time. \u00a71229b(a)(2) (seven years for\nLPRs); \u00a71229b(b)(1)(A) (10 years for non-LPR noncitizens).\n  The stop-time rule ends a noncitizen\u2019s period of continu-\nous residence (1) when the noncitizen \u201chas committed an\noffense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d that\neither (2) \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible to the\nUnited States under section 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or (3)\nrenders the noncitizen \u201cremovable from the United States\nunder section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(d)(1). The second clause directly invokes grounds of\ninadmissibility; the third clause, although using the term\n\u201cremovable,\u201d directly invokes grounds of deportability. See\n\u00a71227(a) (specifying \u201c[c]lasses of deportable aliens\u201d).1 Both\nthe second and the third clauses are cabined by the first: In\naddition to rendering a noncitizen either inadmissible or\ndeportable, the offense must also be one \u201creferred to\u201d in\n\u00a71182(a)(2). That provision includes some\u2014but not all\u2014of\nthe grounds of deportability in \u00a71227.\n  This distinction between \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d\nmatters.

IIRIRA also altered when a noncitizen faces\ngrounds of inadmissibility, formerly exclusion: Rather than\nfocusing on whether a noncitizen had physically entered the\ncountry, the statute now asks whether the noncitizen had\nbeen lawfully admitted, in any status, to the country. See\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(13)(A), 1182(a).\n  Still, the immigration laws have retained their two-track\nstructure. Inadmissibility and deportability remain sepa-\nrate concepts, triggered by different grounds. With few ex-\nceptions, the grounds for inadmissibility are broader than\nthose for deportability. Compare \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) with\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i) (reflecting different treatment for crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude). Further, while a noncitizen\n\f4                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncharged with inadmissibility bears the ultimate burden to\nshow that he is admissible, the Government bears the bur-\nden of demonstrating that a noncitizen is deportable.\n\u00a7\u00a71229a(c)(2), (c)(3).\n   Whether a noncitizen is charged with inadmissibility or\ndeportability also affects what the noncitizen or the Gov-\nernment must show to carry their respective burdens. A\ncriminal ground for inadmissibility can be made out by\nshowing either that the noncitizen admitted to conduct\nmeeting the elements of a crime or that she was actually\nconvicted of an offense. See, e.g., Pazcoguin v. Radcliffe,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777938\"><a href=\"/opinion/777938/nathaniel-flores-pazcoguin-v-donald-a-radcliffe-district-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1213\u20131215 (CA9 2002) (noncitizen inadmis-\nsible because he admitted to health officer that he smoked\nmarijuana in his youth); see also \u00a71182(a)(2)(A). By con-\ntrast, most criminal grounds for deportability can be estab-\nlished only through convictions. See \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(v),\n(a)(2)(B)(i).\n   Finally, the substantive standards for cancellation of re-\nmoval are also less stringent for a subset of deportable\nnoncitizens: LPRs like Barton. Among other things, while\nan otherwise-eligible LPR must merely demonstrate that\nhe or she deserves the relief as a matter of discretion, see\nIn re C-V-T-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7, 10\u201311 (BIA 1998), non-LPRs\nmust demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual\nhardship to an LPR or citizen parent, spouse, or child,\n\u00a71229b(b)(1)(D).\n   These separate categories and procedures\u2014treating de-\nportable noncitizens more generously than inadmissible\nnoncitizens, and treating one group of deportable nonciti-\nzens (LPRs) the most generously of all\u2014stem from one an-\nimating principle. All noncitizens in this country are enti-\ntled to certain rights and protections, but the protections\nafforded to previously admitted noncitizens and LPRs are\nparticularly strong. See Demore v.

The\nrule specifies how a period of continuous residence ends for\nnoncitizens who are seeking admission and thus are inad-\nmissible, as well as noncitizens who are already admitted\nand thus are deportable. By using separate terms and\ngrounds for two groups of people, the stop-time rule thus\nreflects the two-track dichotomy for inadmissible or deport-\nable noncitizens that pervades the INA.\n                               B\n  Barton is a longtime lawfully admitted resident of the\nUnited States. He and his mother moved to the United\nStates from Jamaica when he was about 10 years old. They\nboth entered legally and, through Barton\u2019s stepfather, soon\nadjusted their status to LPRs. When Barton was placed in\nremoval proceedings, all of his immediate family\u2014his\nmother, his children, his fiancee\u2014were living in the United\nStates. He had not returned to Jamaica in 25 years.\n  Barton was first arrested in 1996, when he was 17 or 18,\nafter a friend shot at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house while he was\npresent. Both he and his friend were convicted of, among\nother things, aggravated assault and possession of a fire-\narm. Barton later testified before an immigration judge\nthat he was unaware that his friend had a gun or was plan-\nning to shoot it.\n  After attending a boot camp and obtaining his GED, Bar-\nton led a law-abiding life for several years. But in the mid-\n\f6                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n2000s, Barton developed a drug problem and was convicted\ntwice on possession charges. After attending two drug re-\nhabilitation programs, Barton was never arrested again.\nHe graduated from college, began running an automobile\nrepair shop, and became a father to four young children.\n  Just a few years ago\u2014nearly 10 years after his last ar-\nrest\u2014the Government detained Barton and placed him in\nremoval proceedings. Because he had been lawfully admit-\nted to the country, the Government could not charge him\nwith any grounds of inadmissibility. Rather, the Govern-\nment charged, and Barton conceded, that he was deportable\nbased on prior firearms and drug convictions. (All agree\nthat Barton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense did not qualify as\na deportable offense under \u00a71227.) Barton then sought can-\ncellation of removal.\n  Perhaps recognizing that Barton had a strong case for\ncancellation of removal on the merits, see C-V-T-, 22 I. & N.\nDec., at 11 (factors such as \u201cfamily ties within the United\nStates, residence of long duration in this country (particu-\nlarly when the inception of residence occurred at a young\nage),\u201d and \u201cbusiness ties\u201d all favor a noncitizen seeking can-\ncellation), the Government contended that Barton was cat-\negorically ineligible for that relief. It reasoned that Bar-\nton\u2019s prior offenses triggered the stop-time rule and that\nBarton therefore could not meet the continuous-residence\nrequirement.\n  The problem (for the Government) was finding a prior of-\nfense that actually triggered the stop-time rule. None of the\noffenses that had made Barton deportable\u2014his firearms\nand drug convictions\u2014satisfied the stop-time rule\u2019s first\nclause because \u00a71182(a)(2) does not \u201crefe[r] to\u201d those of-\nfenses. The Government therefore could not argue that\nBarton\u2019s firearms and drug offenses ended Barton\u2019s period\nof continuous residence under the stop-time rule. As for\nBarton\u2019s aggravated-assault offense, it was not a ground for\ndeportability under \u00a71227(a) and therefore did not render\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

That is, although the Government could\nnot charge Barton with inadmissibility, it relied upon a\nground of inadmissibility to assert that Barton was not en-\ntitled to relief from removal.\n   The Immigration Judge agreed with the Government.\nThe judge made clear, however, that she would have\ngranted Barton\u2019s cancellation application had he satisfied\nthe continuous-residence requirement. The judge cited,\namong other things, Barton\u2019s strong family ties, including\nhis four young children who were all U. S. citizens. The\njudge concluded that because \u201chis last arrest was over 10\nyears ago,\u201d Barton \u201cis clearly rehabilitated.\u201d The judge also\nconcluded that Barton\u2019s family \u201crelies on him and would\nsuffer hardship if he were to be deported to Jamaica.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 36a.\n                             II\n  Barton makes two arguments to this Court. The Court\nfocuses on the first\u2014that the stop-time rule will \u201crende[r]\u201d\na noncitizen inadmissible only if the person is actually ad-\njudicated inadmissible based on the given offense. But\nwhether Barton is right on that score is irrelevant because\nBarton\u2019s second argument\u2014which the Court fails to grap-\nple with meaningfully\u2014is surely correct: At the very least,\nan offense cannot \u201crende[r]\u201d someone inadmissible unless\nthe Government can legally charge that noncitizen with a\nground of inadmissibility. That is, the stop-time rule is con-\nsistent with basic immigration law: A noncitizen who has\nalready been admitted, and is not seeking readmission, can-\nnot be charged with any ground of inadmissibility and thus\ncannot be deemed inadmissible.\n\f8                           BARTON v. BARR\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Because the stop-time rule uses the terms \u201cremovable\u201d\n(i.e., deportable) and \u201cinadmissible\u201d in the disjunctive, the\nCourt must analyze the rule against the INA\u2019s historic two-\ntrack backdrop. That context confirms that the term \u201cinad-\nmissible\u201d cannot refer to a noncitizen who, like Barton, has\nalready been admitted and is not seeking readmission. In-\ndeed, the terms \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d are mutu-\nally exclusive in removal proceedings: A noncitizen can be\ndeemed either inadmissible or deportable, not both.\n\u00a71229a(e) (for the purposes of removal statute and\n\u00a71229b\u2014governing cancellation of removal\u2014a noncitizen is\n\u201cinadmissible under section 1182\u201d if \u201cnot admitted to the\nUnited States,\u201d and \u201cdeportable under section 1227\u201d if \u201cad-\nmitted to the United States\u201d). For the purposes of the stop-\ntime rule, a person is not \u201cinadmissible\u201d unless that person\nactually seeks admission, and thus is subject to charges of\ninadmissibility.\n   After all, if the provision applied to those who could hy-\npothetically be rendered inadmissible, it could have said so.\nFor example, the statute would have said that it applied\nwhen \u201cthe alien has committed an offense referred to in sec-\ntion 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d that either (2) \u201ccould render the\nalien inadmissible to the United States under section\n1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or (3) could render the noncitizen\n\u201cremovable [i.e., deportable] from the United States under\nsection 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this title.\u201d2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court seems to suggest that the stop-time rule\u2019s tense simply\n\nmirrors \u00a71182(a)(2). See ante, at 13\u201314. It is true that \u00a71182(a)(2)\nspeaks in the present tense, stating that a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible\u201d if\nshe has been \u201cconvicted of \u201d or \u201cadmits having committed\u201d certain of-\nfenses. \u00a71182(a)(2)(A)(i). But the Court\u2019s argument does not follow. Sec-\ntion 1182, by its terms, applies only to \u201c[c]lasses of aliens ineligible for\nvisas or admission.\u201d \u00a71182(a). Because the provision applies only to\nnoncitizens seeking admission, it is only natural that the clause uses the\npresent tense to describe when such a noncitizen \u201cis inadmissible.\u201d By\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

These pro-\nvisions, it argues, demonstrate that throughout the INA,\ninadmissibility is a status untethered to admission. But\nthese provisions, too, refer to noncitizens seeking adjust-\nment of status. \u00a71160(a)(1) (setting procedures for adjust-\nment of status of certain noncitizens); \u00a71255a(a) (same).3\nEven if the Government were correct that these statutes\ndeem a noncitizen inadmissible outside of an application for\nadmission, its argument would rise and fall on a few provi-\nsions within the expansive INA.4 In any event, neither of\nthese provisions is similar in structure and purpose to the\nstop-time rule. Neither refers to grounds of inadmissibility\nand grounds of deportability in tandem. What is more, nei-\nther appears to confer or deny relief exclusively in removal\nproceedings\u2014where the dichotomy between inadmissibility\nand deportability is most important.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Indeed, one of the provisions suggests that, outside the context in\n\nwhich a noncitizen seeks adjustment of status (and thus seeks construc-\ntive admission), a noncitizen\u2019s status can be terminated \u201conly upon a de-\ntermination . . . that the alien is deportable.\u201d \u00a71160(a)(3)(A).\n   4 The Government also notes that a noncitizen would be deportable\n\nwere she inadmissible at entry (or during adjustment of status) but er-\nroneously admitted (or allowed to adjust status). Brief for Respondent\n18\u201319 (citing \u00a71227(a)(1)(A)). But this provision directly undermines the\nGovernment\u2019s reading of the statute. Were inadmissibility a status un-\ntethered to admission, a noncitizen inadmissible at the time of entry\nwould always be inadmissible. But because a noncitizen who was al-\nready admitted cannot be adjudicated inadmissible, Congress made er-\nroneous admission a ground of deportability, not inadmissibility.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            11\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   By contrast, the Government concedes that the term \u201cin-\nadmissible\u201d in the mandatory-detention statute\u2014a provi-\nsion structurally similar to the stop-time rule\u2014applies only\nto noncitizens capable of being charged with inadmissibil-\nity. Brief for Respondent 30. That provision specifies, in\nrelevant part, that the Government \u201cshall take into custody\nany alien who\u2014(A) is inadmissible by reason of having com-\nmitted any offense covered in section 1182(a)(2)\u201d or \u201c(C) is\ndeportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) . . . on the basis of\nan offense for which the alien has been sentence[d] to a\nterm of imprisonment of at least 1 year.\u201d \u00a71226(c)(1) (foot-\nnote omitted).\n   Although the term \u201cinadmissible\u201d in this context does not\nrefer to an actual adjudication of inadmissibility, see\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127916\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Demore,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/127916/demore-v-kim/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>, at <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531, the Government accepts\nthat it must at least refer to a possible charge on a nonciti-\nzen seeking admission. Brief for Respondent 30. Other-\nwise, the statute would subject already-admitted nonciti-\nzens\u2014even those who are not deportable for any criminal\noffense\u2014to mandatory detention, simply because they oc-\ncupy the \u201cstatus\u201d of inadmissibility. This provision\u2019s struc-\nture is virtually the same as the stop-time rule: It refers to\ngrounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportability sep-\narately and applies to a noncitizen in removal proceedings.\n   Given the similar structure, the stop-time rule should be\nread the same as the mandatory-detention provision: to re-\nfer to adjudications that are possible rather than impossi-\nble. If a noncitizen seeking admission has committed a\ncrime under \u00a71182(a)(2) and is convicted of or admits to the\noffense, that offense \u201crenders\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissible\u201d\nbecause the noncitizen can be charged and found inadmis-\nsible based on that crime. But such an offense does not ren-\nder a noncitizen inadmissible if, like Barton, he or she was\nadmitted years earlier and does not seek readmission. For\na noncitizen who has already been admitted, Congress\ncarved out a separate category of offenses in both the stop-\n\f12                    BARTON v.

At various points the Court\nseems to ignore the rule\u2019s second and third clauses en-\ntirely\u2014clauses that, as mentioned above, distinguish be-\ntween grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportabil-\nity. The Court insists that the statute \u201coperates like\ntraditional criminal recidivist laws\u201d because it precludes\ncancellation of removal for a noncitizen who \u201chas committed\nan offense listed in \u00a71182(a)(2) during the initial seven\nyears of residence.\u201d Ante, at 2; see also ante, at 7, 8, n. 5,\n17.\n   Had Congress intended for commission of a crime in\n\u00a71182(a)(2) alone to trigger the stop-time rule, it would\nhave said so. In fact, it would have stopped at the rule\u2019s\nfirst clause, which (without more) states the Court\u2019s rule:\nthat the time of continuous residence stops whenever a\nnoncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in section\n1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1).\n   But that reading ignores the rest of what Congress wrote.\nCongress specified that it is not enough for a noncitizen to\ncommit a crime listed in \u00a71182(a)(2); that crime must also\n\u201crende[r] the alien inadmissible to the United States under\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title\u201d or \u201cremovable from the\nUnited States under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4) of this\ntitle.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1). Those words have meaning\u2014invoking\nthe two-track structure of the INA and the distinction be-\ntween grounds of inadmissibility and grounds of deportabil-\nity\u2014and the Court cannot simply will them out of existence.\n   Even when the Court finally discusses the second clause,\n\u201crenders the alien inadmissible,\u201d the Court raises more\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                    13\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nquestions than it answers\u2014and answers questions that it\nneed not address at all. First, the Court claims, the clause\nmakes clear that \u201ccancellation of removal is precluded if an\nalien committed a \u00a71182(a)(2) offense during the initial\nseven years of residence, even if (as in Barton\u2019s case) the\nconviction occurred after the seven years elapsed.\u201d Ante, at\n9. Despite the emphasis the Court lays on this point, it is\nirrelevant to this case: Barton does not dispute that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by the date of commission of a\ncrime rather than a later date of conviction. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 9, n. 4. The question in this case is whether certain\noffenses can possibly render Barton inadmissible when he\ndoes not seek admission and has already been admitted\u2014\nregardless of whether one looks to the date of commission\nor the date of conviction of those offenses.5\n   Even if this question mattered and were properly before\nus, Congress could have made the same point\u2014that the\nstop-time rule is triggered by commission of a crime\u2014by\nomitting the second and third clauses entirely. It again\ncould have written what the Court, at various points, seems\nto wish it had written: The stop-time rule is triggered when-\never a noncitizen \u201chas committed an offense referred to in\nsection 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d The second and third\nclauses\u2014which refer to later events, when a noncitizen is\nactually \u201crender[ed]\u201d inadmissible or deportable\u2014make the\nCourt\u2019s aside less plausible, not more.\n   The Court next insists that the second clause makes clear\nthat the crime must \u201crende[r]\u201d the noncitizen \u201cinadmissi-\nble\u201d\u2014which, in the Court\u2019s view, requires only that a\nnoncitizen admit the crime or be convicted of it. Ante, at 10.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Courts have split over what event triggers the stop-time rule\u2014com-\n\nmission of the offense or a second, later point at which the offense \u201cren-\nder[s]\u201d the noncitizen inadmissible. Brief for Momodoulamin Jobe et al.\nas Amici Curiae 12\u201313. Because this point about the trigger date is nei-\nther disputed here nor briefed by either party, the Court\u2019s opinion should\nnot be read to resolve a Circuit split that is not before this Court.\n\f14                     BARTON v. BARR\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nBut given the INA\u2019s historic two-track structure, a nonciti-\nzen is not \u201crender[ed]\u201d inadmissible when convicted of an\noffense that cannot serve as a ground of removal at all. The\nCourt also fails to clarify why, if conviction or admission\nalone renders any noncitizen inadmissible regardless of ad-\nmission status, Congress chose to add a third clause refer-\nring to grounds of deportability.\n  Indeed, what does the Court do about the canon against\nsurplusage? The Court does not dispute that its reading\nmakes the entire third clause of the stop-time rule mean-\ningless. It offers only two rejoinders: (1) that the reference\nto subsection (a)(4) in the third clause is superfluous under\neither party\u2019s reading, and (2) that a bit of surplusage\nmakes no difference in any event. Ante, at 15\u201316. To be\nsure, \u201c[s]ometimes the better overall reading of the statute\ncontains some redundancy.\u201d Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle\nUSA, Inc., 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11). But the\nCourt relies on more than just \u201csome redundancy.\u201d It dis-\nmisses out of hand one of only three clauses in the stop-time\nrule\u2014without regard for the clause\u2019s pedigree or the core\ndifference between deportability and inadmissibility.\n  It remains this Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018duty \u201cto give effect, if possible,\nto every clause and word of a statute.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Duncan v.

It is also at odds with common sense. With virtually\nevery other provision of the INA, Congress granted prefer-\nential treatment to lawfully admitted noncitizens\u2014and\nmost of all to LPRs like Barton. But because of the Court\u2019s\nopinion today, noncitizens who were already admitted to\nthe country are treated, for the purposes of the stop-time\nrule, identically to those who were not\u2014despite Congress\u2019\nexpress references to inadmissibility and deportability.\nThe result is that, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, an im-\nmigration judge may not even consider whether Barton is\nentitled to cancellation of removal\u2014because of an offense\nthat Congress deemed too trivial to allow for Barton\u2019s re-\nmoval in the first instance. Because the Court\u2019s opinion\ndoes no justice to the INA, let alone to longtime LPRs like\nBarton, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Barton acknowledges that, even now, the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4)\n\n\u201cdoes little or no work\u201d for a separate reason: Noncitizens who are de-\nportable under that subsection are ineligible for cancellation of removal.\nBrief for Petitioner 33, n. 7. But, according to Barton, there are scenarios\nin which the reference to \u00a71227(a)(4) nevertheless \u201c \u2018may . . . not be a re-\ndundancy,\u2019 \u201d ibid., and perhaps for this reason, the Government does not\nfocus on this argument in its brief.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145888/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1269282/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/105289/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/127916/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/618680/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/777938/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118452/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/96405/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/131159/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/104952/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2462772/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4528127/", "id": 4528127, "absolute_url": "/opinion/4747780/county-of-maui-v-hawaii-wildlife-fund/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/4747780/", "author": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/people/384/", "joined_by": [], "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "date_created": "2020-04-23T15:01:03.577726Z", "date_modified": "2020-04-23T15:07:46.643088Z", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "692fdcbd3dd61459c15be3e7a906963341a63c24", "page_count": 51, "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-260_i4dk.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2020/04/23/county_of_maui_v._hawaii_wildlife_fund.pdf", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2019                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 6, 2019\u2014Decided April 23, 2020\nThe Clean Water Act forbids \u201cany addition\u201d of any pollutant from \u201cany\n  point source\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d without an appropriate permit\n  from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 502(12),\n  86 Stat. 844, 886. The Act defines \u201cpollutant\u201d broadly, \u00a7502(6); defines\n  a \u201cpoint source\u201d as \u201c \u2018any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance\n  . . . from which pollutants are or may be discharged,\u2019 \u201d including, e.g.,\n  any \u201c \u2018container,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018well,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(14); and defines the term \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d as \u201c \u2018any ad-\n  dition of any pollutant to navigable waters [including navigable\n  streams, rivers, the ocean, or coastal waters] from any point source,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(12). It then uses those terms in making \u201cunlawful\u201d \u201c \u2018the dis-\n  charge of any pollutant by any person\u2019 \u201d without an appropriate permit.\n  \u00a7301.\n      Petitioner County of Maui\u2019s wastewater reclamation facility collects\n  sewage from the surrounding area, partially treats it, and each day\n  pumps around 4 million gallons of treated water into the ground\n  through four wells. This effluent then travels about a half mile,\n  through groundwater, to the Pacific Ocean. Respondent environmen-\n  tal groups brought a citizens\u2019 Clean Water Act suit, alleging that Maui\n  was \u201cdischarg[ing]\u201d a \u201cpollutant\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d without the re-\n  quired permit. The District Court found that the discharge from\n  Maui\u2019s wells into the nearby groundwater was \u201cfunctionally one into\n  navigable water,\u201d 24 F. Supp. 3d 980, 998, and granted summary judg-\n  ment to the environmental groups. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, stat-\n  ing that a permit is required when \u201cpollutants are fairly traceable from\n  the point source to a navigable water.\u201d 886 F. 3d 737, 749.\nHeld: The statutory provisions at issue require a permit when there is a\n\f2           COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    direct discharge from a point source into navigable waters or when\n    there is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Pp. 4\u201318.\n       (a) Statutory context limits the reach of the phrase \u201cfrom any point\n    source\u201d to a range of circumstances narrower than that which the\n    Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d interpretation suggests. At the same\n    time, it is significantly broader than the total exclusion of all dis-\n    charges through groundwater, as urged by Maui and by the Solicitor\n    General as amicus curiae. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d limitation could allow EPA\n    to assert permitting authority over the release of pollutants that reach\n    navigable waters many years after their release. But Congress did not\n    intend to provide EPA with such broad authority. First, to interpret\n    \u201cfrom\u201d so broadly might require a permit in unexpected circumstances,\n    such as, e.g., the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250 miles of\n    groundwater to a river. Second, the statute\u2019s structure indicates that,\n    as to groundwater pollution and nonpoint source pollution, Congress\n    left substantial responsibility and autonomy to the States and did not\n    give EPA authority that could seriously interfere with this state re-\n    sponsibility. Third, the Act\u2019s legislative history strongly supports the\n    conclusion that the permitting provision does not extend so far. Fi-\n    nally, longstanding regulatory practice shows that EPA has success-\n    fully applied the permitting provision to pollution discharges from\n    point sources that reached navigable waters through groundwater\n    using a narrower interpretation than that of the Ninth Circuit. Pp. 5\u2013\n    10.\n       (c) Maui, the Government, and the two dissents argue for interpre-\n    tations that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purposes,\n    are also too extreme. Pp. 10\u201315.\n          (1) Maui and the Solicitor General argue that the statute\u2019s per-\n    mitting requirement does not apply if a pollutant, having emerged\n    from a \u201cpoint source,\u201d must travel through any amount of groundwater\n    before reaching navigable waters. That narrow interpretation would\n    risk serious interference with EPA\u2019s ability to regulate point source\n    discharges, and Congress would not have intended to create such a\n    large and obvious loophole in one of the Clean Water Act\u2019s key regula-\n    tory innovations. P. 10.\n          (2) Reading \u201cfrom\u201d in the phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d together\n    with \u201cconveyance\u201d in the point source definition \u201cany . . . conveyance,\u201d\n    Maui argues that the meaning of \u201cfrom any point source\u201d is not about\n    where the pollution originated, but about how it got there. Thus, Maui\n    claims, a permit is required only if a point source ultimately delivers\n    the pollutant to navigable waters. By contrast, if a pollutant travels\n    through groundwater, then the groundwater is the conveyance and no\n    permit is required. But Maui\u2019s definition of \u201cfrom\u201d as connoting a\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

Coupling \u201cfrom\u201d with \u201cto\u201d is strong evi-\ndence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnavigable wa-\nters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d). That Maui\u2019s reading would\ncreate a serious loophole in the permitting regime also indicates that\nit is unreasonable. Pp. 10\u201311.\n      (3) The Solicitor General argues that the proper interpretation of\nthe statute is the one reflected in EPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement,\nnamely, that \u201call releases of pollutants to groundwater\u201d are excluded\nfrom the scope of the permitting program, \u201ceven where pollutants are\nconveyed to jurisdictional surface waters via groundwater.\u201d 84 Fed.\nReg. 16810, 16811. That reading, which would open a loophole allow-\ning easy evasion of the statutory provision\u2019s basic purposes, is neither\npersuasive nor reasonable. EPA is correct that Congress did not re-\nquire a permit for all discharges to groundwater, and it did authorize\nstudy and funding related to groundwater pollution. But the most that\nthe study and funding provisions show is that Congress thought that\nthe problem of pollution in groundwater would primarily be addressed\nby the States or perhaps by other federal statutes. EPA\u2019s new inter-\npretation is also difficult to reconcile with the statute\u2019s reference to\n\u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable waters; with the statute\u2019s\ninclusion of \u201cwells\u201d in the \u201cpoint source\u201d definition, since wells would\nordinarily discharge pollutants through groundwater; and with statu-\ntory provisions that allow EPA to delegate its permitting authority to\na State only if the State, inter alia, provides \u201c \u2018adequate authority\u2019 \u201d to\n\u201c \u2018control the disposal of pollutants into wells,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7402(b). Pp. 11\u201313.\n      (4) Perhaps, as the dissents suggest, the statute\u2019s language could\nbe narrowed by reading the statute to refer only to the pollutant\u2019s im-\nmediate origin, but there is no linguistic basis for this limitation.\nPp. 13\u201315.\n    (d) The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim to provide federal\nregulation of identifiable sources of pollutants entering navigable wa-\nters without undermining the States\u2019 longstanding regulatory author-\nity over land and groundwater. The reading of the statute that best\ncaptures Congress\u2019 meaning, reflected in the statute\u2019s words, struc-\nture, and purposes, is that a permit is required when there is a dis-\ncharge from a point source directly into navigable waters or when\nthere is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Many factors\nmay be relevant to determining whether a particular discharge is the\nfunctional equivalent of one directly into navigable waters. Time and\ndistance will be the most important factors in most cases, but other\nrelevant factors may include, e.g., the nature of the material through\nwhich the pollutant travels and the extent to which the pollutant is\ndiluted or chemically changed as it travels. Courts will provide addi-\ntional guidance through decisions in individual cases. The underlying\n\f4           COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Although this interpretation does not pre-\n    sent as clear a line as the other interpretations proffered, the EPA has\n    applied the permitting provision to some discharges through ground-\n    water for over 30 years, with no evidence of inadministrability or an\n    unmanageable expansion in the statute\u2019s scope.

We conclude that the statutory provisions at\nissue require a permit if the addition of the pollutants\nthrough groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct\ndischarge from the point source into navigable waters.\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                  I\n                                 A\n    Congress\u2019 purpose as reflected in the language of the\nClean Water Act is to \u201c \u2018restore and maintain the . . . integ-\nrity of the Nation\u2019s waters,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7101(a), 86 Stat. 816. Prior to\nthe Act, Federal and State Governments regulated water\npollution in large part by setting water quality standards.\nSee EPA v. California ex rel. State Water Resources Control\nBd., 426 U. S. 200, 202\u2013203 (1976). The Act restructures\nfederal regulation by insisting that a person wishing to dis-\ncharge any pollution into navigable waters first obtain\nEPA\u2019s permission to do so. See id., at 203\u2013205; Milwaukee\nv. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 310\u2013311 (1981).\n    The Act\u2019s provisions use specific definitional language to\nachieve this result. First, the Act defines \u201cpollutant\u201d\nbroadly, including in its definition, for example, any solid\nwaste, incinerator residue, \u201c \u2018heat,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018discarded equip-\nment,\u2019 \u201d or sand (among many other things). \u00a7502(6), 86\nStat. 886. Second, the Act defines a \u201cpoint source\u201d as \u201c \u2018any\ndiscernible, confined and discrete conveyance . . . from\nwhich pollutants are or may be discharged,\u2019 \u201d including, for\nexample, any \u201c \u2018container,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel,\nconduit,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018well.\u2019 \u201d \u00a7502(14), id., at 887. Third, it defines\nthe term \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d as \u201c \u2018any addition of any\npollutant to navigable waters [including navigable streams,\nrivers, the ocean, or coastal waters] from any point source.\u2019 \u201d\n\u00a7502(12), id., at 886.\n    The Act then sets forth a statutory provision that, using\nthese terms, broadly states that (with certain exceptions)\n\u201c \u2018the discharge of any pollutant by any person\u2019 \u201d without an\nappropriate permit \u201c \u2018shall be unlawful.\u2019 \u201d \u00a7301, id., at 844.\nThe question here, as we have said, is whether, or how, this\nstatutory language applies to a pollutant that reaches nav-\nigable waters only after it leaves a \u201cpoint source\u201d and then\ntravels through groundwater before reaching navigable wa-\nters. In such an instance, has there been a \u201cdischarge of a\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

The facility collects sewage from the surrounding\narea, partially treats it, and pumps the treated water\nthrough four wells hundreds of feet underground. This ef-\nfluent, amounting to about 4 million gallons each day, then\ntravels a further half mile or so, through groundwater, to\nthe ocean.\n   In 2012, several environmental groups, the respondents\nhere, brought this citizens\u2019 Clean Water Act lawsuit against\nMaui. See \u00a7505(a), id., at 888. They claimed that Maui was\n\u201cdischarg[ing]\u201d a \u201cpollutant\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d namely,\nthe Pacific Ocean, without the permit required by the Clean\nWater Act. The District Court, relying in part upon a de-\ntailed study of the discharges, found that a considerable\namount of effluent from the wells ended up in the ocean (a\nnavigable water). It wrote that, because the \u201cpath to the\nocean is clearly ascertainable,\u201d the discharge from Maui\u2019s\nwells into the nearby groundwater was \u201cfunctionally one\ninto navigable water.\u201d 24 F. Supp. 3d 980, 998 (Haw. 2014).\nAnd it granted summary judgment in favor of the environ-\nmental groups. See id., at 1005.\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court, but it de-\nscribed the relevant statutory standard somewhat differ-\nently. The appeals court wrote that a permit is required\nwhen \u201cthe pollutants are fairly traceable from the point\nsource to a navigable water such that the discharge is the\nfunctional equivalent of a discharge into the navigable wa-\nter.\u201d 886 F. 3d 737, 749 (2018) (emphasis added). The court\nleft \u201cfor another day the task of determining when, if ever,\nthe connection between a point source and a navigable wa-\nter is too tenuous to support liability . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n\f4        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Maui petitioned for certiorari. In light of the differences\nin the standards adopted by the different Courts of Appeals,\nwe granted the petition. Compare, e.g., 886 F. 3d, at 749\n(\u201cfairly traceable\u201d), with Upstate Forever v. Kinder Morgan\nEnergy Partners, L. P., 887 F. 3d 637, 651 (CA4 2018) (\u201cdi-\nrect hydrological connection\u201d), and Kentucky Waterways Al-\nliance v. Kentucky Util. Co., 905 F. 3d 925, 932\u2013938 (CA6\n2018) (discharges through groundwater are excluded from\nthe Act\u2019s permitting requirements).\n                               II\n   The linguistic question here concerns the statutory word\n\u201cfrom.\u201d Is pollution that reaches navigable waters only\nthrough groundwater pollution that is \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource, as the statute uses the word? The word \u201cfrom\u201d is\nbroad in scope, but context often imposes limitations. \u201cFin-\nland,\u201d for example, is often not the right kind of answer to\nthe question, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d even if long ago\nyou were born there.\n   The parties here disagree dramatically about the scope of\nthe word \u201cfrom\u201d in the present context. The environmental\ngroups, the respondents, basically adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nview\u2014that the permitting requirement applies so long as\nthe pollutant is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to a point source even if it\ntraveled long and far (through groundwater) before it\nreached navigable waters. They add that the release from\nthe point source must be \u201ca proximate cause of the addition\nof pollutants to navigable waters.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n20.\n   Maui, on the other hand, argues that the statute creates\na \u201cbright-line test.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 27\u201328. A point\nsource or series of point sources must be \u201cthe means of de-\nlivering pollutants to navigable waters.\u201d Id., at 28.

S. ____ (2020)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsource and the navigable water,\u201d then the permit require-\nment \u201cdoes not apply.\u201d Id., at 54. A pollutant is \u201cfrom\u201d a\npoint source only if a point source is the last \u201cconveyance\u201d\nthat conducted the pollutant to navigable waters.\n  The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, supports Maui,\nat least in respect to groundwater. Reiterating the position\ntaken in a recent EPA \u201cInterpretive Statement,\u201d see 84 Fed.\nReg. 16810 (2019), he argues that, given the Act\u2019s structure\nand history, \u201ca release of pollutants to groundwater is not\nsubject to\u201d the Act\u2019s permitting requirement \u201ceven if the\npollutants subsequently migrate to jurisdictional surface\nwaters,\u201d such as the ocean. Brief for United States as Ami-\ncus Curiae 12 (capitalization omitted).\n  We agree that statutory context limits the reach of the\nstatutory phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d to a range of cir-\ncumstances narrower than that which the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation suggests. At the same time, it is signifi-\ncantly broader than the total exclusion of all discharges\nthrough groundwater described by Maui and the Solicitor\nGeneral.\n                              III\n   Virtually all water, polluted or not, eventually makes its\nway to navigable water. This is just as true for groundwa-\nter. See generally 2 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Encyclopedia\n2600 (10th ed. 2008) (defining \u201cHydrology\u201d). Given the\npower of modern science, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s limitation,\n\u201cfairly traceable,\u201d may well allow EPA to assert permitting\nauthority over the release of pollutants that reach naviga-\nble waters many years after their release (say, from a well\nor pipe or compost heap) and in highly diluted forms. See,\ne.g., Brief for Aquatic Scientists et al. as Amici Curiae\n13\u201328.\n   The respondents suggest that the standard can be nar-\nrowed by adding a \u201cproximate cause\u201d requirement. That is,\nto fall within the permitting provision, the discharge from\n\f6       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na point source must \u201cproximately cause\u201d the pollutants\u2019\neventual addition to navigable waters. But the term \u201cprox-\nimate cause\u201d derives from general tort law, and it takes on\nits specific content based primarily on \u201cpolicy\u201d considera-\ntions. See CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U. S. 685, 701\n(2011) (plurality opinion). In the context of water pollution,\nwe do not see how it significantly narrows the statute be-\nyond the words \u201cfairly traceable\u201d themselves.\n   Our view is that Congress did not intend the point source-\npermitting requirement to provide EPA with such broad au-\nthority as the Ninth Circuit\u2019s narrow focus on traceability\nwould allow. First, to interpret the word \u201cfrom\u201d in this lit-\neral way would require a permit in surprising, even bizarre,\ncircumstances, such as for pollutants carried to navigable\nwaters on a bird\u2019s feathers, or, to mention more mundane\ninstances, the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250\nmiles of groundwater to a river.\n   Second, and perhaps most important, the structure of the\nstatute indicates that, as to groundwater pollution and non-\npoint source pollution, Congress intended to leave substan-\ntial responsibility and autonomy to the States. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7101(b), 86 Stat. 816 (stating Congress\u2019 purpose in this re-\ngard). Much water pollution does not come from a readily\nidentifiable source. See 3 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Ency-\nclopedia, at 5801 (defining \u201cWater Pollution\u201d). Rainwater,\nfor example, can carry pollutants (say, as might otherwise\ncollect on a roadway); it can pollute groundwater, and pol-\nlution collected by unchanneled rainwater runoff is not or-\ndinarily considered point source pollution. Over many dec-\nades, and with federal encouragement, the States have\ndeveloped methods of regulating nonpoint source pollution\nthrough water quality standards, and otherwise. See, e.g.,\nNonpoint Source Program, Annual Report (California) 6\n(2016\u20132017) (discussing state timberland management pro-\ngrams to address addition of sediment-pollutants to navi-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Although the Act grants\nEPA specific authority to regulate certain point source pol-\nlution (it can also delegate some of this authority to the\nStates acting under EPA supervision, see \u00a7402(b), 86 Stat.\n880), these permitting provisions refer to \u201cpoint sources\u201d\nand \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d and say nothing at all about non-\npoint source regulation or groundwater regulation. We\nmust doubt that Congress intended to give EPA the author-\nity to apply the word \u201cfrom\u201d in a way that could interfere as\nseriously with States\u2019 traditional regulatory authority\u2014au-\nthority the Act preserves and promotes\u2014as the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d test would.\n   Third, those who look to legislative history to help inter-\npret a statute will find that this Act\u2019s history strongly\nsupports our conclusion that the permitting provision does not\nextend so far. Fifty years ago, when Congress was consid-\nering the bills that became the Clean Water Act, William\nRuckelshaus, the first EPA Administrator, asked Congress\nto grant EPA authority over \u201cground waters\u201d to \u201cassure that\n\f8        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have control over the water table . . . so we can . . . main-\ntai[n] a control over all the sources of pollution, be they dis-\ncharged directly into any stream or through the ground wa-\nter table.\u201d Water Pollution Control Legislation\u20131971\n(Proposed Amendments to Existing Legislation): Hearings\nbefore the House Committee on Public Works, 92d Cong.,\n1st Sess., 230 (1971). Representative Les Aspin similarly\npointed out that there were \u201cconspicuou[s ]\u201d references to\ngroundwater in all sections of the bill except the permitting\nsection at issue here. Water Pollution Control Legislation\u2013\n1971: Hearings before the House Committee on Public\nWorks on H. R. 11896 and H. R. 11895, 92d Cong., 1st Sess.,\n727 (1972). The Senate Committee on Public Works \u201crecog-\nnize[d] the essential link between ground and surface wa-\nters.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u2013414, p. 73 (1971).\n   But Congress did not accept these requests for general\nEPA authority over groundwater. It rejected Representa-\ntive Aspin\u2019s amendment that would have extended the per-\nmitting provision to groundwater. Instead, Congress pro-\nvided a set of more specific groundwater-related measures\nsuch as those requiring States to maintain \u201caffirmative con-\ntrols over the injection or placement in wells\u201d of \u201cany pollu-\ntants that may affect ground water.\u201d Ibid. These specific\nstate-related programs were, in the words of the Senate\nPublic Works Committee, \u201cdesigned to protect ground wa-\nters and eliminate the use of deep well disposal as an un-\ncontrolled alternative to toxic and pollution control.\u201d Ibid.\nThe upshot is that Congress was fully aware of the need to\naddress groundwater pollution, but it satisfied that need\nthrough a variety of state-specific controls. Congress left\ngeneral groundwater regulatory authority to the States; its\nfailure to include groundwater in the general EPA permit-\nting provision was deliberate.\n   Finally, longstanding regulatory practice undermines the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s broad interpretation of the statute.

Train, 556 F. 2d 822,\n832 (CA7 1977) (permit for \u201cdeep waste-injection well\u201d on\nthe shore of navigable waters). But, in doing so, EPA fol-\nlowed a narrower interpretation than that of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit. See, e.g., In re Bethlehem Steel Corp., 2 E. A. D. 715,\n718 (EAB 1989) (Act\u2019s permitting requirement applies only\nto injection wells \u201cthat inject into ground water with a phys-\nically and temporally direct hydrologic connection to sur-\nface water\u201d). EPA has opposed applying the Act\u2019s permit-\nting requirements to discharges that reach groundwater\nonly after lengthy periods. See McClellan Ecological Seep-\nage Situation (MESS) v. Cheney, 763 F. Supp. 431, 437 (ED\nCal. 1989) (United States argued that permitting provisions\ndo not apply when it would take \u201cliterally dozens, and per-\nhaps hundreds, of years for any pollutants\u201d to reach navi-\ngable waters); Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Larson, 641\nF. Supp. 2d 1120, 1139 (Idaho 2009) (same in respect to in-\nstances where it would take \u201cbetween 60 and 420 years\u201d for\npollutants to travel \u201cone to four miles\u201d through groundwa-\nter before reaching navigable waters). Indeed, in this very\ncase (prior to its recent Interpretive Statement, see infra,\nat 12\u201313), EPA asked the Ninth Circuit to apply a more lim-\nited \u201cdirect hydrological connection\u201d test. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae in No. 15\u201317447 (CA9), pp.\n13\u201320. The Ninth Circuit did not accept this suggestion.\n   We do not defer here to EPA\u2019s interpretation of the stat-\nute embodied in this practice. Indeed, EPA itself has\nchanged its mind about the meaning of the statutory provi-\nsion. See infra, at 12\u201314. But this history, by showing that\na comparatively narrow view of the statute is administra-\ntively workable, offers some additional support for the view\nthat Congress did not intend as broad a delegation of regu-\nlatory authority as the Ninth Circuit test would allow.\n   As we have said, the specific meaning of the word \u201cfrom\u201d\n\f10        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessarily draws its meaning from context. The apparent\nbreadth of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d approach is\ninconsistent with the context we have just described.\n                              IV\n                               A\n  Maui and the Solicitor General argue that the statute\u2019s\npermitting requirement does not apply if a pollutant, hav-\ning emerged from a \u201cpoint source,\u201d must travel through any\namount of groundwater before reaching navigable waters.\nThat interpretation is too narrow, for it would risk serious\ninterference with EPA\u2019s ability to regulate ordinary point\nsource discharges.\n  Consider a pipe that spews pollution directly into coastal\nwaters. There is an \u201caddition of \u201d a \u201cpollutant to navigable\nwaters from [a] point source.\u201d Hence, a permit is required.\nBut Maui and the Government read the permitting require-\nment not to apply if there is any amount of groundwater\nbetween the end of the pipe and the edge of the navigable\nwater. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136, 24\u201325. If that is the correct\ninterpretation of the statute, then why could not the pipe\u2019s\nowner, seeking to avoid the permit requirement, simply\nmove the pipe back, perhaps only a few yards, so that the\npollution must travel through at least some groundwater\nbefore reaching the sea? Cf. Brief for State of Maryland et\nal. as Amici Curiae 9, n. 4. We do not see how Congress\ncould have intended to create such a large and obvious loop-\nhole in one of the key regulatory innovations of the Clean\nWater Act. Cf. California ex rel. State Water Resources Con-\ntrol Bd., 426 U. S., at 202\u2013204 (basic purpose of Clean Wa-\nter Act is to regulate pollution at its source); The Emily, 9\nWheat. 381, 390 (1824) (rejecting an interpretation that\nwould facilitate \u201cevasion of the law\u201d).\n                            B\n     Maui argues that the statute\u2019s language requires its\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreading. That language requires a permit for a \u201cdischarge.\u201d\nA \u201cdischarge\u201d is \u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable\nwaters \u201cfrom any point source.\u201d And a \u201cpoint source\u201d is \u201cany\ndiscernible, confined and discrete conveyance\u201d (such as a\npipe, ditch, well, etc.). Reading \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d to-\ngether, Maui argues that the statutory meaning of \u201cfrom\nany point source\u201d is not about where the pollution origi-\nnated, but about how it got there. Under what Maui calls\nthe means-of-delivery test, a permit is required only if a\npoint source itself ultimately delivers the pollutant to nav-\nigable waters. Under this view, if the pollutant must travel\nthrough groundwater to reach navigable waters, then it is\nthe groundwater, not the pipe, that is the conveyance.\n  Congress sometimes adopts less common meanings of\ncommon words, but this esoteric definition of \u201cfrom,\u201d as con-\nnoting a means, does not remotely fit in this context. The\nstatute couples the word \u201cfrom\u201d with the word \u201cto\u201d\u2014strong\nevidence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnav-\nigable waters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d). Further\nunderscoring that Congress intended this every day mean-\ning is that the object of \u201cfrom\u201d is a \u201cpoint source\u201d\u2014a source,\nagain, connoting an origin. That Maui\u2019s proffered interpre-\ntation would also create a serious loophole in the permitting\nregime also indicates it is an unreasonable one.\n                              C\n   The Solicitor General agrees that, as a general matter,\nthe permitting requirement applies to at least some addi-\ntions of pollutants to navigable waters that come indirectly\nfrom point sources. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 33\u201335. But the Solicitor General argues that the\nproper interpretation of the statute is the one reflected in\nEPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement. After receiving more\nthan 50,000 comments from the public, and after the Ninth\nCircuit released its opinion in this case, EPA wrote that\n\f12      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe best, if not the only, reading\u201d of the statutory provi-\nsions is that \u201call releases of pollutants to groundwater\u201d are\nexcluded from the scope of the permitting program, \u201ceven\nwhere pollutants are conveyed to jurisdictional surface wa-\nters via groundwater.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 16810, 16811.\n   Neither the Solicitor General nor any party has asked us\nto give what the Court has referred to as Chevron deference\nto EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute. See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 844 (1984). Even so, we often pay particular attention\nto an agency\u2019s views in light of the agency\u2019s expertise in a\ngiven area, its knowledge gained through practical experi-\nence, and its familiarity with the interpretive demands of\nadministrative need. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533\nU. S. 218, 234\u2013235 (2001); Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134, 139\u2013140 (1944). But here, as we have explained,\nto follow EPA\u2019s reading would open a loophole allowing easy\nevasion of the statutory provision\u2019s basic purposes. Such an\ninterpretation is neither persuasive nor reasonable.\n   EPA correctly points out that Congress did not require a\npermit for all discharges to groundwater; rather, Congress\nauthorized study and funding related to groundwater pol-\nlution. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15\u2013\n19. But there is quite a gap between \u201cnot all\u201d and \u201cnone.\u201d\nThe statutory text itself alludes to no exception for dis-\ncharges through groundwater. These separate provisions\nfor study and funding that EPA points to would be a \u201csur-\nprisingly indirect route\u201d to convey \u201can important and easily\nexpressed message\u201d\u2014that the permit requirement simply\ndoes not apply if the pollutants travel through groundwa-\nter. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 262\n(1994). In truth, the most these provisions show is that\nCongress thought that the problem of groundwater pollu-\ntion, as distinct from navigable water pollution, would pri-\nmarily be addressed by the States or perhaps by other fed-\neral statutes.\n\f                   Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   EPA\u2019s new interpretation is also difficult to reconcile with\nthe statute\u2019s reference to \u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to\nnavigable waters. Cf. Milwaukee, 451 U. S., at 318 (\u201cEvery\npoint source discharge is prohibited unless covered by a per-\nmit\u201d (footnote omitted)). It is difficult to reconcile EPA\u2019s in-\nterpretation with the statute\u2019s inclusion of \u201cwells\u201d in the\ndefinition of \u201cpoint source,\u201d for wells most ordinarily would\ndischarge pollutants through groundwater. And it is diffi-\ncult to reconcile EPA\u2019s interpretation with the statutory\nprovisions that allow EPA to delegate its permitting au-\nthority to a State only if the State (among other things) pro-\nvides \u201c \u2018adequate authority\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018control the disposal of pol-\nlutants into wells.\u2019 \u201d \u00a7402(b), 86 Stat. 881. What need\nwould there be for such a proviso if the federal permitting\nprogram the State replaces did not include such discharges\n(from wells through groundwater) in the first place?\n   In short, EPA\u2019s oblique argument about the statute\u2019s ref-\nerences to groundwater cannot overcome the statute\u2019s\nstructure, its purposes, or the text of the provisions that ac-\ntually govern.\n                               D\n   Perhaps, as the two dissents suggest, the language could\nbe narrowed to similar effect by reading the statute to refer\nonly to the pollutant\u2019s immediate origin. See post, at 2\u20133\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.); post, at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But\nthere is no linguistic basis here to so limit the statute in\nthat way. Again, whether that is the correct reading turns\non context. JUSTICE THOMAS insists that in the case of a\ndischarge through groundwater, the pollutants are added\n\u201cfrom the groundwater.\u201d Post, at 2. Indeed, but that does\nnot mean they are not also \u201cfrom the point source.\u201d Ibid.\nWhen John comes to the hotel, John might have come from\nthe train station, from Baltimore, from Europe, from any\ntwo of those three places, or from all three.

HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclerk includes those who took a taxi from the train station.\nThere is nothing unnatural about such a construction. As\nthe plurality correctly noted in Rapanos v. United States,\n547 U. S. 715 (2006), the statute here does not say \u201cdirectly\u201d\nfrom or \u201cimmediately\u201d from. Id., at 743 (opinion of Scalia,\nJ.). Indeed, the expansive language of the provision\u2014any\naddition from any point source\u2014strongly suggests its scope\nis not so limited.\n   JUSTICE ALITO appears to believe that there are only two\npossible ways to read \u201cfrom\u201d: as referring either to the im-\nmediate source, or else to the original source. Post, at 5, 8.\nBecause he agrees that the statute cannot reasonably be\nread always to reach the original source, he concludes the\nstatute must refer only to the immediate origin. But as the\nforegoing example illustrates, context may indicate that\n\u201cfrom\u201d includes an intermediate stop\u2014Baltimore, not Eu-\nrope or the train station.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS relies on the word \u201caddition,\u201d but we fail\nto see how that word limits the statute to discharges di-\nrectly to navigable waters. Ordinary language abounds in\ncounter examples: A recipe might instruct to \u201cadd the drip-\npings from the meat to the gravy\u201d; that instruction does not\nbecome incomprehensible, or even peculiar, simply because\nthe drippings will have first collected in a pan or on a cut-\nting board. And while it would be an unusual phrasing (as\nstatutory phrasings often are), we do not see how the rec-\nipe\u2019s meaning would transform if it instead said to \u201cadd the\ndrippings to the gravy from the meat.\u201d To take another ex-\nample: If Timmy is told to \u201cadd water to the bath from the\nwell\u201d he will know just what it means\u2014even though he will\nhave to use a bucket to complete the task.\n   And although JUSTICE THOMAS resists the inevitable im-\nplications of his reading of the statute, post, at 5\u20136, that\nreading would create the same loopholes as those offered by\nthe petitioner and the Government, and more. It would nec-\nessarily exclude a pipe that drains onto the beach next to\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnavigable waters, even if the pollutants then flow to those\nwaters. It also seems to exclude a pipe that hangs out over\nthe water and adds pollutants to the air, through which the\npollutants fall to navigable waters. The absurdity of such\nan interpretation is obvious enough.\n  We therefore reject this reading as well: Like Maui\u2019s and\nthe Government\u2019s, it is inconsistent with the statutory text\nand simultaneously creates a massive loophole in the per-\nmitting scheme that Congress established.\n                              E\n  For the reasons set forth in Part III and in this Part, we\nconclude that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure,\nand purposes, the interpretations offered by the parties, the\nGovernment, and the dissents are too extreme.\n                              V\n  Over the years, courts and EPA have tried to find general\nlanguage that will reflect a middle ground between these\nextremes. The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim\nto provide federal regulation of identifiable sources of pol-\nlutants entering navigable waters without undermining the\nStates\u2019 longstanding regulatory authority over land and\ngroundwater. We hold that the statute requires a permit\nwhen there is a direct discharge from a point source into\nnavigable waters or when there is the functional equivalent\nof a direct discharge. We think this phrase best captures,\nin broad terms, those circumstances in which Congress in-\ntended to require a federal permit. That is, an addition falls\nwithin the statutory requirement that it be \u201cfrom any point\nsource\u201d when a point source directly deposits pollutants\ninto navigable waters, or when the discharge reaches the\nsame result through roughly similar means.\n  Time and distance are obviously important. Where a pipe\nends a few feet from navigable waters and the pipe emits\npollutants that travel those few feet through groundwater\n\f16      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(or over the beach), the permitting requirement clearly ap-\nplies. If the pipe ends 50 miles from navigable waters and\nthe pipe emits pollutants that travel with groundwater, mix\nwith much other material, and end up in navigable waters\nonly many years later, the permitting requirements likely\ndo not apply.\n   The object in a given scenario will be to advance, in a\nmanner consistent with the statute\u2019s language, the statu-\ntory purposes that Congress sought to achieve. As we have\nsaid (repeatedly), the word \u201cfrom\u201d seeks a \u201cpoint source\u201d\norigin, and context imposes natural limits as to when a\npoint source can properly be considered the origin of pollu-\ntion that travels through groundwater. That context in-\ncludes the need, reflected in the statute, to preserve state\nregulation of groundwater and other nonpoint sources of\npollution. Whether pollutants that arrive at navigable wa-\nters after traveling through groundwater are \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource depends upon how similar to (or different from) the\nparticular discharge is to a direct discharge.\n   The difficulty with this approach, we recognize, is that it\ndoes not, on its own, clearly explain how to deal with middle\ninstances. But there are too many potentially relevant fac-\ntors applicable to factually different cases for this Court\nnow to use more specific language. Consider, for example,\njust some of the factors that may prove relevant (depending\nupon the circumstances of a particular case): (1) transit\ntime, (2) distance traveled, (3) the nature of the material\nthrough which the pollutant travels, (4) the extent to which\nthe pollutant is diluted or chemically changed as it travels,\n(5) the amount of pollutant entering the navigable waters\nrelative to the amount of the pollutant that leaves the point\nsource, (6) the manner by or area in which the pollutant\nenters the navigable waters, (7) the degree to which the pol-\nlution (at that point) has maintained its specific identity.\nTime and distance will be the most important factors in\nmost cases, but not necessarily every case.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, courts can provide guidance through\ndecisions in individual cases. The Circuits have tried to do\nso, often using general language somewhat similar to the\nlanguage we have used. And the traditional common-law\nmethod, making decisions that provide examples that in\nturn lead to ever more refined principles, is sometimes use-\nful, even in an era of statutes.\n   The underlying statutory objectives also provide guid-\nance. Decisions should not create serious risks either of un-\ndermining state regulation of groundwater or of creating\nloopholes that undermine the statute\u2019s basic federal regu-\nlatory objectives.\n   EPA, too, can provide administrative guidance (within\nstatutory boundaries) in numerous ways, including\nthrough, for example, grants of individual permits, promul-\ngation of general permits, or the development of general\nrules. Indeed, over the years, EPA and the States have of-\nten considered the Act\u2019s application to discharges through\ngroundwater.\n   Both Maui and the Government object that to subject dis-\ncharges to navigable waters through groundwater to the\nstatute\u2019s permitting requirements, as our interpretation\nwill sometimes do, would vastly expand the scope of the\nstatute, perhaps requiring permits for each of the 650,000\nwells like petitioner\u2019s or for each of the over 20 million sep-\ntic systems used in many Americans\u2019 homes. Brief for Pe-\ntitioner 44\u201348; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n24\u201325. Cf. Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S.\n302, 324 (2014).\n   But EPA has applied the permitting provision to some\n(but not to all) discharges through groundwater for over 30\nyears. See supra, at 8\u20139. In that time we have seen no\nevidence of unmanageable expansion. EPA and the States\nalso have tools to mitigate those harms, should they arise,\nby (for example) developing general permits for recurring\nsituations or by issuing permits based on best practices\n\f18      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhere appropriate. See, e.g., 40 CFR \u00a7122.44(k) (2019).\nJudges, too, can mitigate any hardship or injustice when\nthey apply the statute\u2019s penalty provision. That provision\nvests courts with broad discretion to set a penalty that\ntakes account of many factors, including \u201cany good-faith ef-\nforts to comply\u201d with the Act, the \u201cseriousness of the viola-\ntion,\u201d the \u201ceconomic impact of the penalty on the violator,\u201d\nand \u201csuch other matters as justice may require.\u201d See 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71319(d). We expect that district judges will exer-\ncise their discretion mindful, as we are, of the complexities\ninherent to the context of indirect discharges through\ngroundwater, so as to calibrate the Act\u2019s penalties when, for\nexample, a party could reasonably have thought that a per-\nmit was not required.\n   In sum, we recognize that a more absolute position, such\nas the means-of-delivery test or that of the Government or\nthat of the Ninth Circuit, may be easier to administer. But,\nas we have said, those positions have consequences that are\ninconsistent with major congressional objectives, as re-\nvealed by the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purposes.\nWe consequently understand the permitting requirement,\n\u00a7301, as applicable to a discharge (from a point source) of\npollutants that reach navigable waters after traveling\nthrough groundwater if that discharge is the functional\nequivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into\nnavigable waters.\n                            VI\n  Because the Ninth Circuit applied a different standard,\nwe vacate its judgment and remand the case for further pro-\nceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

I write separately to\nemphasize three points.\n   First, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act\nregarding pollution \u201cfrom\u201d point sources adheres to the in-\nterpretation set forth in Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in\nRapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006). The Clean\nWater Act requires a permit for \u201cany addition of any pollu-\ntant to navigable waters from any point source.\u201d 33 U. S.\nC. \u00a71362(12)(A); see \u00a7\u00a71311(a), 1342(a). The key word is\n\u201cfrom.\u201d The question in this case is whether the County of\nMaui needs a permit for its Lahaina Wastewater Reclama-\ntion Facility. No one disputes that pollutants originated at\nMaui\u2019s wastewater facility (a point source), and no one dis-\nputes that the pollutants ended up in the Pacific Ocean (a\nnavigable water). Maui contends, however, that it does not\nneed a permit. Maui says that the pollutants did not come\n\u201cfrom\u201d the Lahaina facility because the pollutants traveled\nthrough groundwater before reaching the ocean.\n   Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in Rapanos explained\nwhy Maui\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is incor-\nrect. In that case, Justice Scalia stated that polluters could\nnot \u201cevade the permitting requirement of \u00a71342(a) simply\nby discharging their pollutants into noncovered intermit-\ntent watercourses that lie upstream of covered waters.\u201d 547\n\f2       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nU. S., at 742\u2013743. Justice Scalia reasoned that the Clean\nWater Act does not merely \u201cforbid the \u2018addition of any pol-\nlutant directly to navigable waters from any point source,\u2019\nbut rather the \u2018addition of any pollutant to navigable wa-\nters.\u2019 Thus, from the time of the CWA\u2019s enactment, lower\ncourts have held that the discharge into intermittent chan-\nnels of any pollutant that naturally washes downstream\nlikely violates \u00a71311(a), even if the pollutants discharged\nfrom a point source do not emit \u2018directly into\u2019 covered wa-\nters, but pass \u2018through conveyances\u2019 in between.\u201d Id., at 743\n(citations omitted).\n   In other words, under Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation in\nRapanos, the fact that the pollutants from Maui\u2019s\nwastewater facility reach the ocean via an indirect route\ndoes not itself exempt Maui\u2019s facility from the Clean Water\nAct\u2019s permitting requirement for point sources. The Court\ntoday adheres to Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis in Rapanos on\nthat issue.\n   Second, as Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Rapanos pointed\nout and as the Court\u2019s opinion today explains, the statute\ndoes not establish a bright-line test regarding when a pol-\nlutant may be considered to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource. The source of the vagueness is Congress\u2019 statutory\ntext, not the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court\u2019s opinion seeks to\ntranslate the vague statutory text into more concrete\nguidance.\n   Third, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent states that \u201cthe Court\ndoes not commit\u201d to \u201cwhich factors are the most important\u201d\nin determining whether pollutants that enter navigable wa-\nters come \u201cfrom\u201d a point source. Post, at 5. That critique is\nnot accurate, as I read the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court iden-\ntifies relevant factors to consider and emphasizes that\n\u201c[t]ime and distance are obviously important.\u201d Ante, at 15.\nAnd the Court expressly adds that \u201c[t]ime and distance will\nbe the most important factors in most cases, but not neces-\nsarily every case.\u201d Ante, at 16.

S. C.\n\u00a71311(a); see \u00a71342. The CWA defines a \u201cdischarge\u201d as \u201cany\naddition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any\npoint source.\u201d \u00a71362(12).1 Based on the statutory text and\nstructure, I would hold that a permit is required only when\na point source discharges pollutants directly into navigable\nwaters. The Court adopts this interpretation in part, con-\ncluding that a permit is required for \u201ca direct discharge.\u201d\nAnte, at 15. But the Court then departs from the statutory\ntext by requiring a permit for \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge,\u201d ibid., which it defines through an open-\nended inquiry into congressional intent and practical con-\nsiderations. Because I would adhere to the text, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The CWA defines \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as \u201cthe waters of the United\n\nStates, including the territorial seas.\u201d \u00a71362(7). It defines a \u201cpoint\nsource\u201d as \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including\nbut not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete\nfissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation,\nor vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be dis-\ncharged,\u201d excluding \u201cagricultural stormwater discharges and return\nflows from irrigated agriculture.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               I\n                               A\n   In interpreting the statutory definition of \u201cdischarge,\u201d the\nCourt focuses on the word \u201cfrom,\u201d but the most helpful word\nis \u201caddition.\u201d That word, together with \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfrom,\u201d\nlimits the meaning of \u201cdischarge\u201d to the augmentation of\nnavigable waters.\n   Dictionary definitions of \u201caddition\u201d denote an augmenta-\ntion or increase. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary defines \u201caddition\u201d as \u201cthe act or process of adding:\nthe joining or uniting of one thing to another.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 24 (1961); see also ibid.\n(listing \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201caugmentation\u201d as synonyms for \u201cad-\ndition\u201d). Other dictionary definitions from around the time\nof the statute\u2019s enactment are in accord. See, e.g., American\nHeritage Dictionary 14, 15 (1981) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he act or process of adding\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as \u201c[t]o\njoin or unite so as to increase in size, quantity, or scope\u201d);\nsee also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 29, 30 (2d\ned. 1957) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as the \u201c[a]ct, process, or in-\nstance of adding,\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as to \u201cjoin or unite, as\none thing to another, or as several particulars, so as to in-\ncrease the number, augment the quantity, enlarge the mag-\nnitude, or so as to form into one aggregate\u201d).\n   The inclusion of the term \u201caddition\u201d in the CWA indicates\nthat the statute excludes anything other than a direct dis-\ncharge. When a point source releases pollutants to ground-\nwater, one would naturally say that the groundwater has\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. If\nthe pollutants eventually reach navigable waters, one\nwould not naturally say that the navigable waters have\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. The\naugmentation instead occurs with pollutants from the\ngroundwater.\n   The prepositions \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d reinforce this reading.\nWhen pollutants are released from a point source to another\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npoint source or groundwater, they are added to the second\nfrom the first. If the pollutants are later released to navi-\ngable waters, they are added to the navigable waters from\nthe second point source or the groundwater. One would not\nnaturally say that the pollutants are added to the navigable\nwaters from the original point source.\n   Interpreting \u201cdischarge\u201d to mean a direct discharge\nmakes sense of other parts of the definition as well. It re-\nspects the statutory definition of a point source as a \u201ccon-\nveyance,\u201d see \u00a71362(14), because a point source that re-\nleases pollutants directly into navigable waters is a means\nof conveyance. And it makes sense of the word \u201cany\u201d before\n\u201cpoint source,\u201d because that term clarifies that any kind of\npoint source may require a permit.\n   The structure of the CWA confirms this interpretation. It\nauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to\nregulate discharges from point sources, including through\nthe permitting process, but it reserves to the States the pri-\nmary responsibility for regulating other sources of pollu-\ntion, including groundwater. With respect to these sources,\nthe EPA merely collects information, coordinates with the\nStates, and provides funding. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71252(a),\n1254(a)(5), 1282(b)(2), 1288, 1314(a), 1329; ante, at 6\u20137. In\nthe CWA, Congress expressly stated its \u201cpolicy . . . to recog-\nnize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and\nrights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution.\u201d\n\u00a71251(b). Thus, construing the EPA\u2019s power to regulate\npoint sources to allow the agency to regulate nonpoint\nsources and groundwater is in serious tension with Con-\ngress\u2019 design.\n   My reading is also consistent with our decision in South\nFla. Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, 541 U. S.\n95 (2004). The petitioner in that case argued that no permit\nwas required when a point source was not the original\nsource of the pollutant but instead conveyed the pollutant\nfrom further up a chain of sources. Id., at 104. We rejected\n\f4        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat argument because \u201ca point source need not be the orig-\ninal source of the pollutant; it need only convey the pollu-\ntant to \u2018navigable waters.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 105. Although that case\ndid not involve the exact question presented here, the\ndirect-discharge interpretation comports well with that\nprevious decision.\n                                B\n   The Court\u2019s main textual argument reads the word\n\u201cfrom\u201d in isolation. But as the Court recognizes, \u201cthe word\n\u2018from\u2019 necessarily draws its meaning from context.\u201d Ante,\nat 9\u201310. The Court\u2019s example using \u201carrive\u201d instead of \u201cad-\ndition\u201d is thus unpersuasive, ante, at 13\u201314, because \u201cfrom\u201d\ntakes different meanings with different verbs. The Court\u2019s\nculinary example also misses the mark, ante, at 14, because\nif the drippings from the meat collect in the pan before the\nchef adds them to the gravy, the drippings are added to the\ngravy from the pan, not from the meat. This point becomes\nclear if we reorder the majority\u2019s recipe to match the stat-\nute; the chef has not added the drippings to the gravy from\nthe meat. The Court\u2019s bathwater example, ante, at 14, suf-\nfers from the same problem; if the well water is put in a\nbucket before it is put in the bathtub, it is added to the bath-\ntub from the bucket. Only by reading the phrase in its en-\ntirety can we interpret the definition of \u201cdischarge.\u201d See\nDeal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132 (1993).\n   The Court also asserts that a narrower reading than the\none it adopts would create a \u201cmassive loophole\u201d in the stat-\nute. Ante, at 15. Far from creating a loophole, my reading\nis the most logical because it is consonant with the scope of\nCongress\u2019 power. The CWA presumably was passed as an\nexercise of Congress\u2019 authority \u201cto regulate Commerce with\nforeign Nations, and among the several States, and with\nthe Indian Tribes.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3. My inter-\npretation ties the statute more closely to navigable waters,\non the theory that they are at least a channel of these kinds\n\f                      Cite as: 590 U.

As the Court acknowledges, its opinion\ngives almost no guidance, save for a list of seven factors.\nBut the Court does not commit to whether those factors are\nthe only relevant ones, whether those factors are always\nrelevant, or which factors are the most important. See ante,\nat 15\u201316. It ultimately does little to explain how function-\nally equivalent an indirect discharge must be to require a\npermit.2\n   The Court suggests that the EPA could clarify matters\nthrough \u201cadministrative guidance,\u201d ante, at 17, but so far\nthe EPA has provided only limited advice and recently\nshifted its position, see 84 Fed. Reg. 16810 (2019); ante, at\n11\u201312. In any event, the sort of \u201c \u2018general rules\u2019 \u201d that the\nCourt hopes the EPA will promulgate are constitutionally\nsuspect. See Department of Transportation v. Association\nof American Railroads, 575 U. S. 43, 67\u201387 (2015)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Despite giving minimal guidance as to how this case\nshould be decided on remand, the majority speculates about\nwhether a permit would be required in other factual circum-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH believes that the Court\u2019s opinion provides\n\nenough guidance when it states that \u201c[t]ime and distance will be the most\nimportant factors in most cases, but not necessarily every case,\u201d ante, at\n16 (majority opinion) (emphasis added). See ante, at 2 (concurring opin-\nion). His hope for guidance appears misplaced. For all we know, these\nfactors may not be the most important in 49 percent of cases. The ma-\njority\u2019s nonexhaustive seven-factor test \u201cmay aid in identifying relevant\nfacts for analysis, but\u2014like most multifactor tests\u2014it leaves courts\nadrift once those facts have been identified.\u201d Dietz v.

It poses the examples of a pipe that releases pol-\nlutants over navigable waters and a pipe that releases pol-\nlutants onto land near navigable waters. As an initial mat-\nter, I am not as sure as the majority that a \u201cpollutant,\u201d as\ndefined by the CWA, may be added to the air.3 Even if the\nmajority is correct that a permit is not required in these\nhypothetical cases, drawing the line at discharges to water\nis not so absurd as to undermine the most natural reading\nof the statute. In any event, it is unnecessary to decide\nthese hypothetical cases today.\n   Finally, the Court speculates as to \u201cthose circumstances\nin which Congress intended to require a federal permit.\u201d\nAnte, at 15. But we are not a superlegislature (or super-\nEPA) tasked with making good policy\u2014assuming that is\neven what the Court accomplishes today. \u201cOur job is to fol-\nlow the text even if doing so will supposedly undercut a\nbasic objective of the statute.\u201d Baker Botts L. L. P. v.\nASARCO LLC, 576 U. S. 121, 135 (2015) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n                             II\n  I do agree with the Court on several points. First, the\ninterpretation adopted by respondents and the Ninth Cir-\ncuit is unsupportable. That interpretation\u2014which would\nrequire permits for discharges that are \u201c \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 \u201d\nto, and proximately caused by, a point source\u2014is atextual\nand unsettles the CWA\u2019s careful balance between federal\nregulation of point-source pollution and state regulation of\nnonpoint-source pollution. Ante, at 5\u20139.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The CWA defines a \u201cpollutant\u201d as \u201cdredged spoil, solid waste, incin-\n\nerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical\nwastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or dis-\ncarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, and\nagricultural waste discharged into water,\u201d with certain exceptions.\n\u00a71362(6).\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Second, I agree that the interpretation adopted by peti-\ntioner and JUSTICE ALITO reads the word \u201cany\u201d unnatu-\nrally, ante, at 11, although the majority appears to deploy\nthat argument itself in another part of the opinion, ante, at\n14. Petitioner\u2019s and JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s interpretation also\ngives insufficient weight to the meaning of \u201caddition,\u201d see\nsupra, at 2.\n   Third, I agree that the EPA\u2019s interpretation is not enti-\ntled to deference for at least two reasons: No party requests\nit, and the EPA\u2019s reading is not the best one. Ante, at 12\u2013\n13. I add only that deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837\n(1984), likely conflicts with the Vesting Clauses of the Con-\nstitution. See Baldwin v. United States, 589 U. S. ___, ___\u2013\n___ (2020) (THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)\n(slip op., at 2\u20138); Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.

S. 92, 115\u2013126 (2015) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Finally, I agree with the Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that\nRapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006), does not re-\nsolve this case. That plurality opinion, which I joined, ob-\nserved that lower courts have required a permit when pol-\nlutants pass through a chain of point sources. Id., at 743\u2013\n744. But we expressly said in Rapanos that \u201cwe [did] not\ndecide this issue.\u201d Id., at 743. We are not bound by dictum\nin a plurality opinion or by the lower court opinions it cited.\n                              III\n  The best reading of the statute is that a \u201cdischarge\u201d is the\nrelease of pollutants directly from a point source to naviga-\nble waters. The application of this interpretation to the un-\ndisputed facts of this case makes a remand unnecessary.\nPetitioner operates a wastewater treatment facility and in-\njects treated wastewater into four underground injection\ncontrol wells.

Here, however, the Court makes up a rule\nthat provides no clear guidance and invites arbitrary and\ninconsistent application.\n  The text of the Clean Water Act generally requires a per-\nmit when a discharge \u201cfrom\u201d a \u201cpoint source\u201d (such as a\npipe) \u201cadd[s]\u201d a pollutant \u201cto\u201d navigable waters (such as the\nPacific Ocean). 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(12). There are two ways\nto read this text. A pollutant that reaches the ocean could\nbe understood to have been added \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if the\npipe originally discharged the pollutant and the pollutant\neventually made its way to the ocean by flowing over or un-\nder the surface of the ground. Or a pollutant that reaches\nthe ocean could be understood to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if\nthe pollutant is discharged from the pipe directly into the\nocean.\n  There is no comprehensible alternative to these two\ninterpretations, but the Court refuses to accept either.\nBoth alternatives, it believes, lead to unacceptable results,\nand it therefore tries to find a middle way. It holds that a\npermit is required \u201cwhen there is a direct discharge from a\npoint source into navigable waters or when there is the\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfunctional equivalent of a direct discharge.\u201d Ante, at 15.\nThis is not a plausible interpretation of the statutory text\nand, to make matters worse, the Court\u2019s test has no clear\nmeaning.\n   Just what is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a \u201cdirect dis-\ncharge\u201d? The Court provides no real answer. All it will say\nis that the distance a pollutant travels and the time this\ntrip entails are the most important factors, but at least five\nother factors may have a bearing on the question, and even\nthis list is not exhaustive. Ante, at 16. Entities like water\ntreatment authorities that need to know whether they must\nget a permit are left to guess how this nebulous standard\nwill be applied. Regulators are given the discretion, at least\nin the first instance, to make of this standard what they\nwill. And the lower courts? The Court\u2019s advice, in essence,\nis: \u201cThat\u2019s your problem. Muddle through as best you can.\u201d\n                               I\n  Petitioner, the County of Maui (County), built the\nLahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility in the 1970s.\nExcerpts of Record 304. The facility receives sewage and\nthen discharges treated wastewater into wells (essentially\nlong pipes) that extend 200 feet or more below ground level.\nId., at 694\u2013695. Some of this discharge enters an aquifer\nbelow the facility. Id., at 696.\n  In all the years of its operation, the facility has never had\na National Pollution Discharge Elimination System\n(NPDES) permit for discharges from the wells, a fact that\nhas been well known to both the EPA and the Hawaii De-\npartment of Health (HDOH).

Both the\nEPA and the HDOH received and submitted comments on\nthe report without any mention of a need for permitting dis-\ncharges from the wells. Id., at 140.

And in a May\n1985 NPDES Compliance Monitoring Report, the EPA con-\ncluded that the County was operating in compliance with\nthe permit, because all effluent was entering the injection\nwells\u2014and was thus destined for groundwater rather than\nfor navigable waters or for use in irrigation. Id., at 141,\n222. In 1994, HDOH again informed the EPA that \u201call ex-\nperts agree that the wastewater does enter the ocean.\u201d Id.,\nat 369.

The term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d\nhas a well-known meaning, but the broader term \u201cwaters of the United\nStates\u201d is not defined by the Clean Water Act and has presented a diffi-\ncult issue for this Court. See Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715\n(2006). The EPA\u2019s definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d expressly\nexcludes groundwater, see 40 CFR \u00a7122.2 (2019); 84 Fed.

The Act includes a non-exhaustive\nlist of conveyances that fall within this definition, and in-\ncluded on that list are such things as \u201cpipe[s],\u201d \u201cditch[es],\u201d\n\u201cchannel[s],\u201d and \u201cwell[s].\u201d Ibid.\n   Putting all these statutory terms together, the rule can\nbe stated as follows: A permit is required when a pollutant\nis \u201cadd[ed]\u201d to navigable waters \u201cfrom\u201d a \u201cpoint source.\u201d In\nthis case, the parties and the EPA agree that most of\nthe elements of this rule are met. Specifically, they agree\nthat: The effluent emitted by the wells is a \u201cpollutant\u201d; this\neffluent reaches navigable waters (the Pacific Ocean); and\nthe wells are \u201cpoint source[s].\u201d The disputed question is\nwhether the emission of effluent from those wells qualifies\nas a \u201cdischarge,\u201d that is, the addition of a pollutant \u201cfrom\u201d\na point source. \u00a71362(12) (emphasis added).\n   There are two possible interpretations of this phrase.\nThe first is that pollutants are added to navigable waters\nfrom a point source whenever they originally came from the\npoint source. The second is that pollutants are added to\nnavigable waters only if they were discharged from a point\nsource directly into navigable waters.\n   Dissatisfied with those options, the Court tries to find a\nthird, but its interpretation is very hard to fit into the stat-\nutory text. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, it appears\nthat a pollutant that leaves a point source and heads to-\nward navigable waters via some non-point source (such as\nby flowing over the ground or by means of groundwater) is\n\u201cfrom\u201d the point source for some portion of its journey, but\nonce it has travelled a certain distance or once a certain\namount of time has elapsed, it is no longer \u201cfrom\u201d the point\nsource and is instead \u201cfrom\u201d a non-point source.\n   This is an implausible reading of the statute. The Court\nhas many inventive examples of the different meanings\nthat can be conveyed by the simple statement that A comes\nfrom B, but one of the Court\u2019s examples\u2014the traveler who\n\f6       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nflies from Europe to Baltimore\u2014illustrates the problem. If\nwe apply the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71362 to this trav-\neler\u2019s journey, he would be \u201cfrom\u201d Europe for the first part\nof the flight, but at some point he might cease to be \u201cfrom\u201d\nEurope and would then be from someplace else, maybe\nGreenland or geographical coordinates in the middle of the\nAtlantic. This is a very strange notion, and therefore, I\nthink the statutory text compels us to choose between the\ntwo alternatives set out above.\n   The Court rejects both of these because it thinks they lead\nto unacceptably extreme results. \u201cOriginally from\u201d would\nimpose liability even if pollutants discharged into ground\nwater had to travel 250 miles over the course of 100 years\nbefore reaching navigable waters. See ante, at 6. And \u201c \u2018im-\nmediately\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018directly\u2019 from,\u201d the Court thinks, would\nmean that a polluter could evade the permit requirement\nby discharging pollutants from a pipe located just a few feet\nfrom navigable waters. Ante, at 14\u201315.\n   To escape these possibilities, the Court devises its own\ntest: A permit is required, the Court holds, \u201cwhen there is a\ndirect discharge from a point source into navigable waters\nor when there is the functional equivalent of a direct dis-\ncharge.\u201d Ante, at 15 (emphasis in original). The Clean Wa-\nter Act, however, says nothing about \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent\u201d of a direct discharge. That is the Court\u2019s own\nconcoction, and the Court provides no clear explanation of\nits meaning.\n   The term \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d may have a quasi-\ntechnical ring, but what does it mean? \u201cEquivalent\u201d means\n\u201cequal\u201d in some respect, and \u201cfunctional\u201d signifies a rela-\ntionship to a function. The function of a direct discharge\nfrom a point source into navigable waters is to convey the\nentirety of the discharge into navigable waters without any\ndelay. Therefore, the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a direct dis-\ncharge of a pollutant into navigable waters would seem to\nbe a discharge that is equal to a direct discharge in these\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrespects.\n   If that is what the Court meant by \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent of a direct discharge,\u201d the test would apply at best to\nonly a small set of situations not involving a direct dis-\ncharge. The Court\u2019s example of a pipe that emits pollutants\na few feet from the ocean would presumably qualify on de\nminimis grounds, but if the pipe were moved back any\nsignificant distance, the discharge would not be exactly\nequal to a direct discharge. There would be some lag from\nthe time of the discharge to the time when the pollutant\nreaches navigable waters; some of the pollutant might not\nreach that destination; and the pollutant might have\nchanged somewhat in composition by the time it reached\nthe navigable waters.\n   For these reasons, the Court\u2019s reference to \u201cthe functional\nequivalent of a direct discharge,\u201d if taken literally, would be\nof little importance, but the Court\u2019s understanding of this\nconcept is very different from the literal meaning of the\nphrase. As used by the Court, \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge\u201d means a discharge that is sufficiently\nsimilar to a direct discharge to warrant a permit in light of\nthe Clean Water Act\u2019s \u201clanguage, structure, and purposes.\u201d\nSee ante, at 18. But what, in concrete terms, does this\nmean? How similar is sufficiently similar?\n   The Court provides this guidance. It explains that time\nand distance are the most important factors, ante, at 16, but\nit does not set any time or distance limits except to observe\nthat a permit is needed where the discharge is a few feet\naway from navigable waters and that a permit is not re-\nquired where the discharge is far away and it takes \u201cmany\nyears\u201d for the pollutants to complete the journey. Ante, at\n15\u201316. Beyond this, the Court provides a list (and a non-\nexhaustive one at that!) of five other factors that may be\nrelevant: \u201cthe nature of the material through which the pol-\nlutant travels,\u201d \u201cthe extent to which the pollutant is diluted\n\f8       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nor chemically changed as it travels,\u201d \u201cthe amount of pollu-\ntant entering the navigable waters relative to the amount\nof the pollutant that leaves the point source,\u201d \u201cthe manner\nby or area in which the pollutant enters the navigable wa-\nters,\u201d and \u201cthe degree to which the pollution (at that point)\nhas maintained its specific identity.\u201d Ante, at 16.\n   The Court admits that its rule \u201cdoes not, on its own,\nclearly explain how to deal with middle instances,\u201d ibid.,\nbut that admission does not go far enough. How the rule\napplies to \u201cmiddle instances\u201d is anybody\u2019s guess. Except in\nextreme cases, dischargers will be able to argue that the\nCourt\u2019s multifactor test does not require a permit. Oppo-\nnents will be able to make the opposite argument. Regula-\ntors will be able to justify whatever result they prefer in a\nparticular case. And judges will be left at sea.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Instead of concocting our own rule, I would interpret the\nwords of the statute, and in my view, the better of the two\npossible interpretations is that a permit is required when a\npollutant is discharged directly from a point source to nav-\nigable waters. This interpretation is consistent with the\nstatutory language and better fits the overall scheme of the\nClean Water Act. And properly understood, it does not have\nthe sort of extreme consequences that the Court finds\nunacceptable.\n   Take the Court\u2019s example of a pipe that discharges pollu-\ntants a short distance from the ocean. Ante, at 10. This\npipe qualifies as a point source. 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(14). If\nits discharge goes directly into another point source and\nthat point source discharges directly into navigable waters,\nthere is a direct discharge into navigable waters, and a per-\nmit is needed.

But I take\nJUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s opinion to foreclose liability in one situation where I\nbelieve a permit would be required: a discharge from multiple, linked\npoint sources. In my view, a permit is required in that instance because\na pollutant would ultimately be added to navigable waters directly from\na point source.\n   Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 743\u2013744 (plurality\nopinion), supports this conclusion. Rapanos addressed the meaning of\nthe term \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d and Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion con-\ncluded that this term does not apply to \u201c[w]etlands with only an inter-\nmittent, physically remote hydrologic connection to [such waters].\u201d Id.,\nat 742. At one point in his opinion, Justice Scalia responded to the argu-\nment that this interpretation would allow polluters to evade the permit\nrequirement \u201csimply by discharging their pollutants into noncovered in-\ntermittent watercourses that lie upstream of covered waters.\u201d Id., at\n743. Arguing that this was not likely to occur, he identified two lines of\nlower court authority that would prevent such evasion, but he did not\nendorse either. Ibid.\n   One of these lines was based on exactly the interpretation set out in\nthis opinion, namely, that \u201csuch upstream, intermittently flowing chan-\nnels themselves constitute \u2018point sources\u2019 \u201d under the Act\u2019s broad defini-\ntion of that term. Ibid. The other line, as described in Justice Scalia\u2019s\nopinion, \u201cheld that the discharge into intermittent channels of any pol-\nlutant that naturally washes downstream likely [requires a permit] even\nif the pollutants discharged from a point source do not emit \u2018directly into\u2019\ncovered waters, but pass \u2018through conveyances\u2019 in between.\u201d Ibid. (em-\nphasis in original). To the extent these lower court cases are understood\nas holding that a permit is required whenever a pollutant \u201cnaturally\u201d\nreaches waters of the United States, their reasoning would conflict with\nthe Court\u2019s rejection of the theory that a permit is required whenever a\npollutant that originated from a point source ultimately reaches covered\nwaters. But as Justice Scalia noted, in the two cases he cited, the pollu-\ntants were discharged from point sources into \u201cconveyances\u201d that, in\nturn, brought the pollutants to covered waters. Ibid. And the convey-\nances in both cases, a sewer system and tunnel, ibid., could easily fall\nwithin the broad definition of a point source.\n   In short, at least one and perhaps both of the lines of lower court cases\nto which Justice Scalia referred are fully consistent with the interpreta-\ntion set out in this opinion. The same is true of his statement, discussed\nby JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, ante, at 1\u20132 (concurring opinion), that the Clean\n\f10         COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   That a permit is required in this situation is important\nbecause the Clean Water Act\u2019s definition of a \u201cpoint source\u201d\nis very broad, and as a result, many discharges onto the\nsurface of land are likely to be covered. As noted, \u201cpoint\nsource[s]\u201d include \u201cditch[es]\u201d and \u201cchannel[s],\u201d as well as\n\u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance . . . from\nwhich pollutants . . . may be discharged.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\nTherefore if water discharged on the surface of the land\nfinds or creates a passage leading to navigable waters, a\npermit may be required if the course that the discharge\ntakes is (1) a \u201cconveyance\u201d that is (2) \u201cdiscernible\u201d and (3)\n\u201cconfined.\u201d\n   Those three requirements are rather easily satisfied.\nWhen a liquid flows over the surface of land to navigable\nwaters, the surface is a conveyance, i.e., a \u201cmeans of carry-\ning or transporting something\u201d from one place to another.\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 499 (1971)\n(Webster\u2019s Third); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 320 (1967) (Random House).6 This conveyance\nwould be \u201cdiscernible,\u201d i.e., capable of being seen. Webster\u2019s\nThird 644; Random House 409. And it would be \u201cconfined,\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWater Act \u201cdoes not forbid the \u2018addition of any pollutant directly to nav-\nigable waters from any point source.\u2019 \u201d 547 U. S., at 743. As noted, Jus-\ntice Scalia\u2019s opinion is open to the possibility that a permit is required if\npoint source A discharges into point source B, and point source B then\ndischarges into covered waters. Thus, his opinion apparently regards\nthat situation as involving an indirect discharge. I would describe that\ndischarge as direct because point source B discharges directly into cov-\nered waters, but the difference is purely semantic.\n   6 As we have said, the Act\u2019s point-source \u201cdefinition makes plain that a\n\npoint source need not be the original source of the pollutant; it need only\nconvey the pollutant to \u2018navigable waters,\u2019 which are, in turn, defined as\n\u2018the waters of the United States.\u2019 \u201d South Fla.

Moreover\u2014and I find this point partic-\nularly important\u2014even if this interpretation fails to cap-\nture every case that seems to call out for regulation, that\nwould not mean that these cases would necessarily remain\nunchecked. The States have the authority to regulate the\ndischarge of pollutants by non-point sources. See 33\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71285(j), 1314(f ), 1329(i), 1329(b)(1), (h). They are\nentrusted with a vital role under the Clean Water Act, and\nthere is no reason to believe that they would tolerate cases\nof abuse.\n   The interpretation I have outlined is not only consistent\nwith the statutory language; it is strongly supported by the\nClean Water Act\u2019s regulatory scheme for at least two rea-\nsons. First, it respects Congress\u2019 decision to treat point-\nsource pollution differently from non-point-source pollu-\ntion, including pollution conveyed by groundwater. See 84\nFed. Reg. 16832.7 The Court itself recognizes this:\n     \u201c[T]he structure of the statute indicates that, as to\n     groundwater pollution and non[-]point source pollu-\n     tion, Congress intended to leave substantial responsi-\n     bility and autonomy to the States.\u201d Ante, at 6.\n     \u201cOver many decades, and with federal encouragement,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Act contains a number of references to groundwater (a non-point\n\nsource) outside the NPDES context. The Act textually distinguishes\ngroundwater from surface water and navigable waters, \u00a71252(a), pro-\nvides funding for state regulation of groundwater pollution, and suggests\nthat groundwater is a non-point source. See \u00a71329(h)(5)(D) (authorizing\nEPA to prioritize grants to States that have implemented or proposed\n\u201ccarry[ing] out groundwater quality protection activities which [EPA] de-\ntermines are part of a comprehensive non[-]point source pollution control\nprogram\u201d).\n\f12       COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Non-point\nsource pollution, on the other hand, often presents more\ncomplicated issues that are better suited to individualized\nlocal solutions. See Shanty Town Assns. L. P. v. EPA, 843\nF. 2d 782, 791 (CA4 1988) (\u201c[T]he control of non[-]point\nsource pollution was so dependent on such site-specific fac-\ntors as topography, soil structure, rainfall, vegetation, and\nland use that its uniform federal regulation was virtually\nimpossible\u201d); Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA,\n915 F. 2d 1314, 1316 (CA9 1990) (\u201cThe Act focused on point\nsource polluters presumably because they could be\nidentified and regulated more easily than non[-]point\nsource polluters\u201d); Brief for State of West Virginia et al. as\nAmici Curiae 14\u201318.\n  Second, this bright-line rule is consistent with the Act\u2019s\nremedial scheme.

The inter-\npretation set out above, by providing a relatively\nstraightforward rule, provides a measure of fair notice and\npromotes good-faith compliance.\n                              B\n  The alternative way in which the statutory language\ncould be interpreted\u2014reading \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201coriginally\nfrom\u201d\u2014would lead to extreme results, as the Court recog-\nnizes. And while state regulation could fill any unwar-\nranted gaps left by the interpretation I have outlined, there\nwould be no apparent remedy for the overreach that would\nresult from interpreting \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201coriginally from.\u201d\n  The extreme consequences of that interpretation are\nshown most dramatically by its potential application to or-\ndinary homeowners with septic tanks, a problem that the\nEPA highlighted in a recent Interpretive Statement. See\nInterpretive Statement on Application of the Clean Water\nAct NPDES Program to Releases of Pollutants From a Point\nSource to Groundwater, 84 Fed. Reg. 16824 (2019). Septic\nsystems\u2014used by 26 million American homes\u2014generally\noperate by \u201cdischarging liquid effluent into perforated pipes\nburied in a leach field, chambers, or other special units de-\nsigned to slowly release the effluent into the soil.\u201d Id., at\n16812. That effluent then percolates through the soil and\n\u201ccan in certain circumstances ultimately enter groundwa-\nter.\u201d Ibid.8 Congress most certainly did not intend that or-\ndinary homeowners with septic systems obtain NPDES\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 According to the EPA, numerous other conveyances that deposit pol-\n\nlutants into groundwater could now require NPDES permits. \u201cActivities\nlisted by commentators included aquifer recharge, leaks from sewage col-\nlection systems, . . . treatment systems such as constructed wetlands,\nspills and accidental releases, manure management, and coal ash\nimpoundment seepage.\u201d 84 Fed.

That, however, is where this alternative interpretation\nwould lead.\n   And the same is true for the test adopted by the Ninth\nCircuit. The Ninth Circuit held that a permit is required if\na pollutant that reaches navigable waters is \u201cfairly trace-\nable,\u201d but there is no real difference between \u201cfairly trace-\nable\u201d and \u201coriginally from.\u201d Unless a pollutant is \u201ctraceable\u201d\nto a point source, how could that point source be required\nto get a permit? And the addition of the qualifier \u201cfairly\u201d\ndoes not seem to add anything. What would it mean for a\npollutant to be \u201cunfairly traceable\u201d to a point source?\nTraceable only as a result of a method that is scientifically\nunsound? In that situation, why would a court consider the\npollutant to be traceable to the source in question at all? So\nif a pollutant can be reliably determined to have originally\ncome from a point source, a permit would appear to be re-\nquired under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test.\n   Respondents, instead of defending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation, argue that a discharge from a point source\nmust be the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of a pollutant\u2019s reaching\nnavigable waters. Brief for Respondents 12. But as the\nCourt concludes, ante, at 6, there is no basis for transplant-\ning this concept from the law of torts into the Clean Water\nAct, and it is unclear what it would mean in that context.\n   For these reasons, of the two possible interpretations of\nthe statutory terms, the better is the interpretation that\nreads \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201cdirectly from.\u201d\n                            C\n  Even if the Court were to find \u00a71362(12) ambiguous, ap-\nplicable clear statement rules foreclose the \u201cfunctional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nalso assert that respondents\u2019 theory would require permits for green in-\nfrastructure, water reuse, and groundwater discharge.

The\nCourt has required a clear statement of congressional in-\ntent when an administrative agency seeks to interpret a\nstatute in a way that entails \u201ca significant impingement of\nthe States\u2019 traditional and primary power over land and wa-\nter use,\u201d Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army\nCorps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 174 (2001) (SWANCC ),\nand when it adopts a new and expanded interpretation of a\nstatute, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302\n(2014) (UARG). The same rules should apply here where\nwhat is at issue is a new theory propounded by private\nplaintiffs.\n   First, the Court\u2019s \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d test unques-\ntionably impinges on the States\u2019 traditional authority. In\nSWANCC, the Court struck down the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 \u201cMigratory Bird Rule\u201d as inconsistent with the Clean\nWater Act because the rule effectively displaced state au-\nthority over land and water use. In this case, the federalism\ninterest is even stronger because the Clean Water Act itself\nassigns non-point-source-pollution regulation to the States\nand explicitly recognizes and protects the state role in envi-\nronmental protection. 33 U. S. C. \u00a71251(b). The \u201cfunctional\nequivalent\u201d standard expands federal point source regula-\ntion at the expense of state non-point source regulation.\nAnd as a practical matter, States would be saddled with the\ncosts of increased NPDES permitting (because States gen-\nerally award permits in place of the EPA), while exercising\ndiminished control over non-point source pollution within\ntheir territory. See Brief for State of West Virginia et al. as\nAmici Curiae 27\u201334.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s test offends the clear-statement rule\nrecognized in UARG by expanding the authority of the\nEPA. Congress must speak clearly if it \u201cwishes to assign to\nan agency decisions of vast \u2018economic and political signifi-\ncance.\u2019 \u201d 573 U. S., at 324 (quoting FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160 (2000)). In\n\f16      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nUARG, the EPA had promulgated greenhouse-gas emission\nstandards for stationary sources that \u201cconstitute[d] an \u2018un-\nprecedented expansion of EPA authority that would have a\nprofound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and\ntouch every household in the land.\u2019 \u201d 573 U. S., at 310\u2013311\n(quoting 73 Fed. Reg. 44355 (2008)). The statutory scheme,\ndesigned for large stationary sources like factories, would\nhave been extended to smaller sources like hotels and retail\nestablishments. The number of permits (and associated ex-\npenses) would have skyrocketed.\n  Here, as the EPA explained in a recent Interpretive\nStatement, the Fourth and Ninth Circuit \u201cdischarge\u201d\ntests\u2014which I struggle to distinguish from the \u201cfunctional\nequivalent\u201d formulation\u2014broaden the Act\u2019s coverage to\n\u201cpotentially swee[p] into the scope of the statute common-\nplace and ubiquitous activities such as releases from home-\nowners\u2019 backyard septic systems.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 16823.\n                               IV\n   The Court does little to justify its newfound standard,\nother than to point to certain past EPA enforcement ac-\ntions, see ante, at 8\u20139, 17, but the EPA\u2019s position on the\nregulation of groundwater has been anything but con-\nsistent. It is true, as the Court recounts, that the EPA has\nrequired NPDES permits for the discharge of some pollu-\ntants that migrate through groundwater before reaching\nnavigable waters. See ante, at 8\u20139. But the EPA has\ncontradicted itself on this important question multiple\ntimes. See Brief for Edison Electric Institute et al. as Amici\nCuriae 21\u201332 (reviewing EPA NPDES interpretations and\npermitting practices).\n   In the Act\u2019s earliest years, the EPA deputy general coun-\nsel wrote in a formal memorandum that \u201c[d]ischarges into\nground waters\u201d do not require NPDES permits.

Compare NPDES Permit\nRegulation and Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Stand-\nards for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations\n(CAFOs), 68 Fed. Reg. 7216 (2003), with 66 Fed. Reg. 3018\n(2001).\n  Similarly, in its 2019 Interpretive Statement, the EPA\nacknowledged its \u201c[l]ack of consistent and comprehensive\ndirection\u201d on this issue. See 84 Fed. Reg. 16820; see also\nBrief for Edison Electric Institute et al. as Amici Curiae 21\u2013\n32 (recounting EPA historical approach to NPDES permit-\nting). But it added that \u201cthe best, if not the only, reading of\nthe [Act] is that all releases to groundwater are excluded\nfrom the scope of the NPDES program, even where pollu-\ntants are conveyed to jurisdictional surface waters via\ngroundwater.\u201d 84 Fed. Reg. 16814.\n  In short, the EPA\u2019s inconsistent position on the ground-\nwater issue does not provide a sufficient basis for the\nCourt\u2019s new \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d test.\n                         *     *    *\n   The Court adopts a nebulous standard, enumerates a\nnon-exhaustive list of potentially relevant factors, and\nwashes its hands of the problem.

Argued November 6, 2019\u2014Decided April 23, 2020\nThe Clean Water Act forbids \u201cany addition\u201d of any pollutant from \u201cany\n  point source\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d without an appropriate permit\n  from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 502(12),\n  86 Stat. 844, 886. The Act defines \u201cpollutant\u201d broadly, \u00a7502(6); defines\n  a \u201cpoint source\u201d as \u201c \u2018any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance\n  . . . from which pollutants are or may be discharged,\u2019 \u201d including, e.g.,\n  any \u201c \u2018container,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018well,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(14); and defines the term \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d as \u201c \u2018any ad-\n  dition of any pollutant to navigable waters [including navigable\n  streams, rivers, the ocean, or coastal waters] from any point source,\u2019 \u201d\n  \u00a7502(12).

HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    direct discharge from a point source into navigable waters or when\n    there is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Pp. 4\u201318.\n       (a) Statutory context limits the reach of the phrase \u201cfrom any point\n    source\u201d to a range of circumstances narrower than that which the\n    Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d interpretation suggests. At the same\n    time, it is significantly broader than the total exclusion of all dis-\n    charges through groundwater, as urged by Maui and by the Solicitor\n    General as amicus curiae. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d limitation could allow EPA\n    to assert permitting authority over the release of pollutants that reach\n    navigable waters many years after their release. But Congress did not\n    intend to provide EPA with such broad authority. First, to interpret\n    \u201cfrom\u201d so broadly might require a permit in unexpected circumstances,\n    such as, e.g., the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250 miles of\n    groundwater to a river. Second, the statute\u2019s structure indicates that,\n    as to groundwater pollution and nonpoint source pollution, Congress\n    left substantial responsibility and autonomy to the States and did not\n    give EPA authority that could seriously interfere with this state re-\n    sponsibility. Third, the Act\u2019s legislative history strongly supports the\n    conclusion that the permitting provision does not extend so far. Fi-\n    nally, longstanding regulatory practice shows that EPA has success-\n    fully applied the permitting provision to pollution discharges from\n    point sources that reached navigable waters through groundwater\n    using a narrower interpretation than that of the Ninth Circuit. Pp. 5\u2013\n    10.\n       (c) Maui, the Government, and the two dissents argue for interpre-\n    tations that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purposes,\n    are also too extreme. Pp. 10\u201315.\n          (1) Maui and the Solicitor General argue that the statute\u2019s per-\n    mitting requirement does not apply if a pollutant, having emerged\n    from a \u201cpoint source,\u201d must travel through any amount of groundwater\n    before reaching navigable waters. That narrow interpretation would\n    risk serious interference with EPA\u2019s ability to regulate point source\n    discharges, and Congress would not have intended to create such a\n    large and obvious loophole in one of the Clean Water Act\u2019s key regula-\n    tory innovations. P. 10.\n          (2) Reading \u201cfrom\u201d in the phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d together\n    with \u201cconveyance\u201d in the point source definition \u201cany . . . conveyance,\u201d\n    Maui argues that the meaning of \u201cfrom any point source\u201d is not about\n    where the pollution originated, but about how it got there. Thus, Maui\n    claims, a permit is required only if a point source ultimately delivers\n    the pollutant to navigable waters. By contrast, if a pollutant travels\n    through groundwater, then the groundwater is the conveyance and no\n    permit is required. But Maui\u2019s definition of \u201cfrom\u201d as connoting a\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nmeans does not fit in context. Coupling \u201cfrom\u201d with \u201cto\u201d is strong evi-\ndence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnavigable wa-\nters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d). That Maui\u2019s reading would\ncreate a serious loophole in the permitting regime also indicates that\nit is unreasonable. Pp. 10\u201311.\n      (3) The Solicitor General argues that the proper interpretation of\nthe statute is the one reflected in EPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement,\nnamely, that \u201call releases of pollutants to groundwater\u201d are excluded\nfrom the scope of the permitting program, \u201ceven where pollutants are\nconveyed to jurisdictional surface waters via groundwater.\u201d 84 Fed.\nReg. 16810, 16811. That reading, which would open a loophole allow-\ning easy evasion of the statutory provision\u2019s basic purposes, is neither\npersuasive nor reasonable. EPA is correct that Congress did not re-\nquire a permit for all discharges to groundwater, and it did authorize\nstudy and funding related to groundwater pollution. But the most that\nthe study and funding provisions show is that Congress thought that\nthe problem of pollution in groundwater would primarily be addressed\nby the States or perhaps by other federal statutes. EPA\u2019s new inter-\npretation is also difficult to reconcile with the statute\u2019s reference to\n\u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable waters; with the statute\u2019s\ninclusion of \u201cwells\u201d in the \u201cpoint source\u201d definition, since wells would\nordinarily discharge pollutants through groundwater; and with statu-\ntory provisions that allow EPA to delegate its permitting authority to\na State only if the State, inter alia, provides \u201c \u2018adequate authority\u2019 \u201d to\n\u201c \u2018control the disposal of pollutants into wells,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7402(b). Pp. 11\u201313.\n      (4) Perhaps, as the dissents suggest, the statute\u2019s language could\nbe narrowed by reading the statute to refer only to the pollutant\u2019s im-\nmediate origin, but there is no linguistic basis for this limitation.\nPp. 13\u201315.\n    (d) The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim to provide federal\nregulation of identifiable sources of pollutants entering navigable wa-\nters without undermining the States\u2019 longstanding regulatory author-\nity over land and groundwater. The reading of the statute that best\ncaptures Congress\u2019 meaning, reflected in the statute\u2019s words, struc-\nture, and purposes, is that a permit is required when there is a dis-\ncharge from a point source directly into navigable waters or when\nthere is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. Many factors\nmay be relevant to determining whether a particular discharge is the\nfunctional equivalent of one directly into navigable waters. Time and\ndistance will be the most important factors in most cases, but other\nrelevant factors may include, e.g., the nature of the material through\nwhich the pollutant travels and the extent to which the pollutant is\ndiluted or chemically changed as it travels. Courts will provide addi-\ntional guidance through decisions in individual cases. The underlying\n\f4           COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statutory objectives can also provide guidance, and EPA can provide\n    administrative guidance. Although this interpretation does not pre-\n    sent as clear a line as the other interpretations proffered, the EPA has\n    applied the permitting provision to some discharges through ground-\n    water for over 30 years, with no evidence of inadministrability or an\n    unmanageable expansion in the statute\u2019s scope.

The word \u201cfrom\u201d is\nbroad in scope, but context often imposes limitations. \u201cFin-\nland,\u201d for example, is often not the right kind of answer to\nthe question, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d even if long ago\nyou were born there.\n   The parties here disagree dramatically about the scope of\nthe word \u201cfrom\u201d in the present context. The environmental\ngroups, the respondents, basically adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nview\u2014that the permitting requirement applies so long as\nthe pollutant is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to a point source even if it\ntraveled long and far (through groundwater) before it\nreached navigable waters.

Reiterating the position\ntaken in a recent EPA \u201cInterpretive Statement,\u201d see 84 Fed.\nReg. 16810 (2019), he argues that, given the Act\u2019s structure\nand history, \u201ca release of pollutants to groundwater is not\nsubject to\u201d the Act\u2019s permitting requirement \u201ceven if the\npollutants subsequently migrate to jurisdictional surface\nwaters,\u201d such as the ocean. Brief for United States as Ami-\ncus Curiae 12 (capitalization omitted).\n  We agree that statutory context limits the reach of the\nstatutory phrase \u201cfrom any point source\u201d to a range of cir-\ncumstances narrower than that which the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation suggests. At the same time, it is signifi-\ncantly broader than the total exclusion of all discharges\nthrough groundwater described by Maui and the Solicitor\nGeneral.\n                              III\n   Virtually all water, polluted or not, eventually makes its\nway to navigable water. This is just as true for groundwa-\nter. See generally 2 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Encyclopedia\n2600 (10th ed. 2008) (defining \u201cHydrology\u201d). Given the\npower of modern science, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s limitation,\n\u201cfairly traceable,\u201d may well allow EPA to assert permitting\nauthority over the release of pollutants that reach naviga-\nble waters many years after their release (say, from a well\nor pipe or compost heap) and in highly diluted forms. See,\ne.g., Brief for Aquatic Scientists et al. as Amici Curiae\n13\u201328.\n   The respondents suggest that the standard can be nar-\nrowed by adding a \u201cproximate cause\u201d requirement. That is,\nto fall within the permitting provision, the discharge from\n\f6       COUNTY OF MAUI v.

But the term \u201cprox-\nimate cause\u201d derives from general tort law, and it takes on\nits specific content based primarily on \u201cpolicy\u201d considera-\ntions. See CSX Transp., Inc. v.

In the context of water pollution,\nwe do not see how it significantly narrows the statute be-\nyond the words \u201cfairly traceable\u201d themselves.\n   Our view is that Congress did not intend the point source-\npermitting requirement to provide EPA with such broad au-\nthority as the Ninth Circuit\u2019s narrow focus on traceability\nwould allow. First, to interpret the word \u201cfrom\u201d in this lit-\neral way would require a permit in surprising, even bizarre,\ncircumstances, such as for pollutants carried to navigable\nwaters on a bird\u2019s feathers, or, to mention more mundane\ninstances, the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250\nmiles of groundwater to a river.\n   Second, and perhaps most important, the structure of the\nstatute indicates that, as to groundwater pollution and non-\npoint source pollution, Congress intended to leave substan-\ntial responsibility and autonomy to the States. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7101(b), 86 Stat. 816 (stating Congress\u2019 purpose in this re-\ngard). Much water pollution does not come from a readily\nidentifiable source. See 3 Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Ency-\nclopedia, at 5801 (defining \u201cWater Pollution\u201d). Rainwater,\nfor example, can carry pollutants (say, as might otherwise\ncollect on a roadway); it can pollute groundwater, and pol-\nlution collected by unchanneled rainwater runoff is not or-\ndinarily considered point source pollution. Over many dec-\nades, and with federal encouragement, the States have\ndeveloped methods of regulating nonpoint source pollution\nthrough water quality standards, and otherwise.

Although the Act grants\nEPA specific authority to regulate certain point source pol-\nlution (it can also delegate some of this authority to the\nStates acting under EPA supervision, see \u00a7402(b), 86 Stat.\n880), these permitting provisions refer to \u201cpoint sources\u201d\nand \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d and say nothing at all about non-\npoint source regulation or groundwater regulation. We\nmust doubt that Congress intended to give EPA the author-\nity to apply the word \u201cfrom\u201d in a way that could interfere as\nseriously with States\u2019 traditional regulatory authority\u2014au-\nthority the Act preserves and promotes\u2014as the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d test would.\n   Third, those who look to legislative history to help inter-\npret a statute will find that this Act\u2019s history strongly\nsupports our conclusion that the permitting provision does not\nextend so far. Fifty years ago, when Congress was consid-\nering the bills that became the Clean Water Act, William\nRuckelshaus, the first EPA Administrator, asked Congress\nto grant EPA authority over \u201cground waters\u201d to \u201cassure that\n\f8        COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Representative Les Aspin similarly\npointed out that there were \u201cconspicuou[s ]\u201d references to\ngroundwater in all sections of the bill except the permitting\nsection at issue here. Water Pollution Control Legislation\u2013\n1971: Hearings before the House Committee on Public\nWorks on H. R. 11896 and H. R. 11895, 92d Cong., 1st Sess.,\n727 (1972).

No. 92\u2013414, p. 73 (1971).\n   But Congress did not accept these requests for general\nEPA authority over groundwater. It rejected Representa-\ntive Aspin\u2019s amendment that would have extended the per-\nmitting provision to groundwater. Instead, Congress pro-\nvided a set of more specific groundwater-related measures\nsuch as those requiring States to maintain \u201caffirmative con-\ntrols over the injection or placement in wells\u201d of \u201cany pollu-\ntants that may affect ground water.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span> These specific\nstate-related </span><pre class=\"inline\">programs were, in the words of the Senate\nPublic Works Committee, \u201cdesigned to protect ground wa-\nters and eliminate the use of deep well disposal as an un-\ncontrolled alternative to toxic and pollution control.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span>\nThe upshot is </span><pre class=\"inline\">that Congress was fully aware of the need to\naddress groundwater pollution, but it satisfied that need\nthrough a variety of state-specific controls.

But this history, by showing that\na comparatively narrow view of the statute is administra-\ntively workable, offers some additional support for the view\nthat Congress did not intend as broad a delegation of regu-\nlatory authority as the Ninth Circuit test would allow.\n   As we have said, the specific meaning of the word \u201cfrom\u201d\n\f10        COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessarily draws its meaning from context. The apparent\nbreadth of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cfairly traceable\u201d approach is\ninconsistent with the context we have just described.\n                              IV\n                               A\n  Maui and the Solicitor General argue that the statute\u2019s\npermitting requirement does not apply if a pollutant, hav-\ning emerged from a \u201cpoint source,\u201d must travel through any\namount of groundwater before reaching navigable waters.\nThat interpretation is too narrow, for it would risk serious\ninterference with EPA\u2019s ability to regulate ordinary point\nsource discharges.\n  Consider a pipe that spews pollution directly into coastal\nwaters. There is an \u201caddition of \u201d a \u201cpollutant to navigable\nwaters from [a] point source.\u201d Hence, a permit is required.\nBut Maui and the Government read the permitting require-\nment not to apply if there is any amount of groundwater\nbetween the end of the pipe and the edge of the navigable\nwater. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136, 24\u201325. If that is the correct\ninterpretation of the statute, then why could not the pipe\u2019s\nowner, seeking to avoid the permit requirement, simply\nmove the pipe back, perhaps only a few yards, so that the\npollution must travel through at least some groundwater\nbefore reaching the sea?

That language requires a permit for a \u201cdischarge.\u201d\nA \u201cdischarge\u201d is \u201cany addition\u201d of a pollutant to navigable\nwaters \u201cfrom any point source.\u201d And a \u201cpoint source\u201d is \u201cany\ndiscernible, confined and discrete conveyance\u201d (such as a\npipe, ditch, well, etc.). Reading \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cconveyance\u201d to-\ngether, Maui argues that the statutory meaning of \u201cfrom\nany point source\u201d is not about where the pollution origi-\nnated, but about how it got there. Under what Maui calls\nthe means-of-delivery test, a permit is required only if a\npoint source itself ultimately delivers the pollutant to nav-\nigable waters. Under this view, if the pollutant must travel\nthrough groundwater to reach navigable waters, then it is\nthe groundwater, not the pipe, that is the conveyance.\n  Congress sometimes adopts less common meanings of\ncommon words, but this esoteric definition of \u201cfrom,\u201d as con-\nnoting a means, does not remotely fit in this context. The\nstatute couples the word \u201cfrom\u201d with the word \u201cto\u201d\u2014strong\nevidence that Congress was referring to a destination (\u201cnav-\nigable waters\u201d) and an origin (\u201cany point source\u201d).

That Maui\u2019s proffered interpre-\ntation would also create a serious loophole in the permitting\nregime also indicates it is an unreasonable one.\n                              C\n   The Solicitor General agrees that, as a general matter,\nthe permitting requirement applies to at least some addi-\ntions of pollutants to navigable waters that come indirectly\nfrom point sources. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 33\u201335. But the Solicitor General argues that the\nproper interpretation of the statute is the one reflected in\nEPA\u2019s recent Interpretive Statement.

Indeed, the expansive language of the provision\u2014any\naddition from any point source\u2014strongly suggests its scope\nis not so limited.\n   JUSTICE ALITO appears to believe that there are only two\npossible ways to read \u201cfrom\u201d: as referring either to the im-\nmediate source, or else to the original source. Post, at 5, 8.\nBecause he agrees that the statute cannot reasonably be\nread always to reach the original source, he concludes the\nstatute must refer only to the immediate origin. But as the\nforegoing example illustrates, context may indicate that\n\u201cfrom\u201d includes an intermediate stop\u2014Baltimore, not Eu-\nrope or the train station.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS relies on the word \u201caddition,\u201d but we fail\nto see how that word limits the statute to discharges di-\nrectly to navigable waters. Ordinary language abounds in\ncounter examples: A recipe might instruct to \u201cadd the drip-\npings from the meat to the gravy\u201d; that instruction does not\nbecome incomprehensible, or even peculiar, simply because\nthe drippings will have first collected in a pan or on a cut-\nting board. And while it would be an unusual phrasing (as\nstatutory phrasings often are), we do not see how the rec-\nipe\u2019s meaning would transform if it instead said to \u201cadd the\ndrippings to the gravy from the meat.\u201d To take another ex-\nample: If Timmy is told to \u201cadd water to the bath from the\nwell\u201d he will know just what it means\u2014even though he will\nhave to use a bucket to complete the task.\n   And although JUSTICE THOMAS resists the inevitable im-\nplications of his reading of the statute, post, at 5\u20136, that\nreading would create the same loopholes as those offered by\nthe petitioner and the Government, and more. It would nec-\nessarily exclude a pipe that drains onto the beach next to\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

It also seems to exclude a pipe that hangs out over\nthe water and adds pollutants to the air, through which the\npollutants fall to navigable waters. The absurdity of such\nan interpretation is obvious enough.\n  We therefore reject this reading as well: Like Maui\u2019s and\nthe Government\u2019s, it is inconsistent with the statutory text\nand simultaneously creates a massive loophole in the per-\nmitting scheme that Congress established.\n                              E\n  For the reasons set forth in Part III and in this Part, we\nconclude that, in light of the statute\u2019s language, structure,\nand purposes, the interpretations offered by the parties, the\nGovernment, and the dissents are too extreme.\n                              V\n  Over the years, courts and EPA have tried to find general\nlanguage that will reflect a middle ground between these\nextremes. The statute\u2019s words reflect Congress\u2019 basic aim\nto provide federal regulation of identifiable sources of pol-\nlutants entering navigable waters without undermining the\nStates\u2019 longstanding regulatory authority over land and\ngroundwater. We hold that the statute requires a permit\nwhen there is a direct discharge from a point source into\nnavigable waters or when there is the functional equivalent\nof a direct discharge. We think this phrase best captures,\nin broad terms, those circumstances in which Congress in-\ntended to require a federal permit. That is, an addition falls\nwithin the statutory requirement that it be \u201cfrom any point\nsource\u201d when a point source directly deposits pollutants\ninto navigable waters, or when the discharge reaches the\nsame result through roughly similar means.\n  Time and distance are obviously important. Where a pipe\nends a few feet from navigable waters and the pipe emits\npollutants that travel those few feet through groundwater\n\f16      COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(or over the beach), the permitting requirement clearly ap-\nplies. If the pipe ends 50 miles from navigable waters and\nthe pipe emits pollutants that travel with groundwater, mix\nwith much other material, and end up in navigable waters\nonly many years later, the permitting requirements likely\ndo not apply.\n   The object in a given scenario will be to advance, in a\nmanner consistent with the statute\u2019s language, the statu-\ntory purposes that Congress sought to achieve. As we have\nsaid (repeatedly), the word \u201cfrom\u201d seeks a \u201cpoint source\u201d\norigin, and context imposes natural limits as to when a\npoint source can properly be considered the origin of pollu-\ntion that travels through groundwater. That context in-\ncludes the need, reflected in the statute, to preserve state\nregulation of groundwater and other nonpoint sources of\npollution. Whether pollutants that arrive at navigable wa-\nters after traveling through groundwater are \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource depends upon how similar to (or different from) the\nparticular discharge is to a direct discharge.\n   The difficulty with this approach, we recognize, is that it\ndoes not, on its own, clearly explain how to deal with middle\ninstances. But there are too many potentially relevant fac-\ntors applicable to factually different cases for this Court\nnow to use more specific language. Consider, for example,\njust some of the factors that may prove relevant (depending\nupon the circumstances of a particular case): (1) transit\ntime, (2) distance traveled, (3) the nature of the material\nthrough which the pollutant travels, (4) the extent to which\nthe pollutant is diluted or chemically changed as it travels,\n(5) the amount of pollutant entering the navigable waters\nrelative to the amount of the pollutant that leaves the point\nsource, (6) the manner by or area in which the pollutant\nenters the navigable waters, (7) the degree to which the pol-\nlution (at that point) has maintained its specific identity.\nTime and distance will be the most important factors in\nmost cases, but not necessarily every case.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the same time, courts can provide guidance through\ndecisions in individual cases. The Circuits have tried to do\nso, often using general language somewhat similar to the\nlanguage we have used. And the traditional common-law\nmethod, making decisions that provide examples that in\nturn lead to ever more refined principles, is sometimes use-\nful, even in an era of statutes.\n   The underlying statutory objectives also provide guid-\nance. Decisions should not create serious risks either of un-\ndermining state regulation of groundwater or of creating\nloopholes that undermine the statute\u2019s basic federal regu-\nlatory objectives.\n   EPA, too, can provide administrative guidance (within\nstatutory boundaries) in numerous ways, including\nthrough, for example, grants of individual permits, promul-\ngation of general permits, or the development of general\nrules. Indeed, over the years, EPA and the States have of-\nten considered the Act\u2019s application to discharges through\ngroundwater.\n   Both Maui and the Government object that to subject dis-\ncharges to navigable waters through groundwater to the\nstatute\u2019s permitting requirements, as our interpretation\nwill sometimes do, would vastly expand the scope of the\nstatute, perhaps requiring permits for each of the 650,000\nwells like petitioner\u2019s or for each of the over 20 million sep-\ntic systems used in many Americans\u2019 homes.

In that case, Justice Scalia stated that polluters could\nnot \u201cevade the permitting requirement of \u00a71342(a) simply\nby discharging their pollutants into noncovered intermit-\ntent watercourses that lie upstream of covered waters.\u201d 547\n\f2       COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Justice Scalia reasoned that the Clean\nWater Act does not merely \u201cforbid the \u2018addition of any pol-\nlutant directly to navigable waters from any point source,\u2019\nbut rather the \u2018addition of any pollutant to navigable wa-\nters.\u2019 Thus, from the time of the CWA\u2019s enactment, lower\ncourts have held that the discharge into intermittent chan-\nnels of any pollutant that naturally washes downstream\nlikely violates \u00a71311(a), even if the pollutants discharged\nfrom a point source do not emit \u2018directly into\u2019 covered wa-\nters, but pass \u2018through conveyances\u2019 in between.\u201d</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145642\"> <a href=\"/opinion/145642/rapanos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\"></pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span></span> at 743\n</span><pre class=\"inline\"></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(citations omitted).\n   In other words, under Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation in\nRapanos, the fact that the pollutants from Maui\u2019s\nwastewater facility reach the ocean via an indirect route\ndoes not itself exempt Maui\u2019s facility from the Clean Water\nAct\u2019s permitting requirement for point sources. The Court\ntoday adheres to Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis in Rapanos on\nthat issue.\n   Second, as Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Rapanos pointed\nout and as the Court\u2019s opinion today explains, the statute\ndoes not establish a bright-line test regarding when a pol-\nlutant may be considered to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a point\nsource.

The CWA defines a \u201cdischarge\u201d as \u201cany\naddition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any\npoint source.\u201d \u00a71362(12).1 Based on the statutory text and\nstructure, I would hold that a permit is required only when\na point source discharges pollutants directly into navigable\nwaters. The Court adopts this interpretation in part, con-\ncluding that a permit is required for \u201ca direct discharge.\u201d\nAnte, at 15. But the Court then departs from the statutory\ntext by requiring a permit for \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge,\u201d ibid., which it defines through an open-\nended inquiry into congressional intent and practical con-\nsiderations.

It defines a \u201cpoint\nsource\u201d as \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including\nbut not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete\nfissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation,\nor vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be dis-\ncharged,\u201d excluding \u201cagricultural stormwater discharges and return\nflows from irrigated agriculture.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v.

Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary defines \u201caddition\u201d as \u201cthe act or process of adding:\nthe joining or uniting of one thing to another.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 24 (1961); see also</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">ibid.</span>\n(listing \u201cincrease\u201d and </span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201caugmentation\u201d as synonyms for \u201cad-\ndition\u201d). Other dictionary definitions from around the time\nof the statute\u2019s enactment are in accord. See, e.g., American\nHeritage Dictionary 14, 15 (1981) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he act or process of adding\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as \u201c[t]o\njoin or unite so as to increase in size, quantity, or scope\u201d);\nsee also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 29, 30 (2d\ned. 1957) (defining \u201caddition\u201d as the \u201c[a]ct, process, or in-\nstance of adding,\u201d and defining \u201cadd\u201d as to \u201cjoin or unite, as\none thing to another, or as several particulars, so as to in-\ncrease the number, augment the quantity, enlarge the mag-\nnitude, or so as to form into one aggregate\u201d).\n   The inclusion of the term \u201caddition\u201d in the CWA indicates\nthat the statute excludes anything other than a direct dis-\ncharge. When a point source releases pollutants to ground-\nwater, one would naturally say that the groundwater has\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. If\nthe pollutants eventually reach navigable waters, one\nwould not naturally say that the navigable waters have\nbeen augmented with pollutants from the point source. The\naugmentation instead occurs with pollutants from the\ngroundwater.\n   The prepositions \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d reinforce this reading.\nWhen pollutants are released from a point source to another\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npoint source or groundwater, they are added to the second\nfrom the first. If the pollutants are later released to navi-\ngable waters, they are added to the navigable waters from\nthe second point source or the groundwater. One would not\nnaturally say that the pollutants are added to the navigable\nwaters from the original point source.\n   Interpreting \u201cdischarge\u201d to mean a direct discharge\nmakes sense of other parts of the definition as well. It re-\nspects the statutory definition of a point source as a \u201ccon-\nveyance,\u201d see \u00a71362(14), because a point source that re-\nleases pollutants directly into navigable waters is a means\nof conveyance. And it makes sense of the word \u201cany\u201d before\n\u201cpoint source,\u201d because that term clarifies that any kind of\npoint source may require a permit.\n   The structure of the CWA confirms this interpretation. It\nauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to\nregulate discharges from point sources, including through\nthe permitting process, but it reserves to the States the pri-\nmary responsibility for regulating other sources of pollu-\ntion, including groundwater. With respect to these sources,\nthe EPA merely collects information, coordinates with the\nStates, and provides funding.

Thus, construing the EPA\u2019s power to regulate\npoint sources to allow the agency to regulate nonpoint\nsources and groundwater is in serious tension with Con-\ngress\u2019 design.\n   My reading is also consistent with our decision in South\nFla.

Here, however, the Court makes up a rule\nthat provides no clear guidance and invites arbitrary and\ninconsistent application.\n  The text of the Clean Water Act generally requires a per-\nmit when a discharge \u201cfrom\u201d a \u201cpoint source\u201d (such as a\npipe) \u201cadd[s]\u201d a pollutant \u201cto\u201d navigable waters (such as the\nPacific Ocean). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71362(12). There are two ways\nto read this text. A pollutant that reaches the ocean could\nbe understood to have been added \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if the\npipe originally discharged the pollutant and the pollutant\neventually made its way to the ocean by flowing over or un-\nder the surface of the ground. Or a pollutant that reaches\nthe ocean could be understood to have come \u201cfrom\u201d a pipe if\nthe pollutant is discharged from the pipe directly into the\nocean.\n  There is no comprehensible alternative to these two\ninterpretations, but the Court refuses to accept either.\nBoth alternatives, it believes, lead to unacceptable results,\nand it therefore tries to find a middle way. It holds that a\npermit is required \u201cwhen there is a direct discharge from a\npoint source into navigable waters or when there is the\n\f2        COUNTY OF MAUI v.

The Court provides no real answer. All it will say\nis that the distance a pollutant travels and the time this\ntrip entails are the most important factors, but at least five\nother factors may have a bearing on the question, and even\nthis list is not exhaustive. Ante, at 16. Entities like water\ntreatment authorities that need to know whether they must\nget a permit are left to guess how this nebulous standard\nwill be applied. Regulators are given the discretion, at least\nin the first instance, to make of this standard what they\nwill. And the lower courts?

Specifically, they agree\nthat: The effluent emitted by the wells is a \u201cpollutant\u201d; this\neffluent reaches navigable waters (the Pacific Ocean); and\nthe wells are \u201cpoint source[s].\u201d The disputed question is\nwhether the emission of effluent from those wells qualifies\nas a \u201cdischarge,\u201d that is, the addition of a pollutant \u201cfrom\u201d\na point source. \u00a71362(12) (emphasis added).\n   There are two possible interpretations of this phrase.\nThe first is that pollutants are added to navigable waters\nfrom a point source whenever they originally came from the\npoint source. The second is that pollutants are added to\nnavigable waters only if they were discharged from a point\nsource directly into navigable waters.\n   Dissatisfied with those options, the Court tries to find a\nthird, but its interpretation is very hard to fit into the stat-\nutory text. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, it appears\nthat a pollutant that leaves a point source and heads to-\nward navigable waters via some non-point source (such as\nby flowing over the ground or by means of groundwater) is\n\u201cfrom\u201d the point source for some portion of its journey, but\nonce it has travelled a certain distance or once a certain\namount of time has elapsed, it is no longer \u201cfrom\u201d the point\nsource and is instead \u201cfrom\u201d a non-point source.\n   This is an implausible reading of the statute. The Court\nhas many inventive examples of the different meanings\nthat can be conveyed by the simple statement that A comes\nfrom B, but one of the Court\u2019s examples\u2014the traveler who\n\f6       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nflies from Europe to Baltimore\u2014illustrates the problem. If\nwe apply the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71362 to this trav-\neler\u2019s journey, he would be \u201cfrom\u201d Europe for the first part\nof the flight, but at some point he might cease to be \u201cfrom\u201d\nEurope and would then be from someplace else, maybe\nGreenland or geographical coordinates in the middle of the\nAtlantic. This is a very strange notion, and therefore, I\nthink the statutory text compels us to choose between the\ntwo alternatives set out above.\n   The Court rejects both of these because it thinks they lead\nto unacceptably extreme results. \u201cOriginally from\u201d would\nimpose liability even if pollutants discharged into ground\nwater had to travel 250 miles over the course of 100 years\nbefore reaching navigable waters. See ante, at 6. And \u201c \u2018im-\nmediately\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018directly\u2019 from,\u201d the Court thinks, would\nmean that a polluter could evade the permit requirement\nby discharging pollutants from a pipe located just a few feet\nfrom navigable waters. Ante, at 14\u201315.\n   To escape these possibilities, the Court devises its own\ntest: A permit is required, the Court holds, \u201cwhen there is a\ndirect discharge from a point source into navigable waters\nor when there is the functional equivalent of a direct dis-\ncharge.\u201d Ante, at 15 (emphasis in original). The Clean Wa-\nter Act, however, says nothing about \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent\u201d of a direct discharge. That is the Court\u2019s own\nconcoction, and the Court provides no clear explanation of\nits meaning.\n   The term \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d may have a quasi-\ntechnical ring, but what does it mean? \u201cEquivalent\u201d means\n\u201cequal\u201d in some respect, and \u201cfunctional\u201d signifies a rela-\ntionship to a function. The function of a direct discharge\nfrom a point source into navigable waters is to convey the\nentirety of the discharge into navigable waters without any\ndelay. Therefore, the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a direct dis-\ncharge of a pollutant into navigable waters would seem to\nbe a discharge that is equal to a direct discharge in these\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nrespects.\n   If that is what the Court meant by \u201cthe functional equiv-\nalent of a direct discharge,\u201d the test would apply at best to\nonly a small set of situations not involving a direct dis-\ncharge. The Court\u2019s example of a pipe that emits pollutants\na few feet from the ocean would presumably qualify on de\nminimis grounds, but if the pipe were moved back any\nsignificant distance, the discharge would not be exactly\nequal to a direct discharge. There would be some lag from\nthe time of the discharge to the time when the pollutant\nreaches navigable waters; some of the pollutant might not\nreach that destination; and the pollutant might have\nchanged somewhat in composition by the time it reached\nthe navigable waters.\n   For these reasons, the Court\u2019s reference to \u201cthe functional\nequivalent of a direct discharge,\u201d if taken literally, would be\nof little importance, but the Court\u2019s understanding of this\nconcept is very different from the literal meaning of the\nphrase. As used by the Court, \u201cthe functional equivalent of\na direct discharge\u201d means a discharge that is sufficiently\nsimilar to a direct discharge to warrant a permit in light of\nthe Clean Water Act\u2019s \u201clanguage, structure, and purposes.\u201d\nSee ante, at 18. But what, in concrete terms, does this\nmean? How similar is sufficiently similar?\n   The Court provides this guidance. It explains that time\nand distance are the most important factors, ante, at 16, but\nit does not set any time or distance limits except to observe\nthat a permit is needed where the discharge is a few feet\naway from navigable waters and that a permit is not re-\nquired where the discharge is far away and it takes \u201cmany\nyears\u201d for the pollutants to complete the journey. Ante, at\n15\u201316. Beyond this, the Court provides a list (and a non-\nexhaustive one at that!) of five other factors that may be\nrelevant: \u201cthe nature of the material through which the pol-\nlutant travels,\u201d \u201cthe extent to which the pollutant is diluted\n\f8       COUNTY OF MAUI v. HAWAII WILDLIFE FUND\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nor chemically changed as it travels,\u201d \u201cthe amount of pollu-\ntant entering the navigable waters relative to the amount\nof the pollutant that leaves the point source,\u201d \u201cthe manner\nby or area in which the pollutant enters the navigable wa-\nters,\u201d and \u201cthe degree to which the pollution (at that point)\nhas maintained its specific identity.\u201d Ante, at 16.\n   The Court admits that its rule \u201cdoes not, on its own,\nclearly explain how to deal with middle instances,\u201d ibid.,\nbut that admission does not go far enough. How the rule\napplies to \u201cmiddle instances\u201d is anybody\u2019s guess. Except in\nextreme cases, dischargers will be able to argue that the\nCourt\u2019s multifactor test does not require a permit. Oppo-\nnents will be able to make the opposite argument. Regula-\ntors will be able to justify whatever result they prefer in a\nparticular case. And judges will be left at sea.\n                              III\n                               A\n   Instead of concocting our own rule, I would interpret the\nwords of the statute, and in my view, the better of the two\npossible interpretations is that a permit is required when a\npollutant is discharged directly from a point source to nav-\nigable waters. This interpretation is consistent with the\nstatutory language and better fits the overall scheme of the\nClean Water Act. And properly understood, it does not have\nthe sort of extreme consequences that the Court finds\nunacceptable.\n   Take the Court\u2019s example of a pipe that discharges pollu-\ntants a short distance from the ocean.

I would describe that\ndischarge as direct because point source B discharges directly into cov-\nered waters, but the difference is purely semantic.\n   6 As we have said, the Act\u2019s point-source \u201cdefinition makes plain that a\n\npoint source need not be the original source of the pollutant; it need only\nconvey the pollutant to \u2018navigable waters,\u2019 which are, in turn, defined as\n\u2018the waters of the United States.\u2019 \u201d South Fla.

See\nInterpretive Statement on Application of the Clean Water\nAct NPDES Program to Releases of Pollutants From a Point\nSource to Groundwater, 84 Fed. Reg. 16824 (2019).

That, however, is where this alternative interpretation\nwould lead.\n   And the same is true for the test adopted by the Ninth\nCircuit. The Ninth Circuit held that a permit is required if\na pollutant that reaches navigable waters is \u201cfairly trace-\nable,\u201d but there is no real difference between \u201cfairly trace-\nable\u201d and \u201coriginally from.\u201d Unless a pollutant is \u201ctraceable\u201d\nto a point source, how could that point source be required\nto get a permit? And the addition of the qualifier \u201cfairly\u201d\ndoes not seem to add anything. What would it mean for a\npollutant to be \u201cunfairly traceable\u201d to a point source?\nTraceable only as a result of a method that is scientifically\nunsound? In that situation, why would a court consider the\npollutant to be traceable to the source in question at all? So\nif a pollutant can be reliably determined to have originally\ncome from a point source, a permit would appear to be re-\nquired under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test.\n   Respondents, instead of defending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ninterpretation, argue that a discharge from a point source\nmust be the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of a pollutant\u2019s reaching\nnavigable waters. Brief for Respondents 12. But as the\nCourt concludes, ante, at 6, there is no basis for transplant-\ning this concept from the law of torts into the Clean Water\nAct, and it is unclear what it would mean in that context.\n   For these reasons, of the two possible interpretations of\nthe statutory terms, the better is the interpretation that\nreads \u201cfrom\u201d to mean \u201cdirectly from.\u201d\n                            C\n  Even if the Court were to find \u00a71362(12) ambiguous, ap-\nplicable clear statement rules foreclose the \u201cfunctional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nalso assert that respondents\u2019 theory would require permits for green in-\nfrastructure, water reuse, and groundwater discharge.

Argued January 14, 2020\u2014Decided April 23, 2020\nRomag Fasteners, Inc., and Fossil, Inc., signed an agreement to use Ro-\n  mag\u2019s fasteners in Fossil\u2019s leather goods. Romag eventually discovered\n  that factories in China making Fossil products were using counterfeit\n  Romag fasteners. Romag sued Fossil and certain retailers of Fossil\n  products (collectively, Fossil) for trademark infringement pursuant to\n  15 U. S. C. \u00a71125(a). Relying on Second Circuit precedent, the district\n  court rejected Romag\u2019s request for an award of profits, because the\n  jury, while finding that Fossil had acted callously, rejected Romag\u2019s\n  accusation that Fossil had acted willfully.\nHeld: A plaintiff in a trademark infringement suit is not required to show\n that a defendant willfully infringed the plaintiff\u2019s trademark as a pre-\n condition to a profits award. The Lanham Act provision governing\n remedies for trademark violations, \u00a71117(a), makes a showing of will-\n fulness a precondition to a profits award in a suit under \u00a71125(c) for\n trademark dilution, but \u00a71125(a) has never required such a showing.\n Reading words into a statute should be avoided, especially when they\n are included elsewhere in the very same statute. That absence seems\n all the more telling here, where the Act speaks often, expressly, and\n with considerable care about mental states. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71117(b), (c),\n 1118. Pointing to \u00a71117(a)\u2019s language indicating that a violation under\n \u00a71125(a) can trigger an award of the defendant\u2019s profits \u201csubject to the\n principles of equity,\u201d Fossil argues that equity courts historically re-\n quired a showing of willfulness before authorizing a profits remedy in\n trademark disputes. But this suggestion relies on the curious assump-\n tion that Congress intended to incorporate a willfulness requirement\n here obliquely while it prescribed mens rea conditions expressly else-\n\f2              ROMAG FASTENERS, INC. v.

A district court may\naward a winning plaintiff injunctive relief, damages, or the\ndefendant\u2019s ill-gotten profits. Without question, a defend-\nant\u2019s state of mind may have a bearing on what relief a\nplaintiff should receive. An innocent trademark violator\noften stands in very different shoes than an intentional one.\nBut some circuits have gone further. These courts hold a\nplaintiff can win a profits remedy, in particular, only after\nshowing the defendant willfully infringed its trademark.\nThe question before us is whether that categorical rule can\nbe reconciled with the statute\u2019s plain language.\n  The question comes to us in a case involving handbag\nfasteners. Romag sells magnetic snap fasteners for use in\nleather goods. Fossil designs, markets, and distributes a\nwide range of fashion accessories. Years ago, the pair\nsigned an agreement allowing Fossil to use Romag\u2019s fasten-\ners in Fossil\u2019s handbags and other products. Initially, both\nsides seemed content with the arrangement. But in time\nRomag discovered that the factories Fossil hired in China\n\f2           ROMAG FASTENERS, INC. v. FOSSIL, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto make its products were using counterfeit Romag fasten-\ners\u2014and that Fossil was doing little to guard against the\npractice. Unable to resolve its concerns amicably, Romag\nsued. The company alleged that Fossil had infringed its\ntrademark and falsely represented that its fasteners came\nfrom Romag. After trial, a jury agreed with Romag, and\nfound that Fossil had acted \u201cin callous disregard\u201d of Ro-\nmag\u2019s rights. At the same time, however, the jury rejected\nRomag\u2019s accusation that Fossil had acted willfully, as that\nterm was defined by the district court.\n  For our purposes, the last finding is the important one.\nBy way of relief for Fossil\u2019s trademark violation, Romag\nsought (among other things) an order requiring Fossil to\nhand over the profits it had earned thanks to its trademark\nviolation. But the district court refused this request. The\ncourt pointed out that controlling Second Circuit precedent\nrequires a plaintiff seeking a profits award to prove that the\ndefendant\u2019s violation was willful. Not all circuits, however,\nagree with the Second Circuit\u2019s rule. We took this case to\nresolve that dispute over the law\u2019s demands. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019).\n  Where does Fossil\u2019s proposed willfulness rule come from?\nThe relevant section of the Lanham Act governing remedies\nfor trademark violations, \u00a735, 60 Stat. 439\u2013440, as\namended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71117(a), says this:\n         \u201cWhen a violation of any right of the registrant of a\n      mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, a\n      violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this title, or a\n      willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title, shall\n      have been established . . . , the plaintiff shall be enti-\n      tled, subject to the provisions of sections 1111 and 1114\n      of this title, and subject to the principles of equity, to\n      recover (1) defendant\u2019s profits, (2) any damages sus-\n      tained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action.\u201d\n    Immediately, this language spells trouble for Fossil and\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe circuit precedent on which it relies. The statute does\nmake a showing of willfulness a precondition to a profits\naward when the plaintiff proceeds under \u00a71125(c). That\nsection, added to the Lanham Act some years after its\ninitial adoption, creates a cause of action for trademark\ndilution\u2014conduct that lessens the association consumers\nhave with a trademark. But Romag alleged and proved a\nviolation of \u00a71125(a), a provision establishing a cause of ac-\ntion for the false or misleading use of trademarks. And in\ncases like that, the statutory language has never required a\nshowing of willfulness to win a defendant\u2019s profits. Yes, the\nlaw tells us that a profits award is subject to limitations\nfound in \u00a7\u00a71111 and 1114. But no one suggests those cross-\nreferenced sections contain the rule Fossil seeks. Nor does\nthis Court usually read into statutes words that aren\u2019t\nthere. It\u2019s a temptation we are doubly careful to avoid when\nCongress has (as here) included the term in question else-\nwhere in the very same statutory provision.\n   A wider look at the statute\u2019s structure gives us even more\nreason for pause. The Lanham Act speaks often and ex-\npressly about mental states. Section 1117(b) requires\ncourts to treble profits or damages and award attorney\u2019s\nfees when a defendant engages in certain acts intentionally\nand with specified knowledge. Section 1117(c) increases the\ncap on statutory damages from $200,000 to $2,000,000 for\ncertain willful violations. Section 1118 permits courts to\norder the infringing items be destroyed if a plaintiff proves\nany violation of \u00a71125(a) or a willful violation of \u00a71125(c).\nSection 1114 makes certain innocent infringers subject only\nto injunctions. Elsewhere, the statute specifies certain\nmens rea standards needed to establish liability, before\neven getting to the question of remedies. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a71125(d)(1)(A)(i), (B)(i) (prohibiting certain conduct only if\nundertaken with \u201cbad faith intent\u201d and listing nine factors\nrelevant to ascertaining bad faith intent). Without doubt,\nthe Lanham Act exhibits considerable care with mens rea\n\f4          ROMAG FASTENERS, INC. v. FOSSIL, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstandards. The absence of any such standard in the provi-\nsion before us, thus, seems all the more telling.\n   So how exactly does Fossil seek to conjure a willfulness\nrequirement out of \u00a71117(a)? Lacking any more obvious\nstatutory hook, the company points to the language indicat-\ning that a violation under \u00a71125(a) can trigger an award of\nthe defendant\u2019s profits \u201csubject to the principles of equity.\u201d\nIn Fossil\u2019s telling, equity courts historically required a\nshowing of willfulness before authorizing a profits remedy\nin trademark disputes. Admittedly, equity courts didn\u2019t\nrequire so much in patent infringement cases and other\narguably analogous suits. See, e.g., Dowagiac Mfg. Co. v.\nMinnesota Moline Plow Co., 235 U. S. 641, 644, 650\u2013651\n(1915). But, Fossil says, trademark is different. There\nalone, a willfulness requirement was so long and univer-\nsally recognized that today it rises to the level of a \u201cprinciple\nof equity\u201d the Lanham Act carries forward.\n   It\u2019s a curious suggestion. Fossil\u2019s contention that the\nterm \u201cprinciples of equity\u201d includes a willfulness require-\nment would not directly contradict the statute\u2019s other, ex-\npress mens rea provisions or render them wholly superflu-\nous. But it would require us to assume that Congress\nintended to incorporate a willfulness requirement here\nobliquely while it prescribed mens rea conditions expressly\nelsewhere throughout the Lanham Act. That might be pos-\nsible, but on first blush it isn\u2019t exactly an obvious construc-\ntion of the statute.\n   Nor do matters improve with a second look. The phrase\n\u201cprinciples of equity\u201d doesn\u2019t readily bring to mind a sub-\nstantive rule about mens rea from a discrete domain like\ntrademark law. In the context of this statute, it more nat-\nurally suggests fundamental rules that apply more system-\natically across claims and practice areas. A principle is a\n\u201cfundamental truth or doctrine, as of law; a comprehensive\nrule or doctrine which furnishes a basis or origin for others.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1417 (3d ed. 1933); Black\u2019s Law\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

And treatises and hand-\nbooks on the \u201cprinciples of equity\u201d generally contain\ntranssubstantive guidance on broad and fundamental ques-\ntions about matters like parties, modes of proof, defenses,\nand remedies. See, e.g., E. Merwin, Principles of Equity\nand Equity Pleading (1895); J. Indermaur & C. Thwaites,\nManual of the Principles of Equity (7th ed. 1913); H. Smith,\nPractical Exposition of the Principles of Equity (5th ed.\n1914); R. Megarry, Snell\u2019s Principles of Equity (23d ed.\n1947). Our precedent, too, has used the term \u201cprinciples of\nequity\u201d to refer to just such transsubstantive topics. See,\ne.g., eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391,\n393 (2006); Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 395\n(1946). Congress itself has elsewhere used \u201cequitable prin-\nciples\u201d in just this way: An amendment to a different sec-\ntion of the Lanham Act lists \u201claches, estoppel, and acquies-\ncence\u201d as examples of \u201cequitable principles.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71069. Given all this, it seems a little unlikely Congress\nmeant \u201cprinciples of equity\u201d to direct us to a narrow rule\nabout a profits remedy within trademark law.\n   But even if we were to spot Fossil that first essential\npremise of its argument, the next has problems too. From\nthe record the parties have put before us, it\u2019s far from clear\nwhether trademark law historically required a showing of\nwillfulness before allowing a profits remedy. The Trade-\nmark Act of 1905\u2014the Lanham Act\u2019s statutory predecessor\nwhich many earlier cases interpreted and applied\u2014did not\nmention such a requirement. It\u2019s true, as Fossil notes, that\nsome courts proceeding before the 1905 Act, and even some\nlater cases following that Act, did treat willfulness or some-\nthing like it as a prerequisite for a profits award and rarely\nauthorized profits for purely good-faith infringement. See,\ne.g., Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk Corp. v. Horluck\u2019s, Inc., 51 F. 2d\n357, 359 (WD Wash. 1931) (explaining that the plaintiff\n\u201ccannot recover defendant\u2019s profits unless it has been\nshown beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty\n\f6          ROMAG FASTENERS, INC. v. FOSSIL, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof willful fraud in the use of the enjoined trade-name\u201d); see\nalso Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 179 U. S. 42, 42\u201343\n(1900) (holding that one defendant \u201cshould not be required\nto account for gains and profits\u201d when it \u201cappear[ed] to have\nacted in good faith\u201d). But Romag cites other cases that ex-\npressly rejected any such rule.          See, e.g., Oakes v.\nTonsmierre, 49 F. 447, 453 (CC SD Ala. 1883); see\nalso Stonebraker v. Stonebraker, 33 Md. 252, 268 (1870);\nLawrence-Williams Co. v. Societe Enfants Gombault et Cie,\n52 F. 2d 774, 778 (CA6 1931).\n   The confusion doesn\u2019t end there. Other authorities ad-\nvanced still different understandings about the relation-\nship between mens rea and profits awards in trademark\ncases. See, e.g., H. Nims, Law of Unfair Competition and\nTrade-Marks \u00a7424 (2d ed. 1917) (\u201cAn accounting will not be\nordered where the infringing party acted innocently and in\nignorance of the plaintiff\u2019s rights\u201d); N. Hesseltine, Digest of\nthe Law of Trade-Marks and Unfair Trade 305 (1906) (con-\ntrasting a case holding \u201c[n]o account as to profits allowed\nexcept as to user after knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s right to trade-\nmark\u201d and one permitting profits \u201calthough defendant did\nnot know of infringement\u201d (emphasis added)). And the vast\nmajority of the cases both Romag and Fossil cite simply\nfailed to speak clearly to the issue one way or another. See,\ne.g., Hostetter v. Vowinkle, 12 F. Cas. 546, 547 (No. 6,714)\n(CC Neb. 1871); Graham v. Plate, 40 Cal. 593, 597\u2013599\n(1871); Hemmeter Cigar Co. v. Congress Cigar Co., 118\nF. 2d 64, 71\u201372 (CA6 1941).\n   At the end of it all, the most we can say with certainty is\nthis. Mens rea figured as an important consideration in\nawarding profits in pre-Lanham Act cases. This reflects the\nordinary, transsubstantive principle that a defendant\u2019s\nmental state is relevant to assigning an appropriate rem-\nedy. That principle arises not only in equity, but across\nmany legal contexts. See, e.g., Smith v. Wade, 461 U. S. 30,\n38\u201351 (1983) (42 U. S. C. \u00a71983); Morissette v. United\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, 342 U. S. 246, 250\u2013263 (1952) (criminal law);\nWooden-Ware Co. v. United States, 106 U. S. 432, 434\u2013435\n(1882) (common law trespass). It\u2019s a principle reflected in\nthe Lanham Act\u2019s text, too, which permits greater statutory\ndamages for certain willful violations than for other\nviolations. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71117(c). And it is a principle long\nreflected in equity practice where district courts have often\nconsidered a defendant\u2019s mental state, among other factors,\nwhen exercising their discretion in choosing a fitting\nremedy. See, e.g., L. P. Larson, Jr., Co. v. Wm. Wrigley, Jr.,\nCo., 277 U. S. 97, 99\u2013100 (1928); Lander v. Lujan, 888 F. 2d\n153, 155\u2013156 (CADC 1989); United States v. Klimek, 952\nF. Supp. 1100, 1117 (ED Pa. 1997). Given these traditional\nprinciples, we do not doubt that a trademark defendant\u2019s\nmental state is a highly important consideration in deter-\nmining whether an award of profits is appropriate. But ac-\nknowledging that much is a far cry from insisting on the\ninflexible precondition to recovery Fossil advances.\n   With little to work with in the statute\u2019s language, struc-\nture, and history, Fossil ultimately rests on an appeal to\npolicy.

The Lanham Act provision governing\n remedies for trademark violations, \u00a71117(a), makes a showing of will-\n fulness a precondition to a profits award in a suit under \u00a71125(c) for\n trademark dilution, but \u00a71125(a) has never required such a showing.\n Reading words into a statute should be avoided, especially when they\n are included elsewhere in the very same statute. That absence seems\n all the more telling here, where the Act speaks often, expressly, and\n with considerable care about mental states. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71117(b), (c),\n 1118.

A district court may\naward a winning plaintiff injunctive relief, damages, or the\ndefendant\u2019s ill-gotten profits. Without question, a defend-\nant\u2019s state of mind may have a bearing on what relief a\nplaintiff should receive. An innocent trademark violator\noften stands in very different shoes than an intentional one.\nBut some circuits have gone further. These courts hold a\nplaintiff can win a profits remedy, in particular, only after\nshowing the defendant willfully infringed its trademark.\nThe question before us is whether that categorical rule can\nbe reconciled with the statute\u2019s plain language.\n  The question comes to us in a case involving handbag\nfasteners. Romag sells magnetic snap fasteners for use in\nleather goods. Fossil designs, markets, and distributes a\nwide range of fashion accessories. Years ago, the pair\nsigned an agreement allowing Fossil to use Romag\u2019s fasten-\ners in Fossil\u2019s handbags and other products. Initially, both\nsides seemed content with the arrangement. But in time\nRomag discovered that the factories Fossil hired in China\n\f2           ROMAG FASTENERS, INC. v. FOSSIL, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto make its products were using counterfeit Romag fasten-\ners\u2014and that Fossil was doing little to guard against the\npractice. Unable to resolve its concerns amicably, Romag\nsued. The company alleged that Fossil had infringed its\ntrademark and falsely represented that its fasteners came\nfrom Romag. After trial, a jury agreed with Romag, and\nfound that Fossil had acted \u201cin callous disregard\u201d of Ro-\nmag\u2019s rights. At the same time, however, the jury rejected\nRomag\u2019s accusation that Fossil had acted willfully, as that\nterm was defined by the district court.\n  For our purposes, the last finding is the important one.\nBy way of relief for Fossil\u2019s trademark violation, Romag\nsought (among other things) an order requiring Fossil to\nhand over the profits it had earned thanks to its trademark\nviolation. But the district court refused this request. The\ncourt pointed out that controlling Second Circuit precedent\nrequires a plaintiff seeking a profits award to prove that the\ndefendant\u2019s violation was willful. Not all circuits, however,\nagree with the Second Circuit\u2019s rule. We took this case to\nresolve that dispute over the law\u2019s demands. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019).\n  Where does Fossil\u2019s proposed willfulness rule come from?\nThe relevant section of the Lanham Act governing remedies\nfor trademark violations, \u00a735, 60 Stat. 439\u2013440, as\namended, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71117(a), says this:\n         \u201cWhen a violation of any right of the registrant of a\n      mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, a\n      violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this title, or a\n      willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title, shall\n      have been established . . . , the plaintiff shall be enti-\n      tled, subject to the provisions of sections 1111 and 1114\n      of this title, and subject to the principles of equity, to\n      recover (1) defendant\u2019s profits, (2) any damages sus-\n      tained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action.\u201d\n    Immediately, this language spells trouble for Fossil and\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe circuit precedent on which it relies. The statute does\nmake a showing of willfulness a precondition to a profits\naward when the plaintiff proceeds under \u00a71125(c). That\nsection, added to the Lanham Act some years after its\ninitial adoption, creates a cause of action for trademark\ndilution\u2014conduct that lessens the association consumers\nhave with a trademark. But Romag alleged and proved a\nviolation of \u00a71125(a), a provision establishing a cause of ac-\ntion for the false or misleading use of trademarks. And in\ncases like that, the statutory language has never required a\nshowing of willfulness to win a defendant\u2019s profits. Yes, the\nlaw tells us that a profits award is subject to limitations\nfound in \u00a7\u00a71111 and 1114. But no one suggests those cross-\nreferenced sections contain the rule Fossil seeks. Nor does\nthis Court usually read into statutes words that aren\u2019t\nthere. It\u2019s a temptation we are doubly careful to avoid when\nCongress has (as here) included the term in question else-\nwhere in the very same statutory provision.\n   A wider look at the statute\u2019s structure gives us even more\nreason for pause. The Lanham Act speaks often and ex-\npressly about mental states. Section 1117(b) requires\ncourts to treble profits or damages and award attorney\u2019s\nfees when a defendant engages in certain acts intentionally\nand with specified knowledge. Section 1117(c) increases the\ncap on statutory damages from $200,000 to $2,000,000 for\ncertain willful violations. Section 1118 permits courts to\norder the infringing items be destroyed if a plaintiff proves\nany violation of \u00a71125(a) or a willful violation of \u00a71125(c).\nSection 1114 makes certain innocent infringers subject only\nto injunctions. Elsewhere, the statute specifies certain\nmens rea standards needed to establish liability, before\neven getting to the question of remedies. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a71125(d)(1)(A)(i), (B)(i) (prohibiting certain conduct only if\nundertaken with \u201cbad faith intent\u201d and listing nine factors\nrelevant to ascertaining bad faith intent). Without doubt,\nthe Lanham Act exhibits considerable care with mens rea\n\f4          ROMAG FASTENERS, INC. v. FOSSIL, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstandards. The absence of any such standard in the provi-\nsion before us, thus, seems all the more telling.\n   So how exactly does Fossil seek to conjure a willfulness\nrequirement out of \u00a71117(a)? Lacking any more obvious\nstatutory hook, the company points to the language indicat-\ning that a violation under \u00a71125(a) can trigger an award of\nthe defendant\u2019s profits \u201csubject to the principles of equity.\u201d\nIn Fossil\u2019s telling, equity courts historically required a\nshowing of willfulness before authorizing a profits remedy\nin trademark disputes. Admittedly, equity courts didn\u2019t\nrequire so much in patent infringement cases and other\narguably analogous suits. See, e.g., Dowagiac Mfg. Co. v.\nMinnesota Moline Plow Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98333\"><a href=\"/opinion/98333/dowagiac-mfg-co-v-minnesota-moline-plow-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644, 650\u2013651\n(1915). But, Fossil says, trademark is different. There\nalone, a willfulness requirement was so long and univer-\nsally recognized that today it rises to the level of a \u201cprinciple\nof equity\u201d the Lanham Act carries forward.\n   It\u2019s a curious suggestion. Fossil\u2019s contention that the\nterm \u201cprinciples of equity\u201d includes a willfulness require-\nment would not directly contradict the statute\u2019s other, ex-\npress mens rea provisions or render them wholly superflu-\nous. But it would require us to assume that Congress\nintended to incorporate a willfulness requirement here\nobliquely while it prescribed mens rea conditions expressly\nelsewhere throughout the Lanham Act. That might be pos-\nsible, but on first blush it isn\u2019t exactly an obvious construc-\ntion of the statute.\n   Nor do matters improve with a second look. The phrase\n\u201cprinciples of equity\u201d doesn\u2019t readily bring to mind a sub-\nstantive rule about mens rea from a discrete domain like\ntrademark law. In the context of this statute, it more nat-\nurally suggests fundamental rules that apply more system-\natically across claims and practice areas. A principle is a\n\u201cfundamental truth or doctrine, as of law; a comprehensive\nrule or doctrine which furnishes a basis or origin for others.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1417 (3d ed. 1933); Black\u2019s Law\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

And treatises and hand-\nbooks on the \u201cprinciples of equity\u201d generally contain\ntranssubstantive guidance on broad and fundamental ques-\ntions about matters like parties, modes of proof, defenses,\nand remedies. See, e.g., E. Merwin, Principles of Equity\nand Equity Pleading (1895); J. Indermaur & C. Thwaites,\nManual of the Principles of Equity (7th ed. 1913); H. Smith,\nPractical Exposition of the Principles of Equity (5th ed.\n1914); R. Megarry, Snell\u2019s Principles of Equity (23d ed.\n1947). Our precedent, too, has used the term \u201cprinciples of\nequity\u201d to refer to just such transsubstantive topics. See,\ne.g., eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145655\"><a href=\"/opinion/145655/ebay-inc-v-mercexchange-ll/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391,\n393 (2006); Holmberg v.

Congress itself has elsewhere used \u201cequitable prin-\nciples\u201d in just this way: An amendment to a different sec-\ntion of the Lanham Act lists \u201claches, estoppel, and acquies-\ncence\u201d as examples of \u201cequitable principles.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\u00a71069. Given all this, it seems a little unlikely Congress\nmeant \u201cprinciples of equity\u201d to direct us to a narrow rule\nabout a profits remedy within trademark law.\n   But even if we were to spot Fossil that first essential\npremise of its argument, the next has problems too. From\nthe record the parties have put before us, it\u2019s far from clear\nwhether trademark law historically required a showing of\nwillfulness before allowing a profits remedy. The Trade-\nmark Act of 1905\u2014the Lanham Act\u2019s statutory predecessor\nwhich many earlier cases interpreted and applied\u2014did not\nmention such a requirement. It\u2019s true, as Fossil notes, that\nsome courts proceeding before the 1905 Act, and even some\nlater cases following that Act, did treat willfulness or some-\nthing like it as a prerequisite for a profits award and rarely\nauthorized profits for purely good-faith infringement.

Given these traditional\nprinciples, we do not doubt that a trademark defendant\u2019s\nmental state is a highly important consideration in deter-\nmining whether an award of profits is appropriate. But ac-\nknowledging that much is a far cry from insisting on the\ninflexible precondition to recovery Fossil advances.\n   With little to work with in the statute\u2019s language, struc-\nture, and history, Fossil ultimately rests on an appeal to\npolicy.

Argued December 3, 2019\u2014Decided April 20, 2020\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Lia-\n  bility Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a79601 et seq., also known as the Superfund stat-\n  ute, promotes \u201cthe timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and [en-\n  sures] that the costs of such cleanup efforts [are] borne by those\n  responsible for the contamination,\u201d CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573\n  U. S. 1, 4 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Act directs the En-\n  vironmental Protection Agency to compile and annually revise a prior-\n  itized list of contaminated sites for cleanup, known as Superfund sites,\n  and makes responsible parties liable for the cost of the cleanup. Before\n  a cleanup plan is selected, a remedial investigation and feasibility\n  study is conducted to assess the contamination and evaluate cleanup\n  options. Once that study begins, \u00a7122(e)(6) of the Act provides, \u201cno\n  potentially responsible party may undertake any remedial action\u201d at\n  the site without EPA approval. To insulate cleanup plans from collat-\n  eral attack, \u00a7113(b) provides federal district courts with \u201cexclusive\n  original jurisdiction over all controversies arising under\u201d the Act, and\n  \u00a7113(h) then strips those courts of jurisdiction \u201cto review any chal-\n  lenges to removal or remedial action,\u201d except in five limited circum-\n  stances.\n     For nearly a century, the Anaconda Copper Smelter in Butte, Mon-\n  tana contaminated an area of over 300 square miles with arsenic and\n  lead. Over the past 35 years, EPA has worked with the current owner\n  of the now-closed smelter, Atlantic Richfield Company, to implement\n  a cleanup plan for a remediation expected to continue through 2025.\n  A group of 98 landowners sued Atlantic Richfield in Montana state\n  court for common law nuisance, trespass, and strict liability, seeking\n  restoration damages, which Montana law requires to be spent on prop-\n  erty rehabilitation. The landowners\u2019 proposed plan exceeds the\n\f2             ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n measures found necessary to protect human health and the environ-\n ment by EPA. The trial court granted summary judgment to the land-\n owners on the issue of whether the Act precluded their restoration\n damages claim and allowed the lawsuit to continue. After granting a\n writ of supervisory control, the Montana Supreme Court affirmed, re-\n jecting Atlantic Richfield\u2019s argument that \u00a7113 stripped the Montana\n courts of jurisdiction over the landowners\u2019 claim and concluding that\n the landowners were not potentially responsible parties (or PRPs) pro-\n hibited from taking remedial action without EPA approval under\n \u00a7122(e)(6).\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the Montana Supreme\n Court\u2019s decision. To qualify as a final judgment subject to review un-\n der 28 U. S. C. \u00a71257(a), a state court judgment must be \u201can effective\n determination of the litigation and not of merely interlocutory or in-\n termediate steps therein.\u201d Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U. S. 75,\n 81. Under Montana law, a supervisory writ proceeding is a self-con-\n tained case, not an interlocutory appeal. Mont. Const., Art. VII,\n \u00a7\u00a72(1)\u2013(2); Mont. Rules App. Proc. 6(6), 14(1), 14(3). Thus, the writ\n issued in this case is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U. S.\n 382, 385, n. 7. P. 8.\n    2. The Act does not strip the Montana courts of jurisdiction over this\n lawsuit. Section 113(b) of the Act provides that \u201cthe United States\n district courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all contro-\n versies arising under this chapter,\u201d so state courts lack jurisdiction\n over such actions. The use of \u201carising under\u201d in \u00a7113(b) echoes Con-\n gress\u2019s more familiar use of that phrase in granting federal courts ju-\n risdiction over \u201call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws,\n or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. In the mine run\n of cases, \u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.\u201d\n American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260.\n The landowners\u2019 common law nuisance, trespass, and strict liability\n claims arise under Montana law and not under the Act.\n    Atlantic Richfield mistakenly argues that \u00a7113(h)\u2014which states\n that \u201c[n]o Federal court shall have jurisdiction under Federal law . . .\n to review any challenges to removal or remedial action\u201d selected under\n the Act\u2014implicitly broadens the scope of actions precluded from state\n court jurisdiction under \u00a7113(b). But \u00a7113(h) speaks of \u201cFederal\n court[s],\u201d not state courts. There is no textual basis for Atlantic Rich-\n field\u2019s argument that Congress precluded state courts from hearing a\n category of cases in \u00a7113(b) by stripping federal courts of jurisdiction\n over those cases in \u00a7113(h). Often the simplest explanation is the best:\n Section 113(b) deprives state courts of jurisdiction over cases \u201carising\n\f                    Cite as: 590 U.

The Montana Supreme Court erred by holding that the landown-\ners were not potentially responsible parties under the Act and thus did\nnot need EPA approval to take remedial action. To determine who is\na potentially responsible party, the Court looks to the list of \u201ccovered\npersons\u201d in \u00a7107, the Act\u2019s liability section, which includes any \u201cowner\u201d\nof \u201ca facility.\u201d \u201cFacility\u201d in turn is defined to include \u201cany site or area\nwhere a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed of,\nor placed, or otherwise come to be located.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79601(9)(B).\nBecause arsenic and lead are hazardous substances that have \u201ccome\nto be located\u201d on the landowners\u2019 properties, the landowners are po-\ntentially responsible parties.\n   The landowners argue they are no longer potentially responsible\nparties because the Act\u2019s six-year limitations period for recovery of re-\nmedial costs has run, and thus they could not be held liable in a hypo-\nthetical lawsuit. But even \u201c \u2018innocent\u2019 . . . landowner[s] whose land has\nbeen contaminated by another,\u201d and who are thus shielded from liabil-\nity by \u00a7107(b)(3)\u2019s so-called \u201cinnocent landowner\u201d or \u201cthird party\u201d de-\nfense, \u201cmay fall within the broad definitions of PRPs in \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(1)\u2013\n(4).\u201d United States v. Atlantic Research Corp., 551 U. S. 128, 136. The\nsame principle holds true for parties facing no liability because of the\nAct\u2019s limitations period.\n   Interpreting \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d to include owners of\npolluted property reflects the Act\u2019s objective to develop a \u201cComprehen-\nsive Environmental Response\u201d to hazardous waste pollution. Section\n122(e)(6) is one of several tools in the Act that ensure the careful de-\nvelopment of a single EPA-led cleanup effort rather than tens of thou-\nsands of competing individual ones.\n   Yet under the landowners\u2019 interpretation, property owners would be\nfree to dig up arsenic-infected soil and build trenches to redirect lead-\ncontaminated groundwater without even notifying EPA, so long as\nthey have not been sued within six years of commencement of the\ncleanup. Congress did not provide such a fragile remedy for such a\nserious problem.\n   The landowners alternatively argue that they are not potentially re-\nsponsible parties because they did not receive the notice of settlement\nnegotiations required by \u00a7122(e)(1). EPA has a policy of not suing in-\nnocent homeowners for pollution they did not cause, so it did not in-\nclude the landowners in settlement negotiations. But EPA\u2019s nonen-\nforcement policy does not alter the landowners\u2019 status as potentially\nresponsible parties. Section 107(a) unambiguously defines potentially\n\f4              ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    responsible parties, and EPA does not have authority to alter that def-\n    inition.\n       The landowners also argue that \u00a7122(e)(6) cannot carry the weight\n    ascribed to it because it is located in the section on settlement negoti-\n    ations. Settlements, however, are the heart of the Superfund statute.\n    Section 122(a) of the Act commands EPA to proceed by settlement\n    \u201c[w]henever practicable and in the public interest . . . in order to expe-\n    dite effective remedial actions and minimize litigation.\u201d And EPA\u2019s\n    efforts to negotiate settlement agreements and issue orders for clean-\n    ups account for approximately 69% of all cleanup work currently un-\n    derway.

Over the past 35 years, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency has worked with the\ncurrent owner of the smelter, Atlantic Richfield Company,\nto implement a cleanup plan under the Comprehensive En-\nvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of\n1980. EPA projects that the cleanup will continue through\n2025.\n  A group of 98 landowners sued Atlantic Richfield in\nMontana state court for common law nuisance, trespass,\nand strict liability. Among other remedies, the landowners\nsought restoration damages, which under Montana law\nmust be spent on rehabilitation of the property.

To insulate cleanup plans from\ncollateral attack, \u00a7113(b) of the Act provides federal district\ncourts with \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction over all contro-\nversies arising under\u201d the Act, and \u00a7113(h) then strips such\ncourts of jurisdiction \u201cto review any challenges to removal\nor remedial action,\u201d except in five limited circumstances.\n\u00a7\u00a79613(b), (h).\n                               B\n  Between 1884 and 1902, the Anaconda Copper Mining\nCompany built three copper smelters 26 miles west of the\nmining town of Butte, Montana. The largest one, the\nWashoe Smelter, featured a 585-foot smoke stack, taller\nthan the Washington Monument. The structure still towers\nover the area today, as part of the Anaconda Smoke Stack\nState Park. Together, the three smelters refined tens of\nmillions of pounds of copper ore mined in Butte, the \u201cRich-\nest Hill on Earth,\u201d to feed burgeoning demand for telephone\nwires and power lines.

CHRISTIAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMontana Standard (Aug. 8, 2018). From 1912 to 1973, An-\naconda Company payrolls totaled over $2.5 billion, compen-\nsating around three-quarters of Montana\u2019s work force.\n   Bust followed boom. By the 1970s, the falling price of\ncopper, an ongoing energy crisis, and the nationalization of\nAnaconda\u2019s copper mines in Chile and Mexico squeezed An-\naconda. But what others saw as an ailing relic, Atlantic\nRichfield saw as a turnaround opportunity, purchasing the\nAnaconda Company for the discount price of $700 million.\nUnfortunately, Atlantic Richfield was unable to revive An-\naconda\u2019s fortunes. By 1980 Atlantic Richfield had closed\nthe facility for good, and by 1984 Fortune had dubbed the\npurchase one of the \u201cDecade\u2019s Worst Mergers.\u201d Fisher, The\nDecade\u2019s Worst Mergers, Fortune, Apr. 30, 1984, p. 262.\n   Atlantic Richfield\u2019s troubles were just beginning. After\nCongress passed the Superfund statute in 1980, Atlantic\nRichfield faced strict and retroactive liability for the many\ntons of arsenic and lead that Anaconda had spewed across\nthe area over the previous century. In 1983, EPA desig-\nnated an area of more than 300 square miles around the\nsmelters as one of the inaugural Superfund sites. 48 Fed.\nReg. 40667. In the 35 years since, EPA has managed an\nextensive cleanup at the site, working with Atlantic Rich-\nfield to remediate more than 800 residential and commer-\ncial properties; remove 10 million cubic yards of tailings,\nmine waste, and contaminated soil; cap in place 500 million\ncubic yards of waste over 5,000 acres; and reclaim 12,500\nacres of land. EPA, Superfund Priority \u201cAnaconda\u201d 9 (Apr.\n2018), https://semspub.epa.gov/work/08/100003986.pdf. To\ndate, Atlantic Richfield estimates that it has spent roughly\n$450 million implementing EPA\u2019s orders.\n   More work remains. As of 2015, EPA\u2019s plan anticipated\ncleanup of more than 1,000 additional residential yards, re-\nvegetation of 7,000 acres of uplands, removal of several\nwaste areas, and closure of contaminated stream banks and\nrailroad beds.

The land-\nowners sought restoration damages, among other forms of\nrelief.\n   Under Montana law, property damages are generally\nmeasured by the \u201cdifference between the value of the prop-\nerty before and after the injury, or the diminution in value.\u201d\nSunburst School Dist.

In that\ncircumstance, the plaintiff may seek restoration damages,\neven if they exceed the property\u2019s diminution in value.\nSee ibid.; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7929, and\nComment b (1977).\n   To collect restoration damages, a plaintiff must demon-\nstrate that he has \u201creasons personal\u201d for restoring the prop-\nerty and that his injury is temporary and abatable, mean-\ning \u201c[t]he ability to repair [the] injury must be more than a\ntheoretical possibility.\u201d Sunburst School Dist.

CHRISTIAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The landowners here propose a restoration plan that goes\nbeyond EPA\u2019s own cleanup plan, which the agency had\nfound \u201cprotective of human health and the environment.\u201d\nEPA, Community Soils Operable Unit, Record of Decision\n(1996), App. 62. See also 42 U. S. C. \u00a79621(d)(1). For ex-\nample, the landowners propose a maximum soil contamina-\ntion level of 15 parts per million of arsenic, rather than the\n250 parts per million level set by EPA. And the landowners\nseek to excavate offending soil within residential yards to a\ndepth of two feet rather than EPA\u2019s chosen depth of one.\nThe landowners also seek to capture and treat shallow\ngroundwater through an 8,000-foot long, 15-foot deep, and\n3-foot wide underground permeable barrier, a plan the\nagency rejected as costly and unnecessary to secure safe\ndrinking water.\n   The landowners estimate that their cleanup would cost\nAtlantic Richfield $50 to $58 million. Atlantic Richfield\nwould place that amount in a trust and the trustee would\nrelease funds only for restoration work.\n   In the trial court, Atlantic Richfield and the landowners\nfiled competing motions for summary judgment on whether\nthe Act precluded the landowners\u2019 claim for restoration\ndamages.2 The court granted judgment for the landowners\non that issue and allowed the lawsuit to continue. After\ngranting a writ of supervisory control, the Montana Su-\npreme Court affirmed. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Montana\nSecond Jud. Dist.

But the Montana Su-\npreme Court reasoned that the landowners\u2019 plan was not\nsuch a challenge because it would not \u201cstop, delay, or\nchange the work EPA is doing.\u201d Id., at 83, 408 P. 3d, at 520.\nThe landowners were \u201csimply asking to be allowed to pre-\nsent their own plan to restore their own private property to\na jury of twelve Montanans who will then assess the merits\nof that plan.\u201d Id., at 84, 408 P. 3d, at 521.\n   The Montana Supreme Court also rejected Atlantic Rich-\nfield\u2019s argument that the landowners were potentially re-\nsponsible parties (sometimes called PRPs) prohibited from\ntaking remedial action without EPA approval under\n\u00a7122(e)(6) of the Act. The Court observed that the landown-\ners had \u201cnever been treated as PRPs for any purpose\u2014by\neither EPA or [Atlantic Richfield]\u2014during the entire thirty-\nplus years\u201d since the designation of the Superfund site, and\nthat the statute of limitations for a claim against the land-\nowners had run.

CHRISTIAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt has jurisdiction to review the decision of the Montana\nSupreme Court and, if so, whether the Montana courts\nhave jurisdiction over the landowners\u2019 claim for restoration\ndamages.\n                                A\n   Congress has authorized this Court to review \u201c[f]inal\njudgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a\nState.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71257(a). To qualify as final, a state\ncourt judgment must be \u201can effective determination of the\nlitigation and not of merely interlocutory or intermediate\nsteps therein.\u201d Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U. S. 75, 81\n(1997). The landowners contend that, because the Montana\nSupreme Court allowed the case to proceed to trial, its judg-\nment was not final and we lack jurisdiction.\n   But the Montana Supreme Court exercised review in this\ncase through a writ of supervisory control. Under Montana\nlaw, a supervisory writ proceeding is a self-contained case,\nnot an interlocutory appeal. Mont. Const., Art. VII, \u00a7\u00a72(1)\u2013\n(2); Mont. Rules App. Proc. 6(6), 14(1), 14(3) (2019). Thus\nwe have held that a \u201cwrit of supervisory control issued by\nthe Montana Supreme Court is a final judgment within our\njurisdiction.\u201d Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial\nDist. of Mont., 424 U. S. 382, 385, n. 7 (1976) (per curiam).\n   The landowners protest that our precedents only support\nreviewing supervisory writ proceedings that are limited to\njurisdictional questions. But the scope of our jurisdiction to\nreview supervisory writ proceedings is not so restricted.\nWhen the Montana Supreme Court issues a writ of super-\nvisory control, it initiates a separate lawsuit. It is the na-\nture of the Montana proceeding, not the issues the state\ncourt reviewed, that establishes our jurisdiction.\n                             B\n  We likewise find that the Act does not strip the Montana\ncourts of jurisdiction over this lawsuit.

Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). But Atlantic Richfield seeks more than a remand. It\ncontends that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the Montana\ncourts lack jurisdiction, and the Federal Government agrees. The differ-\nence between outright dismissal and further proceedings matters. We\ngranted review of this issue and both parties have fully briefed and ar-\ngued it. Simply leaving the question unanswered at this point would\nleave the parties in a state of uncertainty as to whether the litigation is\nproceeding in the proper forum. We therefore find it both \u201cnecessary\u201d\nand \u201cprudent\u201d to decide the issue. Post, at 1.\n   4 There is a \u201cspecial and small category of cases\u201d that originate in state\n\nlaw yet still arise under federal law for purposes of federal question ju-\nrisdiction. Gunn v. Minton, 568 U. S. 251, 258 (2013) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). To qualify for this narrow exception, a state law claim\nmust \u201cnecessarily raise[ ]\u201d a federal issue, among other requirements.\nIbid. No element of the landowners\u2019 state common law claims neces-\nsarily raises a federal issue. Atlantic Richfield raises the Act as an af-\nfirmative defense, but \u201c[f]ederal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an\nactual or anticipated defense.\u201d Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556 U. S. 49, 60\n(2009).\n\f10            ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nAct. As a result, the Montana courts retain jurisdiction\nover this lawsuit, notwithstanding the channeling of Super-\nfund claims to federal courts in \u00a7113(b).5\n   Atlantic Richfield takes a different view, arguing that\n\u00a7113(h) implicitly broadens the scope of actions precluded\nfrom state court jurisdiction under \u00a7113(b). Section 113(h)\nstates that \u201c[n]o Federal court shall have jurisdiction under\nFederal law other than under section 1332 of title 28 (relat-\ning to diversity of citizenship jurisdiction) . . . to review any\nchallenges to removal or remedial action\u201d selected under\nthe Act. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(h).\n   The company\u2019s argument proceeds in five steps. Step\none: Section 113(h) removes federal court jurisdiction over\nall cleanup challenges, regardless of whether they originate\nin federal or state law (except for when the court is sitting\nin diversity). Step two: Section 113(h) can only remove ju-\nrisdiction that \u00a7113(b) provides in the first place. Step\nthree: Section 113(b) thus provides federal courts jurisdic-\ntion over all cleanup challenges, whether brought under\nfederal or state law. Step four: The grant of jurisdiction to\nfederal courts in \u00a7113(b) is exclusive to federal courts. Step\nfive: State courts thus do not have jurisdiction over cleanup\nchallenges.\n   This interpretation faces several insurmountable obsta-\ncles. First, by its own terms, \u00a7113(h) speaks of \u201cFederal\ncourt[s],\u201d not state courts. There is no textual basis for At-\nlantic Richfield\u2019s argument that Congress precluded state\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Section 113(b) specifies that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction\n\n\u201cwithout regard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in contro-\nversy.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(b). This is somewhat redundant because all\nactions that \u201carise under\u201d the Act necessarily satisfy federal question ju-\nrisdiction. But \u201c[s]ometimes the better overall reading of the statute con-\ntains some redundancy.\u201d Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586\nU. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11). We find it much more likely that\nCongress employed a belt and suspenders approach to make sure that\nall CERCLA lawsuits are routed to federal court than that Congress in-\ntended the reference to federal courts in \u00a7113(h) to affect state courts.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts from hearing a category of cases in \u00a7113(b) by strip-\nping federal courts of jurisdiction over those cases in\n\u00a7113(h). And if that were Congress\u2019s goal, it would be hard\nto imagine a more oblique way of achieving it. Often the\nsimplest explanation is the best: Section 113(b) deprives\nstate courts of jurisdiction over cases \u201carising under\u201d the\nAct\u2014just as it says\u2014while \u00a7113(h) deprives federal courts\nof jurisdiction over certain \u201cchallenges\u201d to Superfund reme-\ndial actions\u2014just as it says.\n   Second, the company\u2019s argument does not account for the\nexception in \u00a7113(h) for federal courts sitting in diversity.\nSection 113(h) permits federal courts in diversity cases to\nentertain state law claims regardless of whether they are\nchallenges to cleanup plans. See DePue v. Exxon Mobil\nCorp., 537 F. 3d 775, 784 (CA7 2008). But Atlantic Rich-\nfield does not even try to explain why the Act would permit\nsuch state law claims to proceed in federal court, but not in\nstate court. The Act permits federal courts and state courts\nalike to entertain state law claims, including challenges to\ncleanups.\n   That leads us to the third difficulty with Atlantic Rich-\nfield\u2019s argument. We have recognized a \u201cdeeply rooted pre-\nsumption in favor of concurrent state court jurisdiction\u201d\nover federal claims. Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458\u2013\n459 (1990). Only an \u201cexplicit statutory directive,\u201d an \u201cun-\nmistakable implication from legislative history,\u201d or \u201ca clear\nincompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal\ninterests\u201d can displace this presumption. Id., at 460. Ex-\nplicit, unmistakable, and clear are not words that describe\nAtlantic Richfield\u2019s knotty interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7113(b)\nand (h).\n   It would be one thing for Atlantic Richfield to try to sur-\nmount the clear statement rule that applies to the uncom-\nmon, but not unprecedented, step of stripping state courts\nof jurisdiction over federal claims. But Atlantic Richfield\u2019s\nposition requires a more ambitious step: Congress stripping\n\f12         ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstate courts of jurisdiction to hear their own state claims.\nWe would not expect Congress to take such an extraordi-\nnary step by implication. Yet the only provision Atlantic\nRichfield invokes addresses \u201c[f]ederal court[s]\u201d without\neven mentioning state courts, let alone stripping those\ncourts of jurisdiction to hear state law claims. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a79613(h).\n    Finally, the Government, supporting Atlantic Richfield,\nemphasizes that the opening clause of \u00a7113(b) excepts\n\u00a7113(h) from its application. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(b) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsections (a) and (h) of this section\n. . . .\u201d). According to the Government, because \u201cexceptions\nmust by definition be narrower than the corresponding\nrule,\u201d all challenges to remedial plans under \u00a7113(h)\u2014\nwhether based in federal or state law\u2014must \u201carise under\u201d\nthe Act for purposes of \u00a7113(b). Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 25.\n    We reject the premise and with it the conclusion. \u201cThou-\nsands of statutory provisions use the phrase \u2018except as pro-\nvided in . . . \u2019 followed by a cross-reference in order to indi-\ncate that one rule should prevail over another in any\ncircumstance in which the two conflict.\u201d Cyan, Inc. v. Bea-\nver County Employees Retirement Fund, 583 U. S. ___, ___\n(2018) (slip op., at 9). Such clauses explain what happens\nin the case of a clash, but they do not otherwise expand or\ncontract the scope of either provision by implication. Cf.\nNLRB v. SW General, Inc., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip\nop., at 11) (explaining the same principle for \u201cnotwithstand-\ning\u201d clauses).\n    The actions referred to in \u00a7113(h) do not fall entirely\nwithin \u00a7113(b). Challenges to remedial actions under fed-\neral statutes other than the Act, for example, are precluded\nby \u00a7113(h) but do not fall within \u00a7113(b). To cite another\nexample, \u00a7113(h) addresses state law challenges to cleanup\nplans in federal court, although those actions also do not\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfall within \u00a7113(b).6 At the same time, \u00a7113(b) is not sub-\nsumed by \u00a7113(h). Many claims brought under the Act,\nsuch as those to recover cleanup costs under \u00a7107, are not\nchallenges to cleanup plans.\n  Sections 113(b) and 113(h) thus each do work independ-\nent of one another. The two provisions overlap in a partic-\nular type of case: challenges to cleanup plans in federal\ncourt that arise under the Act. In such cases, the exceptions\nclause in \u00a7113(b) instructs that the limitation of \u00a7113(h)\nprevails. It does nothing more.\n                              III\n   Although the Montana Supreme Court answered the ju-\nrisdictional question correctly, the Court erred by holding\nthat the landowners were not potentially responsible par-\nties under the Act and therefore did not need EPA approval\nto take remedial action. Section 122(e)(6), titled \u201cIncon-\nsistent response action,\u201d provides that \u201c[w]hen either the\nPresident, or a potentially responsible party . . . has initi-\nated a remedial investigation and feasibility study for a\nparticular facility under this chapter, no potentially respon-\nsible party may undertake any remedial action at the facil-\nity unless such remedial action has been authorized by the\nPresident.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79622(e)(6). Both parties agree that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 JUSTICE ALITO argues that our interpretation leaves no meaning for\n\nthe exceptions in \u00a7113(h) for federal courts hearing state law actions\nwhile sitting in diversity and federal courts hearing actions invoking\nstate law standards deemed \u201capplicable or relevant and appropriate\u201d by\nthe Act. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(h). Because we read \u00a7113(b) to cover only\nfederal law claims, JUSTICE ALITO assumes that these exceptions in\n\u00a7113(h) would never apply. But as we explained, \u00a7113(h) applies to all\n\u201cchallenges to removal or remedial action\u201d that make their way into\n\u201c[f]ederal court,\u201d whether through \u00a7113(b) or some other route. \u00a79613(h).\nThat includes state law challenges arising by way of diversity jurisdic-\ntion or supplemental jurisdiction as well as federal law challenges aris-\ning under sources of law other than the Act. The exceptions in \u00a7113(h)\nare thus necessary to delineate which of these challenges may proceed in\nfederal court and which may not.\n\f14          ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthis provision would require the landowners to obtain EPA\napproval for their restoration plan if the landowners qualify\nas potentially responsible parties.\n   To determine who is a potentially responsible party, we\nlook to the list of \u201ccovered persons\u201d in \u00a7107, the liability sec-\ntion of the Act. \u00a79607(a). \u201cSection 107(a) lists four classes\nof potentially responsible persons (PRPs) and provides that\nthey \u2018shall be liable\u2019 for, among other things, \u2018all costs of\nremoval or remedial action incurred by the United States\nGovernment.\u2019 \u201d Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services,\nInc., 543 U. S. 157, 161 (2004) (quoting \u00a79607(a)(4)(A)). The\nfirst category under \u00a7107(a) includes any \u201cowner\u201d of \u201ca\nfacility.\u201d \u00a79607(a)(1). \u201cFacility\u201d is defined to include \u201cany\nsite or area where a hazardous substance has been depos-\nited, stored, disposed of, or placed, or otherwise come to be\nlocated.\u201d \u00a79601(9)(B). Arsenic and lead are hazardous sub-\nstances. 40 CFR \u00a7302.4, Table 302.4. Because those pollu-\ntants have \u201ccome to be located\u201d on the landowners\u2019 proper-\nties, the landowners are potentially responsible parties.\n   The landowners and JUSTICE GORSUCH argue that even\nif the landowners were once potentially responsible parties,\nthey are no longer because the Act\u2019s six-year limitations pe-\nriod for recovery of remedial costs has run, and thus they\ncould not be held liable in a hypothetical lawsuit. 42\nU. S. C. \u00a79613(g)(2)(B).\n   This argument collapses status as a potentially responsi-\nble party with liability for the payment of response costs. A\nproperty owner can be a potentially responsible party even\nif he is no longer subject to suit in court. As we have said,\n\u201c[E]ven parties not responsible for contamination may fall\nwithin the broad definitions of PRPs in \u00a7\u00a7107(a)(1)\u2013(4).\u201d\nUnited States v. Atlantic Research Corp., 551 U. S. 128, 136\n(2007). That includes \u201c \u2018innocent\u2019 . . . landowner[s] whose\nland has been contaminated by another,\u201d who would be\nshielded from liability by the Act\u2019s so-called \u201cinnocent land-\nowner\u201d or \u201cthird party\u201d defense in \u00a7107(b)(3). Ibid. See also\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n42 U. S. C. \u00a79607(b)(3). The same principle holds true for\nparties that face no liability because of the Act\u2019s limitations\nperiod.\n  Interpreting \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d to include\nowners of polluted property reflects the Act\u2019s objective to\ndevelop, as its name suggests, a \u201cComprehensive Environ-\nmental Response\u201d to hazardous waste pollution. Section\n122(e)(6) is one of several tools in the Act that ensure the\ncareful development of a single EPA-led cleanup effort ra-\nther than tens of thousands of competing individual ones.\n  Yet under the landowners\u2019 interpretation, property own-\ners would be free to dig up arsenic-infected soil and build\ntrenches to redirect lead-contaminated groundwater with-\nout even notifying EPA, so long as they have not been sued\nwithin six years of commencement of the cleanup.7 We\ndoubt Congress provided such a fragile remedy for such a\nserious problem. And we suspect most other landowners\nwould not be too pleased if Congress required EPA to sue\neach and every one of them just to ensure an orderly\ncleanup of toxic waste in their neighborhood. A straight-\nforward reading of the text avoids such anomalies.\n  JUSTICE GORSUCH argues that equating \u201cpotentially re-\nsponsible parties\u201d with \u201ccovered persons\u201d overlooks the fact\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 EPA does have other tools to address serious environmental harm.\n\nUnder \u00a7106, for example, EPA can initiate an injunctive abatement ac-\ntion if it finds an \u201cimminent and substantial endangerment to the public\nhealth or welfare or the environment.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79606(a). But EPA\nmay have good reasons to preserve the status quo of a cleanup site even\nabsent an imminent threat. More importantly, the landowners\u2019 interpre-\ntation would require EPA to monitor tens of thousands of properties\nacross 1,335 Superfund sites nationwide to ensure landowners do not\nderail an EPA cleanup. EPA, Superfund: National Priorities List (NPL)\n(Apr. 13, 2020), https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-\npriorities-list-npl. Congress provided a far more effective and efficient\nsolution in \u00a7122(e)(6): Landowners at Superfund sites containing hazard-\nous waste must seek EPA approval before initiating their own bespoke\ncleanups.\n\f16         ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the terms \u201cuse different language, appear in different\nstatutory sections, and address different matters.\u201d Post, at\n7 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). He\ncontends that \u201cpotentially responsible party\u201d as used in\n\u00a7122(e)(6) should be read as limited to the settlement con-\ntext, and that if Congress intended the phrase to have\nbroader reach\u2014to refer more generally to those potentially\nliable under \u00a7107(a)\u2014then Congress would have used the\nterm \u201ccovered person.\u201d Post, at 7\u20138.\n   But there is no reason to think Congress used these\nphrases to refer to two distinct groups of persons. Neither\nphrase appears among the Act\u2019s list of over 50 defined\nterms. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79601. \u201cCovered persons,\u201d in fact, ap-\npears in the caption to \u00a7107(a) and nowhere else. Mean-\nwhile, \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d are referenced not\njust in the section on settlements, but also in the Act\u2019s sec-\ntions regarding EPA response authority, cleanup standards\nand procedures, cleanup contractors, Superfund moneys,\nFederal Government cleanup sites, and civil proceedings.\n\u00a7\u00a79604, 9605, 9611, 9613, 9619, 9620, 9622. Across the\nstatute \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d refers to what it\nsays: parties that may be held accountable for hazardous\nwaste in particular circumstances. The only place in the\nAct that identifies such persons is the list of \u201cCovered per-\nsons\u201d in \u00a7107(a). Congress therefore must have intended\n\u201cpotentially responsible party\u201d in \u00a7122(e)(6) (as elsewhere\nin the Act) to refer to \u201cCovered persons\u201d in \u00a7107(a).\n   Turning from text to consequences, the landowners warn\nthat our interpretation of \u00a7122(e)(6) creates a permanent\neasement on their land, forever requiring them \u201cto get per-\nmission from EPA in Washington if they want to dig out\npart of their backyard to put in a sandbox for their grand-\nchildren.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 62. The grandchildren of Mon-\ntana can rest easy: The Act does nothing of the sort.\n   Section 122(e)(6) refers only to \u201cremedial action,\u201d a de-\nfined term in the Act encompassing technical actions like\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

S. C. \u00a79601(24).\nWhile broad, the Act\u2019s definition of remedial action does not\nreach so far as to cover planting a garden, installing a lawn\nsprinkler, or digging a sandbox. In addition, \u00a7122(e)(6)\napplies only to sites on the Superfund list. The Act re-\nquires EPA to annually review and reissue that list.\n\u00a79605(a)(8)(B). EPA delists Superfund sites once responsi-\nble parties have taken all appropriate remedial action and\nthe pollutant no longer poses a significant threat to public\nhealth or the environment. See 40 CFR \u00a7300.425(e).\n   The landowners and JUSTICE GORSUCH alternatively\nargue that the landowners are not potentially responsible\nparties because they did not receive the notice of settlement\nnegotiations required by \u00a7122(e)(1). Under a policy dating\nback to 1991, EPA does not seek to recover costs from resi-\ndential landowners who are not responsible for contamina-\ntion and do not interfere with the agency\u2019s remedy. EPA,\nPolicy Towards Owners of Residential Property at Super-\nfund Sites, OSWER Directive #9834.6 (July 3, 1991),\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/policy-\nowner-rpt.pdf. EPA views this policy as an exercise of its\n\u201cenforcement discretion in pursuing potentially responsible\nparties.\u201d Id., at 3. Because EPA has a policy of not suing\ninnocent homeowners for pollution they did not cause, it did\nnot include the landowners in settlement negotiations.\n   But EPA\u2019s nonenforcement policy does not alter the land-\nowners\u2019 status as potentially responsible parties. Section\n107(a) unambiguously defines potentially responsible par-\nties and EPA does not have authority to alter that defini-\ntion. See, e.g., Sturgeon v. Frost, 587 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3\n(2019) (slip op., at 16, n. 3). Section 122(e)(1) requires\nnotification of settlement negotiations to all potentially re-\nsponsible parties. To say that provision determines who is\n\f18         ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na potentially responsible party in the first instance would\nrender the Act circular. Even the Government does not\nclaim that its decisions whether to send notices of settle-\nment negotiations carry such authority.\n   In short, even if EPA ran afoul of \u00a7122(e)(1) by not provid-\ning the landowners notice of settlement negotiations, that\ndoes not change the landowners\u2019 status as potentially\nresponsible parties.\n   The landowners relatedly argue that the limitation in\n\u00a7122(e)(6) on remedial action by potentially responsible\nparties cannot carry the weight we assign to it because it is\nlocated in the Act\u2019s section on settlement negotiations. Con-\ngress, we are reminded, does not \u201chide elephants in mouse-\nholes.\u201d Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531\nU. S. 457, 468 (2001).\n   We take no issue with characterizing \u00a7122(e)(6) as an el-\nephant. It is, after all, one of the Act\u2019s crucial tools for en-\nsuring an orderly cleanup of toxic waste. But \u00a7122 of the\nAct is, at the risk of the tired metaphor spinning out of con-\ntrol, less a mousehole and more a watering hole\u2014exactly\nthe sort of place we would expect to find this elephant.\n   Settlements are the heart of the Superfund statute.\nEPA\u2019s efforts to negotiate settlement agreements and issue\norders for cleanups account for approximately 69% of all\ncleanup work currently underway.

It establishes a reticulated scheme of notices, pro-\nposals, and counterproposals for the settlement negotiation\nprocess. \u00a79622(e). And the subsection places a moratorium\non EPA remedial actions while negotiations are under way.\n\u00a79622(e)(2)(A). It is far from surprising to find an analo-\ngous provision restricting potentially responsible parties\nfrom taking remedial actions in the same subsection.\n   JUSTICE GORSUCH also contends that our interpretation\nviolates the Act\u2019s \u201csaving clauses,\u201d which provide that the\nAct does not preempt liability or requirements under state\nlaw.

CHRISTIAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAtlantic Richfield is also liable for the landowners\u2019 own re-\nmediation beyond that required under the Act. Even then,\nthe answer is yes\u2014so long as the landowners first obtain\nEPA approval for the remedial work they seek to carry out.\n   We likewise resist JUSTICE GORSUCH\u2019s evocative claim\nthat our reading of the Act endorses \u201cpaternalistic central\nplanning\u201d and turns a cold shoulder to \u201cstate law efforts to\nrestore state lands.\u201d Post, at 10. Such a charge fails to ap-\npreciate that cleanup plans generally must comply with \u201cle-\ngally applicable or relevant and appropriate\u201d standards of\nstate environmental law. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79621(d)(2)(A)(ii). Or\nthat States must be afforded opportunities for \u201csubstantial\nand meaningful involvement\u201d in initiating, developing, and\nselecting cleanup plans. \u00a79621(f )(1). Or that EPA usually\nmust defer initiating a cleanup at a contaminated site that\na State is already remediating. \u00a79605(h). It is not \u201cpater-\nnalistic central planning\u201d but instead the \u201cspirit of cooper-\native federalism [that] run[s] throughout CERCLA and its\nregulations.\u201d New Mexico v. General Elec. Corp., 467 F. 3d\n1223, 1244 (CA10 2006).\n   As a last ditch effort, the landowners contend that, even\nif \u00a7107(a) defines potentially responsible parties, they qual-\nify as contiguous property owners under \u00a7107(q), which\nwould pull them outside the scope of \u00a7107(a). The landown-\ners are correct that contiguous property owners are not po-\ntentially responsible parties. Section 107(q)(1)(A) provides\nthat \u201c[a] person that owns real property that is contiguous\nto or otherwise similarly situated with respect to, and that\nis or may be contaminated by a release or threatened re-\nlease of a hazardous substance from, real property that is\nnot owned by that person shall not be considered\u201d an owner\nof a facility under \u00a7107(a). \u00a79607(q)(1)(A). The problem for\nthe landowners is that there are eight further requirements\nto qualify as a contiguous property owner. \u00a7\u00a79607(q)(1)(A)(i)\u2013\n(viii). Each landowner individually must \u201cestablish by a\n\f                 Cite as: 590 U.

One of the\neight requirements is that, at the time the person acquired\nthe property, the person \u201cdid not know or have reason to\nknow that the property was or could be contaminated by a\nrelease or threatened release of one or more hazardous sub-\nstances.\u201d \u00a79607(q)(1)(A)(viii)(II). All of the landowners\nhere purchased their property after the Anaconda Company\nbuilt the Washington Monument sized smelter. Indeed \u201cev-\nidence of public knowledge\u201d of contamination was \u201calmost\noverwhelming.\u201d Christian v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 380\nMont. 495, 529, 358 P. 3d 131, 155 (2015). In the early\n1900s, the Anaconda Company actually obtained smoke\nand tailing easements authorizing the disposition of\nsmelter waste onto many properties now owned by the land-\nowners. Id., at 500\u2013501, 358 P. 3d, at 137\u2013138. The land-\nowners had reason to know their property \u201ccould be contam-\ninated by a release or threatened release\u201d of a hazardous\nsubstance. 42 U. S. C. \u00a79607(q)(1)(A)(viii)(II).\n   At any rate, contiguous landowners must provide \u201cfull\ncooperation, assistance, and access\u201d to EPA and those car-\nrying out Superfund cleanups in order to maintain that sta-\ntus. \u00a79607(q)(1)(A)(iv). But the Government has represented\nthat the landowners\u2019 restoration plan, if implemented,\nwould interfere with its cleanup by, for example, digging up\ncontaminated soil that has been deliberately capped in\nplace. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20\u201321.\nIf that is true, the landowners\u2019 plan would soon trigger a\nlack of cooperation between EPA and the landowners. At\nthat point, the landowners would no longer qualify as con-\ntiguous landowners and we would be back to square one.\n                      *    *     *\n  The Montana Supreme Court erred in holding that the\nlandowners were not potentially responsible parties under\n\f22         ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v.

That approval process, if pursued, could\nameliorate any conflict between the landowners\u2019 restora-\ntion plan and EPA\u2019s Superfund cleanup, just as Congress\nenvisioned. In the absence of EPA approval of the current\nrestoration plan, we have no occasion to entertain Atlantic\nRichfield\u2019s claim that the Act otherwise preempts the plan.\n   The judgment of the Montana Supreme Court is affirmed\nin part and vacated in part.

I thus agree with the Court that we possess jurisdic-\ntion to decide this case. See ante, at 8. I also agree that the\nlandowners are potentially responsible parties under\n\u00a7122(e)(6) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and, as\na result, cannot bring their Montana restoration damages\nclaim without the consent of the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA). See ante, at 13\u201321. At this point, however,\nI am not willing to endorse the Court\u2019s holding in Part II\u2013B\nthat state courts have jurisdiction to entertain \u201cchallenges\u201d\nto EPA-approved CERCLA plans.\n                               I\n   I would not decide that question because it is neither nec-\nessary nor prudent for us to do so. As I understand the\nCourt\u2019s opinion, the Montana Supreme Court has two op-\ntions on remand: (1) enter a stay to allow the landowners to\nseek EPA approval or (2) enter judgment against the land-\nowners on their restoration damages claim without preju-\ndice to their ability to refile if they obtain EPA approval.\nEither way, the case cannot proceed without the EPA\u2019s\n\f2            ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nblessing. And because the EPA has submitted multiple fil-\nings indicating that it believes that the landowners\u2019 plan\npresents serious environmental risks, it is likely that the\nEPA will not approve that plan, and the case will then die.\nIf that happens, the question of the state courts\u2019 jurisdiction\nwill be academic.\n   Alternatively, if the EPA approves the landowners\u2019 plan,\neither in full or to a degree that they find satisfactory, they\nmay not wish to press this litigation. And if they do choose\nto go forward, the question of state-court jurisdiction can be\ndecided at that time.\n   For these reasons, there is no need to reach out and de-\ncide the question now,1 and there are good reasons not to do\nso. While the question of state-court jurisdiction may turn\nout not to matter in this case, that question may have im-\nportant implications in other cases. Specifically, if the fears\nexpressed by the Government materialize, state courts and\njuries, eager to serve local interests, may disregard the\nEPA\u2019s expert judgment regarding the best plan for a\nCERCLA site and may mandate relief that exacerbates en-\nvironmental problems. See Brief for United States as Ami-\ncus Curiae 20\u201322, 29\u201330; App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a\u201374a.\nThus, much is potentially at stake, and the question\nwhether CERCLA allows state courts to entertain suits like\nthe one in this case depends on the interpretation of devil-\nishly difficult statutory provisions, CERCLA \u00a7\u00a7113(b) and\n(h), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a79613(b) and (h).\n   With much at stake, we should be confident that our an-\nswer is correct, and we have no basis for such confidence\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 We may not decide the merits of a case without assuring ourselves\n\nthat we have jurisdiction, Steel Co. v.

The question of state-court jurisdiction is only one of\nmany in this case, and the briefing and argument on that\nissue left important questions without fully satisfactory an-\nswers. The Court tries to clear up what \u00a7113 means, but as\nI will attempt to show, the Court\u2019s interpretation presents\nserious problems. Under these circumstances, the better\ncourse is not to decide this perplexing question at this\njuncture.\n                               II\n                               A\n  CERCLA \u00a7113 is like a puzzle with pieces that are ex-\nceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to fit together. Here is\nwhat these provisions say, with language that is not perti-\nnent for present purposes omitted:\n\n    \u201c(b) Jurisdiction; venue\n       \u201cExcept as provided in subsectio [n] . . .

C. \u00a79613.\n    For present purposes, the pertinent parts are as follows:\n\n \uf0b7 First, \u00a7113(b) sets out a general rule conferring on the\n     federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over claims\n     \u201carising under\u201d CERCLA. And it does so \u201cwithout re-\n     gard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in\n     controversy.\u201d\n \uf0b7 Second, \u00a7\u00a7113(b) and (h), taken together, reduce this\n     grant of jurisdiction by taking away jurisdiction over\n     most claims that \u201cchalleng [e]\u201d a \u201cremoval or remedial\n     action.\u201d\n \uf0b7 Third, this reduction does not apply to a challenge to\n     removal or remedial action if it is brought under the\n     diversity jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332.\n \uf0b7 Fourth, this reduction also does not apply to a chal-\n     lenge to removal or remedial action if it is brought in\n     federal court \u201cunder State law which is applicable or\n     relevant and appropriate under [\u00a7121] (relating to\n     cleanup standards).\u201d Under \u00a7121, cleanup standards\n     must comply with certain state-law requirements, and\n     thus the thrust of this last provision seems to be that a\n     removal or remedial action may be challenged in fed-\n     eral court for noncompliance with such requirements.\nWith these pieces laid out, we may consider how the Court\nand respondents, on the one hand, and the Government and\npetitioner, on the other, try to fit them together.\n                              B\n   The logical first step in any effort to understand how\n\u00a7\u00a7113(b) and (h) apply to the landowners\u2019 state-law restora-\ntion damages claim is to determine whether the claim falls\nwithin the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction that \u00a7113(b)\nconfers on the federal district courts\u2014in other words,\nwhether such a claim is one that \u201caris[es] under\u201d CERCLA.\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)             5\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nIf it does not, then that ends the inquiry. And that is what\nthe Court holds. Ante, at 8\u20139.\n   The Court interprets the phrase \u201carising under\u201d in\n\u00a7113(b) to mean the same thing as that phrase means in the\nfederal-question jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331.\nUnder that provision, as the Court puts it, \u201c[i]n the mine\nrun of cases, \u2018[a] suit arises under the law that creates the\ncause of action.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9 (quoting American Well Works\nCo. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916)). Thus,\nthe Court concludes, a claim arises under CERCLA only if\nit is based on CERCLA, and since the landowners\u2019 restora-\ntion damages claim is based on Montana law, it is obviously\nnot based on CERCLA and does not fall within the exclusive\njurisdiction conferred on the district courts by \u00a7113(b). This\nmakes short work of the question of state-court jurisdiction,\nbut it presents serious problems.\n   First, it cannot explain why \u00a7113(b) says that the juris-\ndiction it confers is \u201cwithout regard to the citizenship of the\nparties or the amount in controversy.\u201d If that jurisdiction\nis limited to claims that are based on CERCLA, district\ncourts have jurisdiction to entertain all those claims under\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71331, which does not require either diversity or\nany minimum amount in controversy. So why go out of the\nway to say that \u00a7113(b) jurisdiction does not require diver-\nsity or any minimum amount in controversy? The only log-\nical reason is to ensure that the provision covers suits that\ncould not be brought under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. Thus, \u00a7113(b)\njurisdiction must be broader than general federal-question\njurisdiction. By denying this, the Court\u2019s interpretation\nturns the phrase \u201cwithout regard to the citizenship of the\nparties or the amount in controversy\u201d into a meaningless\nand useless appendage.\n   Second, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, there is no rea-\nson why \u00a7113(h) should specify that its reduction of the\nscope of the jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7113(b) does not affect\n\f6            ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\na district court\u2019s jurisdiction in diversity cases. If the juris-\ndiction granted by \u00a7113(b) is limited to claims based on\nCERCLA, why would anyone think that it had any impact\non state-law claims?2\n  Third, if the jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7113(b) is limited to\nclaims based on CERCLA, it is unclear how a district court\ncould entertain a claim \u201cunder State law which is applicable\nor relevant and appropriate under [\u00a7121] (relating to\ncleanup standards).\u201d Yet \u00a7113(h) exempts such a claim\nfrom its general withdrawal of jurisdiction over challenges\nto removal or remedial action. It seems clear that Congress\ndid not regard these claims as claims under CERCLA itself,\nsince it describes them as \u201cunder State law\u201d and did not in-\nclude them on the list of claims under CERCLA that it like-\nwise exempted from \u00a7113(h)\u2019s general withdrawal of juris-\ndiction over challenges to removal or remedial action.\n\u00a7\u00a7113(h)(1)\u2013(5). These three problems raise serious doubt\nabout the correctness of the Court\u2019s interpretation.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court answers that \u00a7\u00a7113(b) and (h), though partially overlap-\n\nping, are \u201cindependent\u201d of each other. Ante, at 13, and n. 6. But this\nconclusion rests on an uneasy premise: that \u00a7113(b) pertains only to\ncauses of action based on CERCLA. There is reason to doubt that this is\nthe best reading of the statute. See supra, at 4\u20135 and this page.\n  3 The Court chalks up \u00a7113(b)\u2019s references to amount in controversy\n\nand party citizenship to a \u201cbelt and suspenders\u201d approach. Ante, at 10,\nn. 5. As the Court sees it, Congress must have wanted to make especially\nclear that \u201call CERCLA lawsuits,\u201d no matter the amount in dispute or\nthe citizenship of the parties, would be welcome in (and limited to) those\ncourts. Ibid.\n  It is true that \u201cinstances of surplusage are not unknown\u201d in federal\nstatutes. Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S.\n291, 299, n. 1 (2006). But it is also the case that the Court usually seeks\nto \u201cavoid a reading which renders some words altogether redundant.\u201d\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 574 (1995). In interpreting \u00a7113,\none way to avoid redundancy is to acknowledge the interlocking relation-\nship between \u00a7\u00a7113(b) and (h). Section 113(b) refers to the hallmarks of\ndiversity jurisdiction (amount in controversy and diversity), and \u00a7113(h)\nmakes clear that its clawback of jurisdiction over some \u201cchallenges\u201d to\nEPA plans does not affect state-law claims that satisfy 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332.\n\f                     Cite as: 590 U.

The Court, as noted, runs into trouble by interpret-\ning the phrase \u201carising under\u201d CERCLA in \u00a7113(b) to mean\nwhat \u201carising under\u201d means in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. The Gov-\nernment obviates this difficulty by arguing that \u201carising un-\nder\u201d in \u00a7113(b) has a broader meaning, such as the meaning\nof the same phrase in Article III of the Constitution. See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23\u201324. The Gov-\nernment suggests that \u201carising under\u201d in \u00a7113(b) may reach\n\u201c \u2018any case or controversy that might call for the application\nof federal law.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 24 (quoting Verlinden B. V. v. Cen-\ntral Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 492 (1983)). If \u00a7113(b)\nuses the phrase in something like this sense, the jurisdic-\ntion it confers can reach some claims under state law, and\nthat would explain \u00a7113(b)\u2019s specification that this jurisdic-\ntion is not dependent on either diversity or amount in con-\ntroversy. In other words, this language makes clear that\nfederal district courts have jurisdiction to hear these state-\nlaw claims without the restrictions that usually apply when\nfederal courts entertain such claims.\n    Up to this point, the interpretation favored by the Gov-\nernment and petitioner proceeds smoothly, but it stumbles\nwhen it moves from \u00a7113(b) to \u00a7113(h). That provision re-\nduces the grant of jurisdiction in \u00a7113(b) by taking away\njurisdiction over challenges to removal and remedial action\nunless, among other things, those claims are brought in a\ndiversity action. The upshot is that federal district courts\nare left with jurisdiction over most state-law claims that\nchallenge removal and remedial action only where the par-\nties are diverse.4 If it turns out that diversity is lacking,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 They also retain jurisdiction over claims \u201cunder State law which is\n\napplicable or relevant and appropriate under [\u00a7121] (relating to cleanup\n\f8            ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v.

Because \u00a7113(b)\u2019s grant of jurisdiction to the\nfederal district courts is exclusive, the state courts cannot\nentertain those claims either.\n  It is hard to fathom why Congress might have wanted\nsuch a scheme. Congress might have wanted all the state-\nlaw claims covered by \u00a7113(b) to be heard exclusively in fed-\neral court in order to prevent state courts and juries from\nunduly favoring home-state interests. But having granted\nthe federal district courts jurisdiction to hear these claims\nin \u00a7113(b), why would Congress take away that jurisdiction\nin cases where the parties happen not to be diverse? And\nwhy would Congress go further and prevent the state courts\nfrom hearing these claims? The Government and petitioner\nprovide no answer, and none is apparent.\n                              III\n  The Court gives three reasons for resolving the question\nof state-court jurisdiction. See ante, at 9, n. 3. None is\ncompelling.\n  First, the Court explains that \u201cAtlantic Richfield seeks\nmore than a remand,\u201d namely, it seeks a remand with in-\nstructions to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds. Ibid. But\nAtlantic Richfield presented its \u00a7122(e)(6) theory as an al-\nternate ground for reversal, and has prevailed on that ba-\nsis. As Atlantic Richfield\u2019s counsel stated at argument, the\n\u00a7122(e)(6) ruling is \u201csufficient to resolve the case.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 17\u201318.\n  Second, the Court says, \u201cleaving the [\u00a7113] question un-\nanswered . . . would leave the parties in a state of uncer-\ntainty.\u201d Ante, at 9, n. 3. But, as described above, there ap-\npears to be a slim chance that this case will, at least in its\ncurrent state, \u201cprocee[d]\u201d in the Montana courts.

App.\n311. Eventually, though, it became apparent the smelter\nwas producing more than just copper and jobs. Studies\nshowed that the plant emitted up to 62 tons of arsenic and\n10 tons of lead each day. Brief for Respondents 7. Thanks\nto what was once the world\u2019s tallest brick smokestack, these\nheavy metals blanketed the town and the whole of the Deer\nLodge Valley\u2014contaminating hundreds of square miles.\nToday, the smokestack is all that is left of the once massive\noperation. It stands alone in a state park, much of which\nremains dangerously contaminated and closed to the pub-\nlic. Visitors may view the stack, but only from a distance,\nthrough fences and between huge slag piles. Id., at 9.\n   This case involves nearly 100 nearby residents. Some\nhave lived in their homes for decades, some long before the\nenvironmental consequences of the smelter were fully ap-\npreciated. They say they have thought about moving, but\nfor many their property values aren\u2019t what they once were.\nBesides, as one homeowner put it, \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a kitchen\ndoor that\u2019s got all my kids\u2019 heights on it.\u201d Id., at 8.\n\f2          ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\n   The federal government has tried to help in its own way.\nIn 1983, the government designated the 300-square-mile\narea surrounding the smelter a Superfund site under the\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,\nand Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 94 Stat. 2767, as\namended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a79601 et seq. After years of study and\nnegotiation, the government ordered Atlantic Richfield to\nremove up to 18 inches of soil in residential yards with ar-\nsenic levels exceeding 250 parts per million (ppm). App.\n94\u201395. For so-called \u201cpasture land\u201d\u2014that is, nearly every-\nthing else\u2014the government set the threshold for soil re-\nmoval at 1,000 ppm. Brief for Respondents 8. By way of\nreference, even 100 ppm is sometimes considered too toxic\nfor local landfills, and the federal government itself has\nelsewhere set a threshold of 25 ppm. Ibid. Some States set\nresidential cleanup levels as low as 0.04 ppm. Ibid.\n   The cleanup work that followed left much to be desired.\nBy 2016, Atlantic Richfield claimed that it had virtually fin-\nished work on the landowners\u2019 properties. Yet, only 24 of\ntheir 77 properties had been remediated, and only about 5\npercent of the total acreage had been touched. Id., at 9. Soil\nnear Tammy Peters\u2019s daycare playground, for example, still\nshows an arsenic level of 292 ppm. But because the\n\u201cweighted average\u201d for her yard is below 250 ppm, Atlantic\nRichfield performed no cleanup of the playground at all.\nId., at 10.\n   So the landowners here proceeded as landowners histori-\ncally have: They sought remedies for the pollution on their\nlands in state court under state law. Their choice can come\nas no surprise. The federal government enjoys no general\npower to regulate private lands; it may intervene only con-\nsistent with the Commerce Clause or some other constitu-\ntionally enumerated power. Nor does the federal govern-\nment always intervene as fully as it might even when it can.\nMeanwhile, the regulation of real property and the protec-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)            3\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\ntion of natural resources is a traditional and central respon-\nsibility of state governments. And States have long allowed\nlandowners to seek redress for the pollution of their lands\nthrough ancient common law causes of action like nuisance\nand trespass. The landowners employed exactly these the-\nories when they brought suit in state court seeking restora-\ntion damages from Atlantic Richfield\u2014money that could be\nused only to remove arsenic, lead, and other toxins from\ntheir properties. The Montana Supreme Court has held\nthat the landowners\u2019 case states a viable claim for relief and\nwarrants trial.\n   Now, however, Atlantic Richfield wants us to call a halt\nto the proceedings. The company insists that CERCLA\npreempts and prohibits common law tort suits like this one.\nOn Atlantic Richfield\u2019s telling, CERCLA even prevents pri-\nvate landowners from voluntarily remediating their own\nproperties at their own expense. No one may do anything\nin 300 square miles of Montana, the company insists, with-\nout first securing the federal government\u2019s permission.\n   But what in the law commands that result? Everything\nin CERCLA suggests that it seeks to supplement, not sup-\nplant, traditional state law remedies and promote, not pro-\nhibit, efforts to restore contaminated land. Congress hardly\ncould have been clearer. It stated that, \u201c[n]othing in this\n[Act] shall be construed or interpreted as preempting any\nState from imposing any additional liability or require-\nments with respect to the release of hazardous substances\nwithin such State.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79614(a). It added that\n\u201c[n]othing in this [Act] shall affect or modify in any way the\nobligations or liabilities of any person under other Federal\nor State law, including common law, with respect to re-\nleases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or con-\ntaminants.\u201d \u00a79652(d). And it said again that \u201c[t]his [Act]\ndoes not affect or otherwise impair the rights of any person\nunder Federal, State, or common law, except with respect\nto the timing of review as provided\u201d elsewhere in provisions\n\f4           ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                      Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\nthat even the Court today does not invoke as limits on re-\ncovery here. \u00a79659(h). Three times Congress made its\npoint as plainly as anyone might.\n   So how does Atlantic Richfield seek to transform\nCERCLA from a tool to aid cleanups into a ban on them?\nThe company has to point to something in the statutory text\nthat trumps these many provisions and preempts the land-\nowners\u2019 right to use state law to restore their lands. After\nall, merely \u201c[i]nvoking some brooding federal interest or ap-\npealing to a judicial policy preference should never be\nenough to win preemption of a state law\u201d; instead, a party\nlike Atlantic Richfield seeking to displace state law must\nidentify \u201c \u2018a constitutional text or a federal statute\u2019 that does\nthe displacing.\u201d Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587\nU. S. ___, ___ (2019) (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 3)\n(quoting Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. ISLA Pe-\ntroleum Corp., 485 U. S. 495, 503 (1988)).\n   In answer, Atlantic Richfield directs our attention to\n\u00a7122(e)(6). It\u2019s a provision buried in a section captioned\n\u201cSettlements.\u201d The section outlines the process private par-\nties must follow to negotiate a settlement and release of\nCERCLA liability with the federal government. Subsection\n(e)(6) bears the title \u201cInconsistent response action\u201d and\nstates that, \u201c[w]hen either the President, or a potentially\nresponsible party pursuant to an administrative order or\nconsent decree under this chapter, has initiated a remedial\ninvestigation and feasibility study for a particular facility\nunder this chapter, no potentially responsible party may\nundertake any remedial action at the facility unless such\nremedial action has been authorized by the President.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a79622(e)(6). So even read for all its worth, this pro-\nvision only bars those \u201cpotentially responsible\u201d to the fed-\neral government from initiating cleanup efforts without\nprior approval. To get where it needs to go, Atlantic Rich-\nfield must find some way to label the innocent landowners\nhere \u201cpotentially responsible part[ies]\u201d on the hook for\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

When interpreting a statute, this\nCourt applies the law\u2019s ordinary public meaning at the time\nof the statute\u2019s adoption, here 1980. See Wisconsin Central\nLtd. v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at\n9). To be \u201cpotentially responsible\u201d for something meant\nthen, as it does today, that a person could possibly be held\naccountable for it; the outcome is capable of happening.\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1025 (1981); Webster\u2019s New\nCollegiate Dictionary 893 (1980). And there is simply no\nway the landowners here are potentially, possibly, or capa-\nble of being held liable by the federal government for any-\nthing. In the first place, the federal government never no-\ntified the landowners that they might be responsible\nparties, as it must under \u00a7122(e)(1). Additionally, everyone\nadmits that the period allowed for bringing a CERLCA\nclaim against them has long since passed under\n\u00a7113(g)(2)(B). On any reasonable account, the landowners\nare potentially responsible to the government for exactly\nnothing.\n   Statutory context is of a piece with the narrow text.\nNothing in \u00a7122 affects the rights of strangers to the federal\ngovernment\u2019s settlement process. Everything in the section\nspeaks to the details of that process. The section requires\nthe government to provide all potentially responsible par-\nties with notice that they might be held responsible for re-\nmedial measures. \u00a79622(e)(1). It instructs the government\nto give a potentially responsible party a list of everyone else\nso designated. Ibid. It specifies procedures for sharing\nproposals and counterproposals among this group.\n\u00a7\u00a79622(e)(2)\u2013(3). It allows the government to release from\nfederal liability those who agree to settle and clean up haz-\nardous sites. See \u00a7\u00a79622(a)\u2013(c). And because parties who\nsettle with the federal government may seek cleanup costs\nthey incurred prior to settlement from other potentially re-\n\f6          ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\nsponsible parties, subsection (e)(6) bars a potentially re-\nsponsible party from taking unauthorized remedial\nmeasures. See \u00a7\u00a7922(e)(1)\u2013(3), (h). This ensures the gov-\nernment can control the shape of any final settlement and\nno private party can unilaterally incur costs that it might\nthen foist on others. At the end of it all, the section does\njust what its title suggests. It governs the settlement pro-\ncess among those who have something to settle. It says\nnothing about the rights and duties of individuals who, like\nthe landowners here, have nothing to settle because they\nface no potential liability.\n   Then there\u2019s what the rest of the statute tells us. As\nwe\u2019ve seen, CERCLA says again and again that it does not\nimpair the rights of individuals under state law. That in-\nstruction makes perfect sense and does plenty of work if\n\u00a7122 only requires those potentially liable to the federal\ngovernment to secure permission before engaging in\ncleanup efforts. By contrast, reading \u00a7122 to bar nearly\neveryone from undertaking remedial efforts without federal\npermission renders CERCLA\u2019s many and emphatic prom-\nises about protecting existing state law rights practically\ndead letters. Sure, the federal government would still have\nto \u201cinvolv[e]\u201d state officials and comply with state laws\u2014or\nat least those laws federal agency employees deem \u201crele-\nvant and appropriate.\u201d \u00a7\u00a79621(f )(1), (d)(2)(A)(ii). But\nCERCLA would promise nothing more than observer status\nfor state law and those who wish to rely on it. States and\nprivate landowners alike who lack any potential federal li-\nability could be barred even from undertaking remedial ef-\nforts on their own lands at their own expense, required in-\nstead to host toxic wastes involuntarily and indefinitely.\nRather than supplementing state remedial efforts,\nCERCLA would rule them all.\n   Reading CERCLA this way would raise uneasy constitu-\ntional questions too. If CERCLA really did allow the federal\ngovernment to order innocent landowners to house another\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

See\nLoretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S.\n419, 421 (1982). And if the statute really did grant the fed-\neral government the power to regulate virtually each shov-\nelful of dirt homeowners may dig on their own properties, it\nwould sorely test the reaches of Congress\u2019s power under the\nCommerce Clause. See National Federation of Independent\nBusiness v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. 519, 551\u2013553 (2012).\n   Atlantic Richfield\u2019s replies do nothing to address these\nproblems. Instead of making some helpful textual or con-\ntextual rejoinder about \u00a7122, the company asks us look\nsomewhere else entirely. Now, Atlantic Richfield says, we\nshould direct our attention to \u00a7107, a provision that lists\nfour classes of \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d the federal government\nis authorized to sue under CERCLA. One of these classes\nencompasses any person who owns a \u201cfacility\u201d where haz-\nardous waste has \u201ccome to be located.\u201d \u00a7\u00a79607, 9601(9). Be-\ncause the landowners\u2019 properties qualify as \u201cfacilit[ies]\u201d\nwhere Atlantic Richfield\u2019s waste has come to be located,\neveryone admits the landowners themselves are \u201c[c]overed\npersons.\u201d And, according to Atlantic Richfield, this neces-\nsarily means they are also \u201cpotentially responsible\npart[ies]\u201d subject to \u00a7122(e)(6)\u2019s requirement that they seek\nfederal permission before proceeding with any cleanup.\n   But notice the linguistic contortion and logical leap. Lin-\nguistically, \u00a7107 identifies the \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d the gov-\nernment is authorized to sue. Section 122 requires a \u201cpo-\ntentially responsible party\u201d seeking settlement with and\ndischarge of liability from the federal government to obtain\nits permission before engaging in a cleanup. The terms use\ndifferent language, appear in different statutory sections,\nand address different matters. Nor are these two sections\nthe only ones like them. CERCLA differentiates between\ncovered persons and potentially responsible parties in\nmany places: Some sections apply to all persons covered by\n\f8          ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\n\u00a7107 (see, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a79619(d), 9624(b)), while others\nextend their mandates only to potentially responsible par-\nties (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a79604, 9605, 9611). Logically, too, the con-\ncepts are distinct. Yes, a potentially responsible party must\nbe a covered person the government is authorized to sue.\nBut the inverse does not follow. It is possible to be a person\nthe government is authorized to sue without also being a\nperson the government has chosen to single out for poten-\ntial responsibility. Atlantic Richfield\u2019s argument, thus, es-\nsentially proceeds like this: Disregard the differences in\nlanguage; then assume Congress chose its terms randomly\nthroughout the law; and, finally, conflate logically distinct\nconcepts.\n   Our case illustrates the significance of the distinction\nCongress drew and Atlantic Richfield would have us ignore.\nMaybe the federal government was once authorized by \u00a7107\nto include the innocent landowners here in a CERCLA suit.\nBut few statutes pursue their purpose single-mindedly or\nrequire their full enforcement. And as we\u2019ve seen, at least\ntwo things happened that preclude these landowners from\nbeing held responsible for anything: The government chose\nnot to notify them of potential liability under \u00a7122(e)(3),\nand it declined to bring suit within the period prescribed by\n\u00a7113(g)(2)(B). Under the plain and ordinary meaning of the\nstatutory terms before us, these landowners are not poten-\ntially responsible parties and CERCLA doesn\u2019t require\nthem to seek permission from federal officials before clean-\ning their own lands. If Congress had wished to extend its\nask-before-cleaning rule to every covered person\u2014includ-\ning those the government chooses not to pursue for poten-\ntial liability\u2014all it had to do was say so. Congress dis-\nplayed no trouble using the term \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d\nelsewhere in the statute. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a79619(d), 9624(b)(2).\nConspicuously, it made a different choice here.\n   Without any plausible foundation in the statute to sup-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Maybe the terms \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d and \u201cpoten-\ntially responsible party\u201d are different and the statute uses\nthem in different places to do different things. But, the\ncompany insists, we must conflate them now because this\nCourt has conflated them before. In particular, Atlantic\nRichfield points to language in United States v. Atlantic Re-\nsearch Corp., 551 U. S. 128 (2007), where the Court spoke\nof \u201cSection 107(a) [as] defin[ing] four categories of PRPs [po-\ntentially responsible parties].\u201d Id., at 131\u2013132.\n   That may be so but it does not make it so. The relation-\nship between the terms \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d under \u00a7107 and\n\u201cpotentially responsible part[ies]\u201d under \u00a7122 is of critical\nimportance in this case, but it was not briefed, argued, or\ndecided in Atlantic Research. Instead, the only question\nthere concerned the meaning of the term \u201c[c]overed per-\nsons\u201d under \u00a7107. Though the Court employed the term\n\u201cPRP\u201d to describe \u201c[c]overed persons,\u201d nothing turned on\nthe use or meaning of the acronym: Replace every reference\nto \u201cPRP\u201d with \u201c[c]overed person\u201d and the Court\u2019s holding\nand reasoning remains the same. This Court has long\nwarned that matters \u201c \u2018lurk[ing] in the record, neither\nbrought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon,\u2019 \u201d\nshould not be read as having decided anything. Cooper In-\ndustries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 170\n(2004) (quoting Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925)).\nWe have warned, too, against reading our judicial opinions\nas if they were some sort of legislative code because, other-\nwise, innocent and inconsequential judicial remarks might\nmistakenly come to trump democratically adopted laws.\nSee Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 341 (1979). At-\nlantic Richfield would have us ignore these teachings and\nconfuse a stray remark with a rule of law.\n   In the end, the company\u2019s case cannot help but be seen\nfor what it really is: an appeal to policy. On its view, things\nwould be so much more orderly if the federal government\n\f10         ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\nran everything. And, let\u2019s be honest, the implication here\nis that property owners cannot be trusted to clean up their\nlands without causing trouble (especially for Atlantic Rich-\nfield). Nor, we are told, should Montanans worry so much:\nThe restrictions Atlantic Richfield proposes aren\u2019t really\nthat draconian because homeowners would still be free to\ndo things like build sandboxes for their grandchildren (pro-\nvided, of course, they don\u2019t scoop out too much arsenic in\nthe process).\n   But, as in so many cases that come before this Court, the\npolicy arguments here cut both ways. Maybe paternalistic\ncentral planning cannot tolerate parallel state law efforts\nto restore state lands. But maybe, too, good government\nand environmental protection would be better served if\nstate law remedies proceeded alongside federal efforts.\nState and federal law enforcement usually work in just this\nway, complementing rather than displacing one another.\nAnd, anyway, how long would Atlantic Richfield have us en-\nforce what amounts to a federal easement requiring land-\nowners to house toxic waste on their lands? The govern-\nment has been on site since 1983; work supposedly finished\naround the landowners\u2019 homes in 2016; the completion of\n\u201cprimary\u201d cleanup efforts is \u201cestimated\u201d to happen by 2025.\nSo, yes, once a Superfund site is \u201cdelisted,\u201d the restrictions\non potentially responsible parties fade away. But this pro-\nject is well on its way to the half-century mark and still only\na \u201cpreliminary\u201d deadline lies on the horizon. No one before\nus will even hazard a guess when the work will finish and\na \u201cdelisting\u201d might come. On Atlantic Richfield\u2019s view, gen-\nerations have come and gone and more may follow before\nthe plaintiffs can clean their land.\n   The real problem, of course, is that Congress, not this\nCourt, is supposed to make judgments between competing\npolicy arguments like these. And, as we\u2019ve seen, Congress\nhas offered its judgment repeatedly and clearly. CERCLA\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\nsought to add to, not detract from, state law remedial ef-\nforts. It endorsed a federalized, not a centralized, approach\nto environmental protection. What if private or state\ncleanup efforts really do somehow interfere with federal in-\nterests? Congress didn\u2019t neglect the possibility. But in-\nstead of requiring state officials and local landowners to beg\nWashington for permission, Congress authorized the fed-\neral government to seek injunctive relief in court. See\n\u00a79606(a). Atlantic Richfield would have us turn this system\nupside down, recasting the statute\u2019s presumption in favor\nof cooperative federalism into a presumption of federal\nabsolutism.\n   While I agree with the Court\u2019s assessment in Parts I and\nII of its opinion that we have jurisdiction to hear this case,\nI cannot agree with its ruling on the merits in Part III. De-\nparting from CERCLA\u2019s terms in this way transforms it\nfrom a law that supplements state environmental restora-\ntion efforts into one that prohibits them. Along the way, it\nstrips away ancient common law rights from innocent land-\nowners and forces them to suffer toxic waste in their back-\nyards, playgrounds, and farms. Respectfully, that is not\nwhat the law was written to do; that is what it was written\nto prevent.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2019                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

The\nsame principle holds true for parties facing no liability because of the\nAct\u2019s limitations period.\n   Interpreting \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d to include owners of\npolluted property reflects the Act\u2019s objective to develop a \u201cComprehen-\nsive Environmental Response\u201d to hazardous waste pollution. Section\n122(e)(6) is one of several tools in the Act that ensure the careful de-\nvelopment of a single EPA-led cleanup effort rather than tens of thou-\nsands of competing individual ones.\n   Yet under the landowners\u2019 interpretation, property owners would be\nfree to dig up arsenic-infected soil and build trenches to redirect lead-\ncontaminated groundwater without even notifying EPA, so long as\nthey have not been sued within six years of commencement of the\ncleanup. Congress did not provide such a fragile remedy for such a\nserious problem.\n   The landowners alternatively argue that they are not potentially re-\nsponsible parties because they did not receive the notice of settlement\nnegotiations required by \u00a7122(e)(1). EPA has a policy of not suing in-\nnocent homeowners for pollution they did not cause, so it did not in-\nclude the landowners in settlement negotiations.

After\nCongress passed the Superfund statute in 1980, Atlantic\nRichfield faced strict and retroactive liability for the many\ntons of arsenic and lead that Anaconda had spewed across\nthe area over the previous century. In 1983, EPA desig-\nnated an area of more than 300 square miles around the\nsmelters as one of the inaugural Superfund sites. 48 Fed.\nReg. 40667. In the 35 years since, EPA has managed an\nextensive cleanup at the site, working with Atlantic Rich-\nfield to remediate more than 800 residential and commer-\ncial properties; remove 10 million cubic yards of tailings,\nmine waste, and contaminated soil; cap in place 500 million\ncubic yards of waste over 5,000 acres; and reclaim 12,500\nacres of land. EPA, Superfund Priority \u201cAnaconda\u201d 9 (Apr.\n2018), https://semspub.epa.gov/work/08/100003986.pdf. To\ndate, Atlantic Richfield estimates that it has spent roughly\n$450 million implementing EPA\u2019s orders.\n   More work remains. As of 2015, EPA\u2019s plan anticipated\ncleanup of more than 1,000 additional residential yards, re-\nvegetation of 7,000 acres of uplands, removal of several\nwaste areas, and closure of contaminated stream banks and\nrailroad beds.

As a result, the Montana courts retain jurisdiction\nover this lawsuit, notwithstanding the channeling of Super-\nfund claims to federal courts in \u00a7113(b).5\n   Atlantic Richfield takes a different view, arguing that\n\u00a7113(h) implicitly broadens the scope of actions precluded\nfrom state court jurisdiction under \u00a7113(b). Section 113(h)\nstates that \u201c[n]o Federal court shall have jurisdiction under\nFederal law other than under section 1332 of title 28 (relat-\ning to diversity of citizenship jurisdiction) . . . to review any\nchallenges to removal or remedial action\u201d selected under\nthe Act. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a79613(h).\n   The company\u2019s argument proceeds in five steps. Step\none: Section 113(h) removes federal court jurisdiction over\nall cleanup challenges, regardless of whether they originate\nin federal or state law (except for when the court is sitting\nin diversity). Step two: Section 113(h) can only remove ju-\nrisdiction that \u00a7113(b) provides in the first place. Step\nthree: Section 113(b) thus provides federal courts jurisdic-\ntion over all cleanup challenges, whether brought under\nfederal or state law. Step four: The grant of jurisdiction to\nfederal courts in \u00a7113(b) is exclusive to federal courts. Step\nfive: State courts thus do not have jurisdiction over cleanup\nchallenges.\n   This interpretation faces several insurmountable obsta-\ncles. First, by its own terms, \u00a7113(h) speaks of \u201cFederal\ncourt[s],\u201d not state courts. There is no textual basis for At-\nlantic Richfield\u2019s argument that Congress precluded state\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Section 113(b) specifies that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction\n\n\u201cwithout regard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in contro-\nversy.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a79613(b).

S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts from hearing a category of cases in \u00a7113(b) by strip-\nping federal courts of jurisdiction over those cases in\n\u00a7113(h). And if that were Congress\u2019s goal, it would be hard\nto imagine a more oblique way of achieving it. Often the\nsimplest explanation is the best: Section 113(b) deprives\nstate courts of jurisdiction over cases \u201carising under\u201d the\nAct\u2014just as it says\u2014while \u00a7113(h) deprives federal courts\nof jurisdiction over certain \u201cchallenges\u201d to Superfund reme-\ndial actions\u2014just as it says.\n   Second, the company\u2019s argument does not account for the\nexception in \u00a7113(h) for federal courts sitting in diversity.\nSection 113(h) permits federal courts in diversity cases to\nentertain state law claims regardless of whether they are\nchallenges to cleanup plans.

The same principle holds true for\nparties that face no liability because of the Act\u2019s limitations\nperiod.\n  Interpreting \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d to include\nowners of polluted property reflects the Act\u2019s objective to\ndevelop, as its name suggests, a \u201cComprehensive Environ-\nmental Response\u201d to hazardous waste pollution. Section\n122(e)(6) is one of several tools in the Act that ensure the\ncareful development of a single EPA-led cleanup effort ra-\nther than tens of thousands of competing individual ones.\n  Yet under the landowners\u2019 interpretation, property own-\ners would be free to dig up arsenic-infected soil and build\ntrenches to redirect lead-contaminated groundwater with-\nout even notifying EPA, so long as they have not been sued\nwithin six years of commencement of the cleanup.7 We\ndoubt Congress provided such a fragile remedy for such a\nserious problem.

More importantly, the landowners\u2019 interpre-\ntation would require EPA to monitor tens of thousands of properties\nacross 1,335 Superfund sites nationwide to ensure landowners do not\nderail an EPA cleanup. EPA, Superfund: National Priorities List (NPL)\n(Apr. 13, 2020), https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-\npriorities-list-npl.

I thus agree with the Court that we possess jurisdic-\ntion to decide this case. See ante, at 8. I also agree that the\nlandowners are potentially responsible parties under\n\u00a7122(e)(6) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and, as\na result, cannot bring their Montana restoration damages\nclaim without the consent of the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA). See ante, at 13\u201321. At this point, however,\nI am not willing to endorse the Court\u2019s holding in Part II\u2013B\nthat state courts have jurisdiction to entertain \u201cchallenges\u201d\nto EPA-approved CERCLA plans.\n                               I\n   I would not decide that question because it is neither nec-\nessary nor prudent for us to do so. As I understand the\nCourt\u2019s opinion, the Montana Supreme Court has two op-\ntions on remand: (1) enter a stay to allow the landowners to\nseek EPA approval or (2) enter judgment against the land-\nowners on their restoration damages claim without preju-\ndice to their ability to refile if they obtain EPA approval.\nEither way, the case cannot proceed without the EPA\u2019s\n\f2            ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v.

And because the EPA has submitted multiple fil-\nings indicating that it believes that the landowners\u2019 plan\npresents serious environmental risks, it is likely that the\nEPA will not approve that plan, and the case will then die.\nIf that happens, the question of the state courts\u2019 jurisdiction\nwill be academic.\n   Alternatively, if the EPA approves the landowners\u2019 plan,\neither in full or to a degree that they find satisfactory, they\nmay not wish to press this litigation. And if they do choose\nto go forward, the question of state-court jurisdiction can be\ndecided at that time.\n   For these reasons, there is no need to reach out and de-\ncide the question now,1 and there are good reasons not to do\nso. While the question of state-court jurisdiction may turn\nout not to matter in this case, that question may have im-\nportant implications in other cases. Specifically, if the fears\nexpressed by the Government materialize, state courts and\njuries, eager to serve local interests, may disregard the\nEPA\u2019s expert judgment regarding the best plan for a\nCERCLA site and may mandate relief that exacerbates en-\nvironmental problems.

The question of state-court jurisdiction is only one of\nmany in this case, and the briefing and argument on that\nissue left important questions without fully satisfactory an-\nswers. The Court tries to clear up what \u00a7113 means, but as\nI will attempt to show, the Court\u2019s interpretation presents\nserious problems. Under these circumstances, the better\ncourse is not to decide this perplexing question at this\njuncture.\n                               II\n                               A\n  CERCLA \u00a7113 is like a puzzle with pieces that are ex-\nceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to fit together.

Ante, at 8\u20139.\n   The Court interprets the phrase \u201carising under\u201d in\n\u00a7113(b) to mean the same thing as that phrase means in the\nfederal-question jurisdiction statute, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71331.\nUnder that provision, as the Court puts it, \u201c[i]n the mine\nrun of cases, \u2018[a] suit arises under the law that creates the\ncause of action.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9 (quoting American Well Works\nCo. v.

Thus,\nthe Court concludes, a claim arises under CERCLA only if\nit is based on CERCLA, and since the landowners\u2019 restora-\ntion damages claim is based on Montana law, it is obviously\nnot based on CERCLA and does not fall within the exclusive\njurisdiction conferred on the district courts by \u00a7113(b). This\nmakes short work of the question of state-court jurisdiction,\nbut it presents serious problems.\n   First, it cannot explain why \u00a7113(b) says that the juris-\ndiction it confers is \u201cwithout regard to the citizenship of the\nparties or the amount in controversy.\u201d If that jurisdiction\nis limited to claims that are based on CERCLA, district\ncourts have jurisdiction to entertain all those claims under\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71331, which does not require either diversity or\nany minimum amount in controversy. So why go out of the\nway to say that \u00a7113(b) jurisdiction does not require diver-\nsity or any minimum amount in controversy? The only log-\nical reason is to ensure that the provision covers suits that\ncould not be brought under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a71331. Thus, \u00a7113(b)\njurisdiction must be broader than general federal-question\njurisdiction. By denying this, the Court\u2019s interpretation\nturns the phrase \u201cwithout regard to the citizenship of the\nparties or the amount in controversy\u201d into a meaningless\nand useless appendage.\n   Second, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, there is no rea-\nson why \u00a7113(h) should specify that its reduction of the\nscope of the jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7113(b) does not affect\n\f6            ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\na district court\u2019s jurisdiction in diversity cases. If the juris-\ndiction granted by \u00a7113(b) is limited to claims based on\nCERCLA, why would anyone think that it had any impact\non state-law claims?2\n  Third, if the jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7113(b) is limited to\nclaims based on CERCLA, it is unclear how a district court\ncould entertain a claim \u201cunder State law which is applicable\nor relevant and appropriate under [\u00a7121] (relating to\ncleanup standards).\u201d Yet \u00a7113(h) exempts such a claim\nfrom its general withdrawal of jurisdiction over challenges\nto removal or remedial action. It seems clear that Congress\ndid not regard these claims as claims under CERCLA itself,\nsince it describes them as \u201cunder State law\u201d and did not in-\nclude them on the list of claims under CERCLA that it like-\nwise exempted from \u00a7113(h)\u2019s general withdrawal of juris-\ndiction over challenges to removal or remedial action.\n\u00a7\u00a7113(h)(1)\u2013(5). These three problems raise serious doubt\nabout the correctness of the Court\u2019s interpretation.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court answers that \u00a7\u00a7113(b) and (h), though partially overlap-\n\nping, are \u201cindependent\u201d of each other. Ante, at 13, and n. 6. But this\nconclusion rests on an uneasy premise: that \u00a7113(b) pertains only to\ncauses of action based on CERCLA.

See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23\u201324.

And States have long allowed\nlandowners to seek redress for the pollution of their lands\nthrough ancient common law causes of action like nuisance\nand trespass. The landowners employed exactly these the-\nories when they brought suit in state court seeking restora-\ntion damages from Atlantic Richfield\u2014money that could be\nused only to remove arsenic, lead, and other toxins from\ntheir properties. The Montana Supreme Court has held\nthat the landowners\u2019 case states a viable claim for relief and\nwarrants trial.\n   Now, however, Atlantic Richfield wants us to call a halt\nto the proceedings. The company insists that CERCLA\npreempts and prohibits common law tort suits like this one.\nOn Atlantic Richfield\u2019s telling, CERCLA even prevents pri-\nvate landowners from voluntarily remediating their own\nproperties at their own expense. No one may do anything\nin 300 square miles of Montana, the company insists, with-\nout first securing the federal government\u2019s permission.\n   But what in the law commands that result? Everything\nin CERCLA suggests that it seeks to supplement, not sup-\nplant, traditional state law remedies and promote, not pro-\nhibit, efforts to restore contaminated land. Congress hardly\ncould have been clearer. It stated that, \u201c[n]othing in this\n[Act] shall be construed or interpreted as preempting any\nState from imposing any additional liability or require-\nments with respect to the release of hazardous substances\nwithin such State.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a79614(a).

And it said again that \u201c[t]his [Act]\ndoes not affect or otherwise impair the rights of any person\nunder Federal, State, or common law, except with respect\nto the timing of review as provided\u201d elsewhere in provisions\n\f4           ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v.

After\nall, merely \u201c[i]nvoking some brooding federal interest or ap-\npealing to a judicial policy preference should never be\nenough to win preemption of a state law\u201d; instead, a party\nlike Atlantic Richfield seeking to displace state law must\nidentify \u201c \u2018a constitutional text or a federal statute\u2019 that does\nthe displacing.\u201d Virginia Uranium, Inc. v.

Subsection\n(e)(6) bears the title \u201cInconsistent response action\u201d and\nstates that, \u201c[w]hen either the President, or a potentially\nresponsible party pursuant to an administrative order or\nconsent decree under this chapter, has initiated a remedial\ninvestigation and feasibility study for a particular facility\nunder this chapter, no potentially responsible party may\nundertake any remedial action at the facility unless such\nremedial action has been authorized by the President.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a79622(e)(6).

When interpreting a statute, this\nCourt applies the law\u2019s ordinary public meaning at the time\nof the statute\u2019s adoption, here 1980. See Wisconsin Central\nLtd. v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at\n9). To be \u201cpotentially responsible\u201d for something meant\nthen, as it does today, that a person could possibly be held\naccountable for it; the outcome is capable of happening.\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1025 (1981); Webster\u2019s New\nCollegiate Dictionary 893 (1980). And there is simply no\nway the landowners here are potentially, possibly, or capa-\nble of being held liable by the federal government for any-\nthing. In the first place, the federal government never no-\ntified the landowners that they might be responsible\nparties, as it must under \u00a7122(e)(1). Additionally, everyone\nadmits that the period allowed for bringing a CERLCA\nclaim against them has long since passed under\n\u00a7113(g)(2)(B). On any reasonable account, the landowners\nare potentially responsible to the government for exactly\nnothing.\n   Statutory context is of a piece with the narrow text.\nNothing in \u00a7122 affects the rights of strangers to the federal\ngovernment\u2019s settlement process. Everything in the section\nspeaks to the details of that process. The section requires\nthe government to provide all potentially responsible par-\nties with notice that they might be held responsible for re-\nmedial measures. \u00a79622(e)(1). It instructs the government\nto give a potentially responsible party a list of everyone else\nso designated.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"ibid_token\">Ibid.</span> It specifies procedures </span><pre class=\"inline\">for sharing\nproposals and counterproposals among this group.\n\u00a7\u00a79622(e)(2)\u2013(3). It allows the government to release from\nfederal liability those who agree to settle and clean up haz-\nardous sites. See \u00a7\u00a79622(a)\u2013(c). And because parties who\nsettle with the federal government may seek cleanup costs\nthey incurred prior to settlement from other potentially re-\n\f6          ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\nsponsible parties, subsection (e)(6) bars a potentially re-\nsponsible party from taking unauthorized remedial\nmeasures. See \u00a7\u00a7922(e)(1)\u2013(3), (h). This ensures the gov-\nernment can control the shape of any final settlement and\nno private party can unilaterally incur costs that it might\nthen foist on others. At the end of it all, the section does\njust what its title suggests. It governs the settlement pro-\ncess among those who have something to settle. It says\nnothing about the rights and duties of individuals who, like\nthe landowners here, have nothing to settle because they\nface no potential liability.\n   Then there\u2019s what the rest of the statute tells us. As\nwe\u2019ve seen, CERCLA says again and again that it does not\nimpair the rights of individuals under state law. That in-\nstruction makes perfect sense and does plenty of work if\n\u00a7122 only requires those potentially liable to the federal\ngovernment to secure permission before engaging in\ncleanup efforts. By contrast, reading \u00a7122 to bar nearly\neveryone from undertaking remedial efforts without federal\npermission renders CERCLA\u2019s many and emphatic prom-\nises about protecting existing state law rights practically\ndead letters. Sure, the federal government would still have\nto \u201cinvolv[e]\u201d state officials and comply with state laws\u2014or\nat least those laws federal agency employees deem \u201crele-\nvant and appropriate.\u201d \u00a7\u00a79621(f )(1), (d)(2)(A)(ii). But\nCERCLA would promise nothing more than observer status\nfor state law and those who wish to rely on it. States and\nprivate landowners alike who lack any potential federal li-\nability could be barred even from undertaking remedial ef-\nforts on their own lands at their own expense, required in-\nstead to host toxic wastes involuntarily and indefinitely.\nRather than supplementing state remedial efforts,\nCERCLA would rule them all.\n   Reading CERCLA this way would raise uneasy constitu-\ntional questions too. If CERCLA really did allow the federal\ngovernment to order innocent landowners to house another\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

Instead of making some helpful textual or con-\ntextual rejoinder about \u00a7122, the company asks us look\nsomewhere else entirely. Now, Atlantic Richfield says, we\nshould direct our attention to \u00a7107, a provision that lists\nfour classes of \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d the federal government\nis authorized to sue under CERCLA. One of these classes\nencompasses any person who owns a \u201cfacility\u201d where haz-\nardous waste has \u201ccome to be located.\u201d \u00a7\u00a79607, 9601(9). Be-\ncause the landowners\u2019 properties qualify as \u201cfacilit[ies]\u201d\nwhere Atlantic Richfield\u2019s waste has come to be located,\neveryone admits the landowners themselves are \u201c[c]overed\npersons.\u201d And, according to Atlantic Richfield, this neces-\nsarily means they are also \u201cpotentially responsible\npart[ies]\u201d subject to \u00a7122(e)(6)\u2019s requirement that they seek\nfederal permission before proceeding with any cleanup.\n   But notice the linguistic contortion and logical leap. Lin-\nguistically, \u00a7107 identifies the \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d the gov-\nernment is authorized to sue. Section 122 requires a \u201cpo-\ntentially responsible party\u201d seeking settlement with and\ndischarge of liability from the federal government to obtain\nits permission before engaging in a cleanup. The terms use\ndifferent language, appear in different statutory sections,\nand address different matters. Nor are these two sections\nthe only ones like them. CERCLA differentiates between\ncovered persons and potentially responsible parties in\nmany places: Some sections apply to all persons covered by\n\f8          ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\n\u00a7107 (see, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7\u00a79619(d), 9624(b)), while others\nextend their mandates only to potentially responsible par-\nties (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a79604, 9605, 9611). Logically, too, the con-\ncepts are distinct. Yes, a potentially responsible party must\nbe a covered person the government is authorized to sue.\nBut the inverse does not follow. It is possible to be a person\nthe government is authorized to sue without also being a\nperson the government has chosen to single out for poten-\ntial responsibility. Atlantic Richfield\u2019s argument, thus, es-\nsentially proceeds like this: Disregard the differences in\nlanguage; then assume Congress chose its terms randomly\nthroughout the law; and, finally, conflate logically distinct\nconcepts.\n   Our case illustrates the significance of the distinction\nCongress drew and Atlantic Richfield would have us ignore.\nMaybe the federal government was once authorized by \u00a7107\nto include the innocent landowners here in a CERCLA suit.\nBut few statutes pursue their purpose single-mindedly or\nrequire their full enforcement. And as we\u2019ve seen, at least\ntwo things happened that preclude these landowners from\nbeing held responsible for anything: The government chose\nnot to notify them of potential liability under \u00a7122(e)(3),\nand it declined to bring suit within the period prescribed by\n\u00a7113(g)(2)(B). Under the plain and ordinary meaning of the\nstatutory terms before us, these landowners are not poten-\ntially responsible parties and CERCLA doesn\u2019t require\nthem to seek permission from federal officials before clean-\ning their own lands. If Congress had wished to extend its\nask-before-cleaning rule to every covered person\u2014includ-\ning those the government chooses not to pursue for poten-\ntial liability\u2014all it had to do was say so. Congress dis-\nplayed no trouble using the term \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d\nelsewhere in the statute. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a79619(d), 9624(b)(2).\nConspicuously, it made a different choice here.\n   Without any plausible foundation in the statute to sup-\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U.

The relation-\nship between the terms \u201c[c]overed persons\u201d under \u00a7107 and\n\u201cpotentially responsible part[ies]\u201d under \u00a7122 is of critical\nimportance in this case, but it was not briefed, argued, or\ndecided in Atlantic Research. Instead, the only question\nthere concerned the meaning of the term \u201c[c]overed per-\nsons\u201d under \u00a7107. Though the Court employed the term\n\u201cPRP\u201d to describe \u201c[c]overed persons,\u201d nothing turned on\nthe use or meaning of the acronym: Replace every reference\nto \u201cPRP\u201d with \u201c[c]overed person\u201d and the Court\u2019s holding\nand reasoning remains the same.

At-\nlantic Richfield would have us ignore these teachings and\nconfuse a stray remark with a rule of law.\n   In the end, the company\u2019s case cannot help but be seen\nfor what it really is: an appeal to policy. On its view, things\nwould be so much more orderly if the federal government\n\f10         ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO. v. CHRISTIAN\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\nran everything. And, let\u2019s be honest, the implication here\nis that property owners cannot be trusted to clean up their\nlands without causing trouble (especially for Atlantic Rich-\nfield). Nor, we are told, should Montanans worry so much:\nThe restrictions Atlantic Richfield proposes aren\u2019t really\nthat draconian because homeowners would still be free to\ndo things like build sandboxes for their grandchildren (pro-\nvided, of course, they don\u2019t scoop out too much arsenic in\nthe process).\n   But, as in so many cases that come before this Court, the\npolicy arguments here cut both ways. Maybe paternalistic\ncentral planning cannot tolerate parallel state law efforts\nto restore state lands. But maybe, too, good government\nand environmental protection would be better served if\nstate law remedies proceeded alongside federal efforts.\nState and federal law enforcement usually work in just this\nway, complementing rather than displacing one another.\nAnd, anyway, how long would Atlantic Richfield have us en-\nforce what amounts to a federal easement requiring land-\nowners to house toxic waste on their lands? The govern-\nment has been on site since 1983; work supposedly finished\naround the landowners\u2019 homes in 2016; the completion of\n\u201cprimary\u201d cleanup efforts is \u201cestimated\u201d to happen by 2025.\nSo, yes, once a Superfund site is \u201cdelisted,\u201d the restrictions\non potentially responsible parties fade away. But this pro-\nject is well on its way to the half-century mark and still only\na \u201cpreliminary\u201d deadline lies on the horizon. No one before\nus will even hazard a guess when the work will finish and\na \u201cdelisting\u201d might come. On Atlantic Richfield\u2019s view, gen-\nerations have come and gone and more may follow before\nthe plaintiffs can clean their land.\n   The real problem, of course, is that Congress, not this\nCourt, is supposed to make judgments between competing\npolicy arguments like these. And, as we\u2019ve seen, Congress\nhas offered its judgment repeatedly and clearly. CERCLA\n\f                  Cite as: 590 U. S. ____ (2020)           11\n\n                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.\n\nsought to add to, not detract from, state law remedial ef-\nforts. It endorsed a federalized, not a centralized, approach\nto environmental protection. What if private or state\ncleanup efforts really do somehow interfere with federal in-\nterests? Congress didn\u2019t neglect the possibility. But in-\nstead of requiring state officials and local landowners to beg\nWashington for permission, Congress authorized the fed-\neral government to seek injunctive relief in court. See\n\u00a79606(a). Atlantic Richfield would have us turn this system\nupside down, recasting the statute\u2019s presumption in favor\nof cooperative federalism into a presumption of federal\nabsolutism.\n   While I agree with the Court\u2019s assessment in Parts I and\nII of its opinion that we have jurisdiction to hear this case,\nI cannot agree with its ruling on the merits in Part III. De-\nparting from CERCLA\u2019s terms in this way transforms it\nfrom a law that supplements state environmental restora-\ntion efforts into one that prohibits them. Along the way, it\nstrips away ancient common law rights from innocent land-\nowners and forces them to suffer toxic waste in their back-\nyards, playgrounds, and farms. Respectfully, that is not\nwhat the law was written to do; that is what it was written\nto prevent.\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/137734/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/110101/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118153/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118410/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/117902/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/96405/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112039/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1451436/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/98740/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145719/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/100541/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/110783/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109385/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109522/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/110932/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118229/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2620886/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145879/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/889691/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145629/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/105317/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112357/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145900/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/96594/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/887957/"]}]
